In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel decentralized framework for task allocation in heterogeneous agent teams, leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach, called HetMAT, uses a hierarchical GCN architecture to learn a comprehensive representation of the agent-task graph, enabling agents to make informed decisions about task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HetMAT outperforms traditional distributed constraint optimization methods, achieving higher task completion rates and improved robustness to agent failures.
