Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex network data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph structures and the need to minimize communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization and cost-based optimization to reduce query latency. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 3x, while maintaining high accuracy and scalability.
