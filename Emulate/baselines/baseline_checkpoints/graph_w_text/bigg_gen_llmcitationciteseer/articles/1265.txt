Coordinating multiple agents to achieve complex tasks requires effective communication and cooperation. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention framework, HierGAT, which enables explainable multi-agent cooperation. HierGAT leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, allowing for more informed decision-making. We evaluate HierGAT on a real-world traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved cooperation efficiency and interpretability compared to existing graph neural network-based methods.
