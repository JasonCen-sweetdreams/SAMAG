Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to effectively re-rank documents based on user queries. This paper proposes a novel neural query graph (NQG) approach that models complex query-document relationships. Our NQG framework represents queries as graphs, which are then used to compute semantic similarities with document graphs. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant query-document interactions, enabling more accurate re-ranking. Experimental results on the TREC dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain compared to state-of-the-art re-ranking methods.
