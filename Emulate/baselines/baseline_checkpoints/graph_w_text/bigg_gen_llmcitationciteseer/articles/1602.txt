Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is key to solving complex problems in domains like robotics and smart cities. However, as the number of agents increases, the size of the joint action space grows exponentially, leading to scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention framework, 'HierGAT', which leverages the inherent graph structure of agent interactions to reduce the dimensionality of the action space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HierGAT in several MARL benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in scalability and solution quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.
