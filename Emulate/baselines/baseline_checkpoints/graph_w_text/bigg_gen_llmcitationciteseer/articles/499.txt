Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the gap between the user's query and the relevant documents. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and relevance feedback, which can be time-consuming and ineffective. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DLQE', which leverages transformer architectures to learn contextualized query and document representations. Our results on the TREC dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, while reducing the need for manual intervention.
