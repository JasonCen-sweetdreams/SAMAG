Autonomous vehicles rely on complex control systems to navigate diverse scenarios. This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework that improves the efficiency and adaptability of autonomous vehicle control. Our approach consists of a high-level policy that selects primitive actions and a low-level controller that executes these actions. We introduce a multi-agent formulation that enables the HRL framework to learn from both expert demonstrations and online experiences, resulting in faster learning and improved robustness. Experimental results on a simulated autonomous driving platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing energy consumption and improving overall vehicle performance.
