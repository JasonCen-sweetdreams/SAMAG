As Augmented Reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, user experience (UX) design plays a critical role in ensuring effective interaction and information comprehension. This study investigates the effects of adaptive iconography on user performance and satisfaction in AR environments. We designed and implemented an AR-based experiment, incorporating icons with varying levels of abstraction and animation. Our results show that adaptive iconography significantly improves task completion time, reduces error rates, and enhances user satisfaction. Furthermore, we identify key factors influencing user preference for icon styles and provide guidelines for AR designers to optimize their iconography.
