Virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) have become increasingly popular, but their security remains an open challenge. This paper presents a novel gaze-based authentication system for VR HMDs, leveraging the unique characteristics of human eye movements to verify user identities. Our approach combines machine learning-based gaze pattern recognition with visual attention modeling to achieve high accuracy and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that our system can detect and prevent unauthorized access with a mean detection rate of 95.2% and a false acceptance rate of 2.5%. We discuss the implications of our work for enhancing the security and trustworthiness of VR applications.
