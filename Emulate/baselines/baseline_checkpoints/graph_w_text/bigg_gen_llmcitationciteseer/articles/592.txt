Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but its adoption is hindered by limitations in user interaction. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interaction framework, ' GestureVR', designed to enhance accessibility and inclusivity in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, including individuals with motor impairments, and demonstrated that GestureVR significantly improves user experience and reduces interaction time compared to traditional controller-based methods. Our approach utilizes machine learning algorithms to recognize and classify hand gestures, allowing for more intuitive and natural interaction with virtual objects.
