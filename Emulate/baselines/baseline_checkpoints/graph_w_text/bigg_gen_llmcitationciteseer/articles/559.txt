In complex systems, decision-making under uncertainty is a challenging task, especially when real-time resource allocation is required. This paper presents a decentralized autonomous agent-based decision support system (DSS) that leverages multi-agent coordination and negotiation to optimize resource allocation in dynamic environments. Our approach integrates machine learning-based predictive models with agent-based reasoning to enable proactive decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed DSS outperforms traditional centralized optimization methods in terms of response time and resource utilization efficiency.
