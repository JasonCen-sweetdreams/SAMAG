Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have gained popularity due to their scalability and flexibility. However, optimizing query performance in multi-tenant environments remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workloads and resource constraints. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan selection policy. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers, achieving up to 30% improvement in query response times and 25% reduction in resource utilization.
