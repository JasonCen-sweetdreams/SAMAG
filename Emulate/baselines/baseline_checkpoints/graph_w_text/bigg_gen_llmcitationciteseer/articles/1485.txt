Autonomous agent systems require reliable trust management mechanisms to ensure secure interactions between agents. This paper presents a decentralized trust management framework, 'BlockTrust', which leverages blockchain technology to establish a tamper-evident reputation system. BlockTrust enables agents to dynamically update their trust relationships based on observed behavior, while maintaining a transparent and immutable record of past interactions. We evaluate BlockTrust using a simulated smart city scenario, demonstrating improved system resilience and security compared to traditional centralized trust management approaches.
