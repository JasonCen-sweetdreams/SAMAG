Eye movement patterns can serve as a valuable indicator of user intent in human-computer interaction. This paper presents EyeGazePath, a machine learning framework that leverages deep learning techniques to predict user intent from eye gaze data. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model the spatial and temporal aspects of eye movement patterns. We evaluate EyeGazePath on a large-scale eye tracking dataset and demonstrate its ability to accurately predict user intent in various scenarios, including web browsing and interactive gaming.
