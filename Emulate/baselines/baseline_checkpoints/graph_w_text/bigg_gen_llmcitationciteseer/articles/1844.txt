Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive results in robotics, but its lack of interpretability hinders its adoption in real-world applications. This paper introduces HAN-RLE, a hierarchical attention network that incorporates multi-level attention mechanisms to provide explainable RL policies for robotic control tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN-RLE in a real-world robotic arm manipulation task, showcasing its ability to generate interpretable attention visualizations that align with human intuition. Our extensive experiments illustrate the improved performance and robustness of HAN-RLE compared to state-of-the-art RL methods.
