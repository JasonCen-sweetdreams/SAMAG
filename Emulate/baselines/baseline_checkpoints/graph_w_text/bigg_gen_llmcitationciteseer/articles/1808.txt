Query expansion techniques are widely used in information retrieval to improve the effectiveness of keyword-based search systems. However, existing methods often suffer from the problem of retrieving redundant or similar documents, which can lead to a poor user experience. This paper proposes a novel aspect-based query expansion approach that incorporates semantic role labeling and entity recognition to identify diverse aspects of the query. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the retrieval of diverse documents, leading to a more comprehensive search result.
