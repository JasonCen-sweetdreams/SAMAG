Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval that aims to improve the retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep semantic word embeddings. We propose a neural network-based model that learns to capture the semantic relationships between words and expands the query with relevant terms. Our approach is shown to outperform traditional query expansion methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling ambiguous queries and improving the retrieval of relevant documents.
