Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of people with disabilities. This paper presents a participatory design approach to develop accessible and inclusive conversational interfaces. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with individuals with disabilities, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our resulting design framework, 'AccessibilityLens', incorporates a range of novel features, including personalized accessibility profiles, real-time transcription, and multimodal input support. A usability study with 25 participants demonstrated significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to existing conversational interfaces.
