Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to achieve a common goal. This paper proposes a novel decentralized coalition formation algorithm, 'CoForm', which enables agents to dynamically form coalitions and allocate tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We model the task allocation problem as a hedonic game and design a distributed protocol that converges to a stable coalition structure. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that CoForm outperforms existing decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion rate and coalition stability.
