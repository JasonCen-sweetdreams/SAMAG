This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities and resources need to be assigned to tasks with varying requirements. We propose a decentralized auction-based mechanism, called 'Distributed Task Auction' (DTA), which enables agents to bid on tasks based on their availability and capabilities. DTA ensures efficient task allocation, fairness, and truthfulness, while minimizing communication overhead. We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of DTA and evaluate its effectiveness through simulations on a range of task allocation scenarios.
