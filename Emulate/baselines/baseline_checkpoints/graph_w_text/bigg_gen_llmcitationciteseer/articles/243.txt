Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used to manage large-scale datasets, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a dynamic replication strategy, called 'DynaRep', which adaptively adjusts the replication factor of frequently accessed data fragments based on query patterns and system workload. Our approach leverages graph-based data partitioning and a cost-benefit analysis to optimize data placement and minimize query latency. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate that DynaRep achieves up to 3.5x improvement in query performance compared to traditional static replication schemes.
