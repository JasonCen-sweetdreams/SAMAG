As database systems continue to scale, traditional concurrency control mechanisms face significant challenges. This paper presents a novel, lock-free approach to concurrency control that leverages a combination of hardware transactional memory and optimistic concurrency protocols. Our proposed system, 'LFCtrl', avoids the limitations of traditional locking and timestamp-based methods, achieving significant improvements in throughput and latency under high contention workloads. We evaluate LFCtrl using a range of benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness in supporting high-performance, scalable database systems.
