Few-shot learning has made significant progress in recent years, but most existing methods rely on a fixed set of classes seen during training. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that can learn novel classes with limited labeled data. Our approach combines a class-agnostic attention mechanism with a hierarchical class embedding strategy, enabling the model to focus on relevant features and adapt to new classes quickly. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot learning scenarios, especially when dealing with novel classes.
