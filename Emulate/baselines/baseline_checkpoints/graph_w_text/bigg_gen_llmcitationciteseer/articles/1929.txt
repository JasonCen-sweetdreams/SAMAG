Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide transparency into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture that leverages item relationships and user preferences to generate personalized recommendations. Our model incorporates a attention-based graph neural network to learn item embeddings, which are then fed into a hierarchical graph attention mechanism to capture complex user-item interactions. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
