Object detection is a critical task in autonomous vehicles, requiring accurate and efficient processing of visual data. This paper introduces HANet, a novel hierarchical attention network that selectively focuses on relevant regions of interest in images. We leverage a multi-scale feature fusion strategy to improve detection accuracy, particularly for small objects. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that HANet outperforms state-of-the-art object detectors while reducing computational overhead by 30%. This makes HANet a promising solution for real-time object detection in autonomous vehicles.
