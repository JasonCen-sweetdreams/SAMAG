Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) systems face the challenge of efficiently processing queries across multiple machines. This paper presents a novel graph-based document clustering approach, termed GraphIR, which reduces the query processing time in DIR systems. GraphIR represents documents as nodes in a graph, where edges denote semantic relationships between documents. By clustering densely connected nodes, GraphIR identifies a set of representative documents that can efficiently answer queries. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that GraphIR outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods, reducing query processing time by up to 30% while maintaining retrieval effectiveness.
