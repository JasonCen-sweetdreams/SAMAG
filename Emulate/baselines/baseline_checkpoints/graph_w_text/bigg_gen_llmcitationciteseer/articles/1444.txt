The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms has severe consequences for individuals and society. While existing detection methods rely on shallow feature engineering or vanilla graph neural networks, we propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that captures complex relationships between news articles, users, and entities. HGAT incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to identify suspicious patterns and provide interpretable explanations for its predictions. Our experiments on a large-scale fake news dataset demonstrate HGAT's superior performance and ability to generalize to unseen news topics.
