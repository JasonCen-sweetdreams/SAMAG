With the proliferation of multi-modal data, there is a growing need for efficient and effective retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for retrieving relevant documents from large-scale collections in response to multi-modal queries. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms at multiple levels to capture intricate relationships between query components and document features. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
