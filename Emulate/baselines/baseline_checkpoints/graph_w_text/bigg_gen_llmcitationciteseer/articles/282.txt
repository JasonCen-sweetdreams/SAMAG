Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the impact of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed an experiment using a novel avatar creation system that incorporates user preferences and personality traits. Our results show that users who interact with personalized avatars exhibit higher levels of engagement, measured through self-reported satisfaction and physiological metrics. We also identify key design factors influencing user acceptance and provide guidelines for VR system designers.
