This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model for efficient document retrieval, leveraging query expansion techniques to improve retrieval accuracy. Our approach, 'NeuRankEx', integrates a deep neural network with a query expansion module to capture nuanced semantic relationships between queries and documents. We evaluate NeuRankEx on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for ambiguous queries. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of query expansion on neural ranking models and provide insights into the optimization of hyperparameters for improved efficiency.
