Accurate and real-time traffic prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. However, existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel GNN architecture, 'TrafficGNN+', which leverages sparse attention mechanisms and knowledge distillation to reduce inference time while maintaining prediction accuracy. We evaluate TrafficGNN+ on three large-scale traffic datasets and demonstrate its ability to predict traffic patterns 15-30 minutes in advance with state-of-the-art accuracy, while being 3-5x faster than existing GNN models.
