The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential increase in time-series sensor data, making anomaly detection a crucial task. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that leverages both local and global patterns in IoT sensor data to detect anomalies. Our approach exploits the hierarchical structure of IoT sensors to learn attention weights, which enables the model to focus on the most informative features and timestamps. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to concept drift.
