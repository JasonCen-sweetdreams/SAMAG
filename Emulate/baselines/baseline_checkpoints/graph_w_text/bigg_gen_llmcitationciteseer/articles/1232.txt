Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in older adults' daily lives, but their usability and accessibility remain a concern. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the design of inclusive voice assistants for older adults. We conducted interviews, surveys, and usability testing with 30 participants aged 65+, identifying key challenges and preferences. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise voice feedback, intuitive command structures, and personalized assistance. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating more accessible and user-friendly voice assistants, which can improve the overall experience and independence of older adults.
