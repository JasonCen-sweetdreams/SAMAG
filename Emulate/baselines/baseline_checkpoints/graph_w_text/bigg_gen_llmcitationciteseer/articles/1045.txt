Short-text retrieval is a challenging task in information retrieval due to the scarcity of relevant terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, LSA-TE, which leverages latent semantic analysis to capture the underlying semantic relationships between terms. Our method incorporates a term embedding module that learns to represent terms in a high-dimensional space, enabling the discovery of nuanced term associations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSA-TE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness to query variations.
