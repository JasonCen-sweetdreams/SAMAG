In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. Existing methods often rely on centralized control or simplistic heuristics, which may not scale to large, heterogeneous teams. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn agent-agent and agent-task affinities. Our approach, called 'HetGNN', models the agent network as a heterogeneous graph and uses attention mechanisms to adaptively weigh the importance of different agents and tasks. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that HetGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, fairness, and robustness to agent failures.
