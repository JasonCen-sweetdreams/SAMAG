E-commerce search engines struggle to balance query latency and retrieval effectiveness, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or incomplete user queries. We propose a neural query expansion (NQE) framework that leverages a transformer-based architecture to generate context-aware expansion terms. NQE incorporates a novel attention mechanism that selectively weighs term importance based on query semantics and item attributes. Our experiments on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and recall, while reducing query latency by up to 30% compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
