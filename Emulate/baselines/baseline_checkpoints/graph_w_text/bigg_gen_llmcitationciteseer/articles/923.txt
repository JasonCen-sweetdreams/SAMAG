Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, optimizing queries for graph databases remains a challenging problem due to the exponential growth of possible query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, where the query optimizer learns to select the most efficient query plan based on rewards generated from execution time and memory usage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, called 'GraphQLearn', on a range of graph datasets and show significant improvements in query performance compared to traditional optimization techniques.
