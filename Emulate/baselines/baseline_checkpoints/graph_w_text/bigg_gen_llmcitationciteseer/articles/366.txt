Real-world graphs, such as social networks and knowledge graphs, are inherently dynamic, with nodes and edges constantly being added or removed. However, most existing graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed for static graphs, and their performance degrades significantly when faced with graph evolution. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that can efficiently adapt to evolving graphs through incremental learning. HGAT uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on the most relevant nodes and edges, and a meta-learning framework to quickly adapt to new graph structures. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in terms of accuracy and efficiency when dealing with graph evolution.
