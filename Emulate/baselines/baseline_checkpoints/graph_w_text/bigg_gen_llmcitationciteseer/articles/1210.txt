Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query processing for complex joins remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called 'DJPart', which leverages both data partitioning and join reordering to minimize communication overhead and improve query performance. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that adaptively selects the best join order and partitioning scheme based on the query workload and data characteristics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DJPart outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
