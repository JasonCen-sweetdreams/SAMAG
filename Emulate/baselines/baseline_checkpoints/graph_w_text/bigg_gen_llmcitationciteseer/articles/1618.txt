Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a multimodal interaction framework, 'ElderVoice', that aims to improve the accessibility and usability of voice assistants for this demographic. Our framework incorporates advanced speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision techniques to support a wide range of interaction modalities, including voice, gesture, and gaze-based input. We evaluate ElderVoice through a user study with 30 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
