Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuanced semantics of user queries. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep graph-based semantic embeddings to model relationships between entities and concepts. Our method, dubbed 'GraphExpan', represents queries as graph structures and applies graph neural networks to learn dense vector representations. These embeddings are then used to identify relevant expansion terms, yielding significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experiments on the TREC Robust04 and ClueWeb09 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphExpan in retrieving relevant documents, particularly for ambiguous and complex queries.
