Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale data. However, efficient indexing techniques for multi-attribute range queries remain a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, called 'Dexi', which leverages a combination of hierarchical clustering and spatial decomposition to facilitate fast query processing. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Dexi outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time, while maintaining a reasonable indexing overhead.
