Search result diversification is crucial for improving user satisfaction in information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep neural networks to generate diversified search results. Our model, called DivExpan, learns to identify relevant expansion terms by capturing semantic relationships between query terms and document contents. We employ a hierarchical attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different terms and phrases, enabling the model to adapt to varying query types and domains. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DivExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of search result diversity and relevance.
