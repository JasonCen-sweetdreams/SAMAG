Distributed resource allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, especially in large-scale networks. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn efficient resource allocation strategies. Our framework, 'AgentGNN', represents the agent network as a graph and uses GNNs to learn node representations that capture complex dependencies between agents. We develop a decentralized allocation algorithm that uses these representations to allocate resources in a scalable and efficient manner. Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentGNN in achieving near-optimal allocation while reducing communication overhead.
