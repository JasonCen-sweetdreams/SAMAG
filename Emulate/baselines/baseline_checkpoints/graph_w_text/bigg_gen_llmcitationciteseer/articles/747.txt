Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly when agents have different capabilities and tasks have diverse requirements. This paper presents a novel approach, 'Deep Allocation', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to coordinate heterogeneous agents. We propose a graph neural network-based architecture that learns to represent task-agent affinity and allocates tasks efficiently. Experimental results on a realistic simulated environment demonstrate that Deep Allocation outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods, reducing task completion time by up to 30% and improving overall system utilization.
