Query expansion is a crucial technique in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on simplistic term weighting and suffer from limited context awareness. This paper proposes a neural query graph embedding (NQGE) approach that jointly models query terms, their relationships, and the document collection. Our NQGE model learns to encode queries as dense vectors, which are then used to expand the original query. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for challenging topics with limited relevant documents.
