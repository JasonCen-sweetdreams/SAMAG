Responding to natural disasters requires coordinated efforts from multiple agents, including first responders, emergency services, and volunteers. This paper presents a novel framework for coordinating multi-agent systems in disaster response scenarios using hierarchical task networks (HTNs). Our approach enables agents to reason about complex tasks, allocate resources, and adapt to changing environmental conditions. We evaluate our framework using a realistic disaster simulation, demonstrating improved response times and resource allocation compared to traditional decentralized approaches. The proposed framework has the potential to save lives and reduce damage in disaster scenarios.
