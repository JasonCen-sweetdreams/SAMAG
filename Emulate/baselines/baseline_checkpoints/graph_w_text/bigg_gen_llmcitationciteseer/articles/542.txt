Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches struggle with scalability and ambiguity in large datasets. This paper presents 'AdaGEM', a novel graph-based embedding method that adaptively incorporates contextual information to disambiguate entities. AdaGEM leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant graph neighborhoods, enabling efficient handling of large-scale datasets. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaGEM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
