Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often involve complex queries that require effective query expansion to retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural query expansion approach, 'HNQE', which leverages a combination of semantic and syntactic features to generate a hierarchical representation of the query. Our experiments on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that HNQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision. Furthermore, we show that HNQE can be efficiently integrated with existing retrieval models, enabling fast document filtering and retrieval.
