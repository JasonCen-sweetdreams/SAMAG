This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for cooperative multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and preferences need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. We design an auction-based mechanism that enables agents to bid for tasks based on their expected utilities, and a sealed-bid Vickrey auction protocol is employed to determine the assignment of tasks to agents. Our approach ensures that agents are incentivized to report their true preferences, leading to efficient task allocation. We evaluate our method through simulations, demonstrating improved system performance and fairness compared to existing decentralized allocation methods.
