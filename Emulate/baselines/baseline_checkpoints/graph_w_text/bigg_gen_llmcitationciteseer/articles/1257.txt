In this paper, we address the problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have different capabilities and tasks have varying requirements. We propose a decentralized deep reinforcement learning framework, 'AgentAllocator', which enables agents to learn effective task allocation policies through self-play. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and attention mechanisms to focus on relevant task features. Experimental results on a simulated robotics domain demonstrate that AgentAllocator outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency and agent utilization.
