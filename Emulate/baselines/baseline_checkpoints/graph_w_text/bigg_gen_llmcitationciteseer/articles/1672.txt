As Virtual Reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding user experience is crucial for designing effective interfaces. This paper proposes a multimodal interaction framework that integrates gaze, gesture, and voice inputs to facilitate seamless user interaction in VR environments. We conducted a user study to evaluate the framework's performance and usability, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. Our framework provides a foundation for developing more immersive and accessible VR experiences.
