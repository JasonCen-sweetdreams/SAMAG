Virtual assistants have become ubiquitous, but their conversational interfaces often exclude older adults due to usability and accessibility limitations. This study investigates the design of inclusive virtual assistants that cater to the needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study, combining user interviews, surveys, and usability testing, to identify the challenges faced by older adults when interacting with conversational interfaces. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise language, visual feedback, and personalized assistance. We propose a set of design guidelines for developing inclusive virtual assistants and demonstrate their efficacy through a prototype evaluation.
