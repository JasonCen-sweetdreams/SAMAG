Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) can benefit from accurate cognitive load detection to provide personalized support. This paper presents a novel gaze-based approach that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect cognitive load in real-time. We developed a wearable eye-tracking device and collected a dataset of gaze patterns from students performing math problems. Our proposed model, 'GazeLearn', achieves a detection accuracy of 87.5% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility of integrating GazeLearn with an ITS to provide adaptive feedback and improve learning outcomes.
