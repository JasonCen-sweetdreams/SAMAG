This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for dynamic task allocation in IoT networks. We propose a novel algorithm, 'DMA-RL', which enables agents to learn and adapt to changing network conditions and task requirements in real-time. DMA-RL utilizes a decentralized actor-critic architecture, where agents communicate with their neighbors to share knowledge and coordinate their actions. Experimental results on a simulation platform demonstrate that DMA-RL outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion rate, latency, and energy efficiency.
