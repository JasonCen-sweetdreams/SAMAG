Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but their complexity and assumptions of high literacy levels often exclude marginalized populations. This paper presents a framework for designing inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to low-literacy users. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving user interviews, usability testing, and cognitive walkthroughs to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our results inform the development of a set of design guidelines and a prototype interface that leverages multimedia, simplification, and error tolerance to facilitate more accessible human-computer interaction. A pilot study with low-literacy participants demonstrates improved interaction outcomes and user satisfaction.
