Effective task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, but traditional methods often rely on manual tuning or simplistic heuristics. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to coordinate agents and optimize task assignments. Our framework, 'MASTA', uses a decentralized, multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to adapt to dynamic task requirements and agent capabilities. We evaluate MASTA in a simulated logistics scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced agent idle time compared to baseline methods. The results have implications for real-world applications, such as warehouse management and disaster response.
