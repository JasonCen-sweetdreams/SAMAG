This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework for autonomous agents using reinforcement learning. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized Markov decision process, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on its local observations and communication with neighboring agents. Our approach leverages a multi-agent deep Q-network to learn a decentralized policy that adapts to dynamic task arrivals and agent failures. Experimental results on a simulated robot swarm scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and system robustness.
