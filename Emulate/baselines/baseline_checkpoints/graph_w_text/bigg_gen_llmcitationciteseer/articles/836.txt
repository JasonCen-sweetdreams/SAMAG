Query-dependent document expansion is a crucial step in many information retrieval systems. Existing methods rely on static word embeddings, which may not capture the nuanced relationships between query terms and document content. We propose a novel approach that leverages contextualized embeddings, specifically designed to incorporate query-dependent semantics. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for verbose queries. We also show that our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing retrieval frameworks, making it a practical solution for real-world IR systems.
