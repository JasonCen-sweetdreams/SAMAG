Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks, but they often lack robustness to out-of-distribution inputs and neglect aleatoric uncertainty. This paper proposes a Bayesian neural network (BNN) framework that leverages sparse Gaussian processes to model uncertainty in neural network weights. We introduce a novel Variational Bayes-based inference method that enables efficient and scalable uncertainty estimation. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our approach improves classification accuracy and provides calibrated uncertainty estimates, outperforming state-of-the-art deterministic and Bayesian models.
