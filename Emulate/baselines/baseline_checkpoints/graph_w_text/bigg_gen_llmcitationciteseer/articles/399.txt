Multi-tenant database systems pose significant query optimization challenges due to the variability in workload patterns and resource constraints. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for multi-tenant databases. Our proposed framework, 'QTune', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that adapts to changing workload conditions and resource availability. Experimental results on a real-world database workload demonstrate that QTune outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
