With the increasing adoption of cloud-native databases, efficient query optimization is crucial for achieving low latency and high throughput. This paper tackles the join ordering problem in distributed query optimization, which is NP-hard and critical for query performance. We propose a novel, adaptive join ordering algorithm, 'DJOS', that leverages machine learning models to predict join selectivities and dynamically adjusts the join order based on runtime statistics. Our experiments on a real-world cloud-native database show that DJOS outperforms state-of-the-art join ordering algorithms by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
