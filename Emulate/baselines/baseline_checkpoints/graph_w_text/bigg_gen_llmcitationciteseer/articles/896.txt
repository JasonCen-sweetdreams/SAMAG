Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults, but current systems often struggle to accurately recognize gestures from this demographic. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing a gesture recognition system that is inclusive of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify key design requirements and developed a novel gesture recognition algorithm that incorporates age-related factors such as reduced dexterity and flexibility. Our evaluation results show that our system achieves a 25% improvement in gesture recognition accuracy compared to existing systems, with high user satisfaction and engagement.
