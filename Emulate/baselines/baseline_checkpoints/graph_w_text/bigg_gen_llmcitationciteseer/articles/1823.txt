Internet of Things (IoT) devices often have limited computing resources, making it challenging to deploy complex machine learning models. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian neural network (BNN) framework, 'LightBayes', which leverages probabilistic uncertainty estimation to reduce computational overhead. By incorporating a sparse, hierarchical prior distribution, LightBayes achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while requiring significantly fewer parameters and computations compared to traditional BNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of deploying LightBayes on resource-constrained IoT devices, enabling real-time inference and decision-making in various applications.
