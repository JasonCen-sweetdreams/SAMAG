Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in DDS, as it directly affects the performance and efficiency of data retrieval. This paper proposes a novel query optimization technique, 'Distributed Query Rewriter' (DQR), which leverages statistical modeling and machine learning to identify optimal query execution plans. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DQR through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, showcasing significant improvements in query response times and resource utilization compared to existing query optimization methods.
