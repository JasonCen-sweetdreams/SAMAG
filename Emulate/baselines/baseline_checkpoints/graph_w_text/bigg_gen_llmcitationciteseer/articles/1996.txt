Traditional ranking models in Information Retrieval (IR) rely on hand-crafted features and shallow models, which struggle to capture complex query-document interactions. This paper presents a novel deep ranking framework, 'DeepInteract', which leverages transformer-based architectures to model query-document interactions. We propose a multi-task learning approach that jointly optimizes ranking, relevance, and semantic matching objectives. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepInteract outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness to query variations.
