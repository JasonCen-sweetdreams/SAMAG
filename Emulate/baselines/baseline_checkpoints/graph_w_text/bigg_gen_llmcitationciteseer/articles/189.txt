Multimodal dialogue systems, which combine speech, text, and vision, have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction. However, the design of effective visualizations for these systems remains an open challenge. This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive visualization in multimodal dialogue systems, which leverages machine learning to dynamically adjust the visualization strategy based on the user's preferences, goals, and interaction history. We evaluate our approach through a user study and demonstrate improved user engagement, task performance, and overall experience.
