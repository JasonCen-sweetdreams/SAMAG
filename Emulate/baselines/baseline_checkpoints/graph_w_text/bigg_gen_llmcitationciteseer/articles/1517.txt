Session-based search has become increasingly popular, but it poses significant challenges for query understanding and document ranking. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs). Our model captures complex query-document relationships by hierarchically aggregating node representations from a graph constructed from the session history. We introduce a new attention mechanism that adaptively weights the importance of each query term based on its context and relevance to the search session. Experimental results on the TREC Session Track dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and nDCG.
