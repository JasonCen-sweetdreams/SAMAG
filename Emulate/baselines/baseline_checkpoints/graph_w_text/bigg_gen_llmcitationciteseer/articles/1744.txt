Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of users with cognitive or motor impairments. This paper presents a user-centered study investigating the impact of cognitive load on error recovery in voice-based interactions. We designed and evaluated three error recovery strategies: explicit correction, implicit correction, and adaptive feedback. Our results show that users with higher cognitive load benefit from explicit correction, while users with lower cognitive load prefer implicit correction. Adaptive feedback, which dynamically adjusts to user performance, improves overall user experience and error recovery rates. We provide design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants that accommodate diverse user needs.
