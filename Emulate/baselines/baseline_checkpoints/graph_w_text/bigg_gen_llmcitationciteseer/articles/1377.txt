The increasing adoption of RDF data has led to a surge in massive graph datasets, posing significant challenges for query optimization. This paper presents a novel parallel hash-based join algorithm, 'RDFJoin', designed to efficiently process complex queries on massive RDF graphs. RDFJoin leverages a distributed indexing strategy and a lock-free hash table to minimize synchronization overhead and optimize join operations. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that RDFJoin outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time and scalability.
