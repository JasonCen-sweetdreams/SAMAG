This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the impact of gestural interfaces on user experience and performance. We designed a VR system that incorporates hand-tracking and full-body motion capture, allowing participants to engage with virtual objects in a more immersive and intuitive manner. Our user study reveals that embodied cognition principles can significantly enhance user engagement, spatial awareness, and cognitive load reduction in VR applications. We also identify key design implications for VR systems that leverage gestural interfaces to support more natural and effective human-computer interaction.
