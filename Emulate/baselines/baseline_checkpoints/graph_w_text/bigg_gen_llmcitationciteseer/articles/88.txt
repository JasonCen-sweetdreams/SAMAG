Distributed database systems (DDS) often struggle with query optimization due to the complexity of data distribution and network latency. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'KG-Opt', which leverages knowledge graph embeddings to improve query performance in DDS. We embed database schemas and query graphs into a shared vector space, enabling the capture of semantic relationships between data entities. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrate that KG-Opt achieves up to 30% reduction in query latency and 25% improvement in query throughput compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
