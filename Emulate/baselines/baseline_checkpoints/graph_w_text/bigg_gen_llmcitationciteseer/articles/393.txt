In multi-agent systems, dynamic role assignment can significantly improve coordination and adaptability in the face of changing environmental conditions. This paper presents a novel approach to role assignment, using a hybrid of machine learning and optimization techniques. Our algorithm, 'DyRA', leverages graph neural networks to learn role representations and a genetic algorithm to optimize role assignments. We evaluate DyRA in a series of simulations, demonstrating improved system performance and robustness compared to existing role assignment methods. The proposed approach has applications in various domains, including robotics, smart cities, and disaster response.
