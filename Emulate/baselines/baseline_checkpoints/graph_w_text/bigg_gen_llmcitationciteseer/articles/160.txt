In multi-agent systems, agents often possess incomplete information about their environment and other agents' beliefs. This paper introduces a novel scoped belief revision framework that enables agents to revise their beliefs in response to new information while respecting the boundaries of their knowledge. Our approach leverages a probabilistic ontology to model incomplete information and incorporates a negotiation mechanism to resolve conflicts between agents' beliefs. We evaluate our framework in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving coordination and decision-making among agents with incomplete information.
