In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to allocate tasks among autonomous agents. We introduce a novel DCOP-based algorithm that leverages local negotiation and conflict resolution to find near-optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms centralized methods in terms of scalability, flexibility, and adaptability to dynamic task environments.
