As data warehouses continue to grow in size and complexity, traditional query optimization techniques struggle to keep up. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, called 'QOptRL', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given workload, taking into account various factors such as data distribution, indexing, and system resource utilization. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that QOptRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of execution time, while also adapting to changing workloads and system configurations.
