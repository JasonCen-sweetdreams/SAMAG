This paper presents a participatory design approach to developing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) for elderly healthcare. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with elderly individuals, caregivers, and healthcare professionals to identify key design requirements for ECAs that can effectively support elderly care. Our findings highlight the importance of emotional expression, empathy, and conversational naturalness in ECAs. We propose a novel ECA framework that incorporates these design requirements and demonstrate its feasibility through a prototype implementation. Our study contributes to the development of socially intelligent ECAs that can improve healthcare outcomes and quality of life for the elderly.
