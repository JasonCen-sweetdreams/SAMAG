The proliferation of IoT devices has generated an exponential increase in sensor data, making real-time anomaly detection a critical task. This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework, 'IoTAD', which leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to identify anomalies in high-dimensional, high-frequency IoT sensor streams. Our approach incorporates a transfer learning mechanism that adapts to new devices and environments, thereby reducing the need for extensive retraining. Experimental evaluations on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that IoTAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and latency.
