E-commerce search engines rely on query expansion to improve retrieval performance. Traditional methods employ handcrafted rules or statistical models, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal. We propose 'NeuroXE', a novel neural query expansion framework that leverages pre-trained language models to generate semantically coherent expansion terms. NeuroXE integrates a neural embeddings-based query representation with a probabilistic scoring function, enabling efficient and effective expansion. Our experiments on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in recall and precision over state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computational overhead.
