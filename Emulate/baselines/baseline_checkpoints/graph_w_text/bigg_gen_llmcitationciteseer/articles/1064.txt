This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating autonomous agents in smart traffic management systems using multi-objective reinforcement learning. Our framework, 'TrafficMA', integrates multiple agents with diverse objectives, such as minimizing travel time, reducing congestion, and prioritizing emergency vehicles. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture that balances individual agent objectives while ensuring global system optimality. Experimental results using a simulated traffic network demonstrate that TrafficMA outperforms traditional traffic signal control methods, reducing average travel time by 23% and decreasing congestion by 17%.
