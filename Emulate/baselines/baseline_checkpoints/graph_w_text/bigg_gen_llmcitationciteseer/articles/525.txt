This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using auction-based mechanisms. We propose a novel auction protocol that enables agents to bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. Our approach ensures efficient task allocation while minimizing communication overhead and promoting fairness among agents. We evaluate our framework through simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness in scenarios involving heterogeneous agents and varying task complexities.
