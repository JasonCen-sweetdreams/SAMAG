Decentralized coordination of autonomous vehicles is crucial for efficient traffic flow and road safety. This paper proposes a novel approach based on decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs) to coordinate autonomous vehicles at intersections. We develop a distributed algorithm that enables vehicles to make decisions based on local observations and communication with neighboring vehicles. Our approach is evaluated in a simulated environment, demonstrating improved traffic throughput and reduced collision rates compared to traditional centralized approaches. The proposed framework is scalable and can be applied to various urban traffic scenarios.
