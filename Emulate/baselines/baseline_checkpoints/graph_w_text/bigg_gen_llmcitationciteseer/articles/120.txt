This study explores the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) learning environments. We designed an immersive VR platform that integrates gestural interfaces and spatial awareness to facilitate deeper understanding of complex concepts in physics education. Our user study with 120 participants shows significant improvements in knowledge retention and transfer compared to traditional desktop-based learning. We also analyze the impact of embodiment on user engagement, cognitive load, and emotional experience. The results provide insights into the design of effective VR-based learning systems that leverage the strengths of embodied cognition.
