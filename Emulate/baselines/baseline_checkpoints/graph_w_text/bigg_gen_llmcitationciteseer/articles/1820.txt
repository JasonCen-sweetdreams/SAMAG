Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to efficiently optimize queries in distributed graph databases. Our method, called GNN-Opt, learns to predict the optimal query plan based on the graph structure and query characteristics. We evaluate GNN-Opt on a variety of graph datasets and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
