Knowledge graphs have become a crucial component in various AI applications, but their complex structures and multiple relationships pose significant challenges for effective representation learning. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that captures multi-relational knowledge graph embeddings. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant entities and relations, and a graph convolutional layer to capture local and global structural information. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in knowledge graph completion, entity classification, and question answering tasks.
