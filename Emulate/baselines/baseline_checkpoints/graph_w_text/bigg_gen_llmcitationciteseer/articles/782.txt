Traditional query expansion methods rely on term co-occurrence analysis, which can be ineffective in capturing nuanced semantic relationships. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepHash', which leverages deep semantic hashing to encode query terms and documents into a compact binary representation. By learning a non-linear transformation of the term-document matrix, DeepHash enables efficient retrieval of semantically similar documents. Experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that DeepHash outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision and recall, while reducing the index size by an order of magnitude.
