Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework that incorporates audio and tactile cues to enable visually impaired users to navigate and interact with virtual environments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and evaluated the effectiveness of our approach in terms of task completion time, accuracy, and user satisfaction. The results show that our framework significantly improves the VR experience for users with visual impairments, paving the way for more inclusive VR applications.
