Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) has become a de facto standard in modern distributed databases. However, query optimization in MVCC systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexities of version management and concurrency control. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MVCC-Opt', that leverages a probabilistic cost model to efficiently explore the search space of possible query plans. We introduce a set of novel optimization techniques, including version-aware index selection and adaptive sampling, to minimize the overhead of MVCC while maintaining high transactional throughput. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that MVCC-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in MVCC environments.
