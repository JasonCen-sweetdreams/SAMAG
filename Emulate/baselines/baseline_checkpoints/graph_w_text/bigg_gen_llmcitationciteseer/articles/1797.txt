Gesture-based interaction is a crucial aspect of Virtual Reality (VR) systems, but its impact on user experience and performance is not yet fully understood. This study investigates the effects of gesture complexity, feedback type, and user expertise on task completion time, error rate, and subjective user experience in a VR environment. Our results show that users with prior VR experience exhibit improved performance and higher satisfaction with gestures that provide haptic feedback, whereas novices benefit from simpler gestures with visual feedback. The findings inform the design of more intuitive and effective gesture-based interfaces for VR applications.
