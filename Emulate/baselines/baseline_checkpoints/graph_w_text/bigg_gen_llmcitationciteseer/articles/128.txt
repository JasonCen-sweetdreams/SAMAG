Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. Traditional methods often struggle to handle high-dimensional data and fail to capture complex relationships between variables. This paper proposes a novel graph-based attention mechanism, 'GAT-AD', which models temporal dependencies and correlations in time series data. We leverage graph attention networks to learn node representations and detect anomalies in real-time. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GAT-AD over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
