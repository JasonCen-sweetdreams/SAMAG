Real-time traffic signal control is a complex problem that requires adaptability to dynamic traffic conditions. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'SmartSignal', which enables decentralized control of traffic signals. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that combines local agents with a central coordinator, allowing for real-time optimization of traffic flow. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model complex traffic patterns and incorporates domain knowledge to ensure safety and efficiency. Experimental results on a large-scale traffic simulator demonstrate significant improvements in traffic throughput and reductions in congestion.
