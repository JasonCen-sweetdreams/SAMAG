Explainable recommendation systems have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to increase user trust and transparency. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that generates personalized explanations for recommended items. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex item relationships and incorporates hierarchical pooling to selectively focus on relevant features. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
