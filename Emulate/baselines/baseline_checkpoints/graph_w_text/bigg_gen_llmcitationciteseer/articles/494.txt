Ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) faces a long-standing challenge of inadequate query representations, leading to poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQE', that leverages deep neural networks to learn query expansion strategies. We design a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query representation, term weighting, and relevance ranking. Experimental results on standard IR benchmarks demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
