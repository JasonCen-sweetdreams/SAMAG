Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing personalized support and companionship to patients. However, the effectiveness of ECAs depends on patients' trust and emotional connection with these agents. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an ECA for healthcare, focusing on trust-building strategies and emotional intelligence. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 patients and 15 healthcare professionals, revealing that ECAs with empathetic responses and nonverbal cues can establish higher trust and emotional connection with patients. Our findings provide insights into the design of ECAs that can improve patient engagement and outcomes in healthcare settings.
