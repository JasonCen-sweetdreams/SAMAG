In cloud computing, efficient resource allocation is crucial for optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) and reducing costs. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, 'CloudAllocator', which learns to allocate resources in real-time based on dynamic workload patterns. We utilize a hybrid architecture combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world cloud dataset demonstrate that CloudAllocator outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods in terms of QoS satisfaction, resource utilization, and cost reduction.
