Reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) with multi-hop dependencies is a challenging task, as it requires capturing complex semantic relationships between entities. We propose a novel approach, HierAttnKG, which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant KG components during inference. Our method learns efficient entity and relation embeddings by jointly optimizing a knowledge graph embedding objective and a hierarchical attention objective. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that HierAttnKG outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multi-hop reasoning tasks, while reducing the number of parameters and inference time.
