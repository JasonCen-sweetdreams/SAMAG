AUTOSIG, a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, is presented to autonomously control traffic signals in real-time. AUTOSIG leverages a decentralized actor-critic architecture, where each agent learns to optimize signal timings based on local traffic conditions and communicates with neighboring agents to minimize congestion. We propose a novel graph attention mechanism to efficiently handle high-dimensional state spaces and demonstrate significant reductions in travel times and queues compared to traditional TCP/IP and state-of-the-art MARL methods. AUTOSIG is evaluated on a large-scale traffic simulator, showcasing its scalability and adaptability to diverse traffic scenarios.
