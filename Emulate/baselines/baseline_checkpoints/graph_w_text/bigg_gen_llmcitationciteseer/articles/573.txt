Virtual reality (VR) systems have revolutionized interactive experiences, but existing interaction modalities often rely on explicit user input. This paper presents a novel gaze-based adaptive interaction framework for VR environments, leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques. Our approach predicts user intentions from gaze patterns and adapts the interaction modality accordingly, enhancing overall user experience and reducing cognitive load. We evaluate our framework through a user study, demonstrating significant improvements in interaction efficiency and user satisfaction.
