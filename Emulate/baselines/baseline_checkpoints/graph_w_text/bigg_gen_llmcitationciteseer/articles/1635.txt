Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) framework, which incorporates both item-level and user-level attention mechanisms to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model complex relationships between users and items, and hierarchical attention to selectively focus on relevant features. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art ERS models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
