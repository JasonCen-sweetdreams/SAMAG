Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities must collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper introduces HAGNET, a novel hierarchical attentional graph neural network architecture for efficient task allocation. HAGNET learns to represent agents, tasks, and their relationships as a hierarchical graph, and uses attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant information when making allocation decisions. Experimental results on a range of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that HAGNET outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and robustness to agent failures.
