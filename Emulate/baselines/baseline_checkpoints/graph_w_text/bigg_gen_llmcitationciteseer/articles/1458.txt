Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence, but existing indexing techniques struggle to handle the high-dimensional and dynamic nature of contemporary datasets. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'SkyIndex', which leverages multi-dimensional SKYLINES to efficiently process range queries and aggregations. By exploiting the inherent structure of SKYLINES, SkyIndex achieves superior query performance and scalability compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods. Experimental results on a real-world financial dataset demonstrate that SkyIndex reduces query latency by up to 5x and improves data freshness by up to 3x.
