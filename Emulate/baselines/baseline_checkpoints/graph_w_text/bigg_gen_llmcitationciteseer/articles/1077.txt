Modern information retrieval systems rely on neural ranking models to accurately rank documents for user queries. However, these models can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well to unseen queries. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive neural ranking model, 'QNRM', which leverages query semantics to dynamically adjust the ranking model's weights. We demonstrate that QNRM achieves significant improvements in ranking accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models, particularly for tail queries. Experiments on the TREC Web Track dataset show that QNRM reduces the average ranking time by 30% while maintaining a 10% increase in NDCG@10.
