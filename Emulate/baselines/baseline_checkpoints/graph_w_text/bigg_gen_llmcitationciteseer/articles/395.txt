Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require robust control policies to navigate complex scenarios, including uncertain weather conditions. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'Weather Aware Control' (WAC), which learns to adapt to varying weather conditions (rain, snow, fog) using a novel weather-aware reward function. WAC leverages a combination of sensor modalities (camera, lidar, radar) and weather forecasts to learn a robust policy. Experimental results demonstrate that WAC outperforms traditional model-based control methods in simulated and real-world scenarios, ensuring safe and efficient navigation under adverse weather conditions.
