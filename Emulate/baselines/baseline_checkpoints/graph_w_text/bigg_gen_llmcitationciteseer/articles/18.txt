Real-time analytics on distributed databases poses significant scalability challenges due to the complexities of query optimization. This paper presents 'DynaOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning to predict query execution plans and adapt to dynamic workload changes. DynaOpt integrates a graph neural network-based cost estimator with a reinforcement learning-driven plan enumerator, enabling efficient exploration of the plan space. Experimental results on a 100-node distributed database cluster demonstrate that DynaOpt achieves an average speedup of 3.2x over state-of-the-art optimization techniques for real-time analytics workloads.
