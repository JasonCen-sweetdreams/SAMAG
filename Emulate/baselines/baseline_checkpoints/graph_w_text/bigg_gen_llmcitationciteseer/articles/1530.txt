This paper presents a participatory design approach to creating tangible interfaces for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). We collaborated with children with ASD, their caregivers, and clinicians to co-design a set of interactive, modular blocks that facilitate social skills training and emotional regulation. Our user study with 20 children with ASD shows that the tangible interface significantly improved their engagement and ability to recognize and express emotions, compared to traditional screen-based interventions. We contribute a design framework for tangible interfaces that prioritize the needs and preferences of children with ASD, and discuss implications for future HCI research in this area.
