Distributed database systems (DDBS) with heterogeneous storage (e.g., HDD, SSD, and flash) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data workloads efficiently. However, query optimization in such systems is a complex task due to the varying storage access patterns and speeds. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'HeteroOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and adaptive plan optimization to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. Our experimental results on a real-world DDBS setup show that HeteroOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query response time.
