Neural search engines have shown promising results in retrieval tasks, but their performance heavily relies on the quality of query representations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'GraphEmb', which leverages graph-based keyword embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms. Our approach first constructs a keyword graph using co-occurrence statistics and then applies graph convolutional networks to learn dense embeddings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphEmb significantly improves the retrieval performance of neural search engines, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
