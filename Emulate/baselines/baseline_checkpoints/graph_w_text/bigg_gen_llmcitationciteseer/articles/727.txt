The growing scale of RDF datasets poses significant challenges for query performance. Traditional indexing techniques often struggle to efficiently handle the complex, graph-structured data inherent in RDF. This paper introduces 'LIX', a novel learned index structure that leverages machine learning models to optimize query execution. By learning the underlying data distribution and query patterns, LIX achieves significant reductions in query latency and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of LIX in improving query performance and scalability.
