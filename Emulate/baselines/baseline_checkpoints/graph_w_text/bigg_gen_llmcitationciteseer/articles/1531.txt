The increasing complexity of modern database systems has led to a growing need for efficient query optimization techniques. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization that leverages the capabilities of heterogeneous processing units (HPUs) in distributed database systems. Our framework, 'HPU-Opt', utilizes a combination of CPU, GPU, and FPGA accelerators to execute query operators in a manner that minimizes execution time and energy consumption. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HPU-Opt achieves an average speedup of 3.2x over traditional CPU-based query optimization techniques, while reducing energy consumption by up to 45%.
