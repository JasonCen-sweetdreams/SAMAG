E-commerce search engines often struggle to accurately capture user intent due to the complexity of natural language queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages aspect-based sentiment analysis to identify relevant product features and sentiment polarities. Our approach integrates a deep learning-based sentiment analyzer with a probabilistic query expansion framework, resulting in improved retrieval accuracy and diversity. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant gains in precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
