With the exponential growth of digital documents, efficient and accurate document retrieval has become a pressing need. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Neural Ranking Model (HNR) that leverages the strengths of both neural networks and traditional ranking models. HNR utilizes a hierarchical architecture to capture both local and global context, enabling more accurate document ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNR outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, while also providing insights into the importance of document structure in ranking.
