This paper presents a novel decentralized approach to coalition formation for task-oriented autonomous agents. We propose a multi-agent framework, 'TaskForge', that enables agents to self-organize into coalitions to accomplish complex tasks in dynamic environments. TaskForge integrates a distributed constraint optimization algorithm with a probabilistic task allocation mechanism, ensuring efficient and adaptive coalition formation. Experimental results in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of TaskForge in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead compared to centralized coalition formation methods.
