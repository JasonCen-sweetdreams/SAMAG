In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). Our approach, called Hierarchical Task Allocator (HTA), consists of a high-level coordinator that sets task priorities and a low-level scheduler that assigns tasks to individual agents. HTA is trained using a hierarchical reward function that balances task completion with agent utilities. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HTA outperforms traditional decentralized approaches in terms of task completion time and agent satisfaction.
