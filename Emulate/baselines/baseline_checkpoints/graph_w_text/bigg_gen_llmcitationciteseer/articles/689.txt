Temporal graphs are increasingly used to model dynamic relationships in various domains, such as social networks, traffic patterns, and financial transactions. Real-time analytics on these graphs requires efficient indexing mechanisms to support fast query processing. This paper presents 'TG-Index', a novel indexing framework that leverages graph summarization and tiered indexing to enable scalable and efficient query processing on large temporal graphs. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that TG-Index outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 5x in terms of query response time and 3x in terms of storage efficiency.
