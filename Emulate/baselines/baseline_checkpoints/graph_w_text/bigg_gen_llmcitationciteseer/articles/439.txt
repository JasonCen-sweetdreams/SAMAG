Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years. However, most existing methods rely on feature attribution or model-based explanations, which may not fully capture the complex relationships between users and items. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) model for recommendation systems. HAGNN learns to represent users and items as hierarchical graphs, incorporating both local and global dependencies. We introduce a novel attention mechanism that adaptively weights the importance of different graph layers and nodes. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
