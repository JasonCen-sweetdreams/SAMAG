Virtual reality (VR) has seen significant advancements in recent years, but the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience remains understudied. This paper investigates the effects of vibrotactile feedback on user satisfaction, presence, and performance in VR. We designed a series of experiments using a custom-built VR setup, incorporating a vibrotactile feedback system. Our results show that vibrotactile feedback significantly improves user experience, particularly in tasks requiring fine motor skills. We also identify key factors influencing user perception of vibrotactile feedback, including device type, vibration frequency, and individual differences in haptic sensitivity.
