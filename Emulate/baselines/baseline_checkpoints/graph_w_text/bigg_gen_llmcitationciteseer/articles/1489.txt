Traditional information retrieval systems often neglect the semantic relationships between documents and their contextual information. This paper proposes a novel context-aware document retrieval framework, 'HierDoc', which leverages hierarchical graph convolutional networks (HGCNs) to model document structures and capture contextual dependencies. Our approach incorporates node-wise attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant contextual features, enabling more accurate retrieval results. Experimental evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HierDoc in improving retrieval performance, especially for complex queries and long documents.
