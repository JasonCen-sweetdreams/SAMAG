Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to enrich the original query with relevant terms to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel neural-based approach, 'NDE-QE', which leverages document embeddings to generate expansion terms. We employ a deep neural network to learn dense vector representations of documents, capturing semantic relationships between terms and documents. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NDE-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, yielding significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
