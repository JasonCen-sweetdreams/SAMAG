Virtual reality (VR) systems often rely on visual and auditory cues to provide users with feedback. However, these modalities can be limited in their ability to convey information in complex, dynamic environments. This study explores the use of vibrotactile feedback to enhance gesture recognition in VR. We conducted a user study with 24 participants, comparing the performance of a gesture recognition system with and without vibrotactile feedback. Our results show that the addition of vibrotactile feedback significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and reduces user error. Furthermore, we found that users reported higher levels of immersion and engagement when vibrotactile feedback was present.
