Conversational search systems aim to retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. However, the ambiguity and nuances of natural language queries pose significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel deep query expansion approach, 'Converse-QE', which leverages hierarchical transformers to model both local and global contextual relationships in user queries. Our approach incorporates a semantic role labeling module to identify key entities and their relationships, enabling more accurate query expansion. Experimental results on the TREC Conversational Assistant Track dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, especially for complex, multi-turn conversations.
