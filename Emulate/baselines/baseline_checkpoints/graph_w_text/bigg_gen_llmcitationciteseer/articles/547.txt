Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR environment using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited increased engagement, measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported feedback. We also found that personalized avatars led to higher levels of presence and immersion. The implications of this research have significant potential for enhancing user experience in VR-based applications.
