This paper presents a novel human-centric approach to adaptive notification systems, which leverages user behavior, context, and preferences to optimize notification timing and content. Our system, 'NotiFit', incorporates machine learning-based user modeling and real-time sensor data to personalize notifications, reducing distractions and improving user engagement. A 6-week user study with 100 participants demonstrates that NotiFit increases notification response rates by 35% and reduces perceived annoyance by 27% compared to traditional notification systems. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more human-centered and effective notification systems.
