Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing approach that dynamically adjusts to changing query workloads and data distributions. Our method, called 'AIQ', leverages machine learning-based predictions to identify optimal index configurations and incrementally updates the index structure. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AIQ outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while reducing storage overhead by up to 25%
