Cooperative task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines reinforcement learning with attention-based communication. Our method, called MARL-ATC, enables agents to learn effective communication strategies and allocate tasks cooperatively. We evaluate MARL-ATC on a series of simulated scenarios and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and team rewards compared to existing methods. The attention mechanism is shown to be crucial in facilitating effective communication and adapting to changing environmental conditions.
