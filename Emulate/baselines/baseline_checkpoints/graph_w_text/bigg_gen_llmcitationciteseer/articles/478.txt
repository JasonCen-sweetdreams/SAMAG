This study investigates the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to reduce cognitive load for elderly users interacting with complex interfaces. We designed an ECA-based system that provides personalized assistance and feedback to users navigating a healthcare portal. Our user study with 30 elderly participants shows that the ECA condition resulted in significantly lower cognitive load, improved task completion rates, and higher user satisfaction compared to a text-based interface. We also analyzed the impact of ECA embodiment, voice, and gestures on user experience and found that a combination of these factors contributes to the observed benefits.
