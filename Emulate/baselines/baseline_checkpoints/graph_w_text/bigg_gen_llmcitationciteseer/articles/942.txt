The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of sensor data, necessitating efficient query optimization techniques for real-time analytics. This paper proposes 'SenseOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages statistical modeling and machine learning to predict query execution times. SenseOpt integrates a cost-based optimizer with a learning-based cardinality estimator, enabling accurate query planning and efficient resource allocation. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that SenseOpt achieves up to 3x faster query execution times compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
