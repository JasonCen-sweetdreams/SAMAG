Column-store databases have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to efficiently store and query large amounts of data. However, supporting multi-dimensional range queries remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, called 'RangeCube', which leverages a combination of space-filling curves and hierarchical clustering to efficiently prune the search space. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that RangeCube outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query performance and 2x in terms of storage efficiency.
