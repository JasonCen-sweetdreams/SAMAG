Coordinating multiple agents in complex tasks is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel approach that combines hierarchical task decomposition with reinforcement learning to enable efficient and effective coordination. Our method, called HTR-RL, decomposes tasks into sub-tasks and allocates them to agents based on their capabilities. The agents learn to coordinate through reinforcement learning, receiving rewards for successful task completion. We evaluate HTR-RL in a simulated robotic soccer domain and demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods.
