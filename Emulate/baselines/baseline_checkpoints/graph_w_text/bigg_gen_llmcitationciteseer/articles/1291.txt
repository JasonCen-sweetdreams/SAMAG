Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in node classification tasks, but their performance degrades significantly in few-shot settings. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, 'HAT-GNN', which leverages both node and graph-level attention mechanisms to adaptively select the most informative nodes and subgraphs for few-shot learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAT-GNN on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-shot node classification tasks while requiring minimal labeled data.
