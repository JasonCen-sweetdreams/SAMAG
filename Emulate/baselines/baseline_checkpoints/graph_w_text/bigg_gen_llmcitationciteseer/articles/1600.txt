Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it helps to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem between queries and documents. However, existing query expansion methods often rely on Euclidean embeddings, which may not effectively capture the complex semantic relationships between words. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion approach using hyperbolic embeddings, which can better model hierarchical and asymmetric relationships. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving up to 15% improvement in retrieval performance.
