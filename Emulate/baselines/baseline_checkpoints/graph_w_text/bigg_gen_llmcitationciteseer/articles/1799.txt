Sparse retrieval models have gained popularity in information retrieval due to their efficiency and effectiveness. However, they often struggle with vocabulary mismatch, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepExp', which leverages deep neural networks to generate context-aware expansion terms. Our method utilizes a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture semantic relationships between query terms and the document collection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepExp significantly improves the retrieval performance of sparse models, outperforming traditional query expansion techniques.
