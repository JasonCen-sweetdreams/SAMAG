Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to query expansion, where the goal is to learn an optimal expansion policy that maximizes retrieval effectiveness. We propose a novel RL framework, 'QueryExRL', which leverages a combination of lexical and semantic features to guide the expansion process. Experimental results on the TREC Ad-Hoc dataset demonstrate that QueryExRL outperforms state-of-the-art expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
