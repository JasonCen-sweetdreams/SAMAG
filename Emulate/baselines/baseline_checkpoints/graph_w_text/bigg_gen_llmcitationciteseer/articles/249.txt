In multi-agent systems, trust and reputation play crucial roles in facilitating cooperation and mitigating malicious behavior. This paper presents a novel framework, 'AdapTrust', which integrates adaptive trust and reputation mechanisms to enhance the coordination of autonomous agents. AdapTrust leverages machine learning techniques to learn trust models from agent interactions and adapt to changing environmental conditions. We evaluate AdapTrust in a simulated smart grid scenario, demonstrating improved cooperation and reduced susceptibilities to manipulation attacks compared to existing trust-based approaches.
