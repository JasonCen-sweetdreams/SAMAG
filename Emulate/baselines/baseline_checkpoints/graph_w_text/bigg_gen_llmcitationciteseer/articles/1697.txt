Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly used in various applications, including autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and e-commerce platforms. However, the presence of deceptive agents can lead to catastrophic consequences. This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting deceptive behavior in MAS using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We design a GCN-based model that learns to identify patterns of deception in agent interactions, leveraging both structural and behavioral features of the agent graph. Experimental results on a synthetic MAS dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting deceptive agents, outperforming traditional machine learning methods.
