Ad-hoc search is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. However, the performance of ad-hoc search systems can be limited by the quality of the query. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. Our approach leverages the semantic relationships between words and phrases to generate expanded queries that better capture the user's intent. We evaluate our approach on several standard datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion methods. Our results show that the proposed approach can be effectively integrated into existing search systems to improve their overall performance.
