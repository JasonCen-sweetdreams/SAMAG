Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, query performance in DDS is often bottlenecked by inefficient index selection. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning (ML) to optimize index selection for DDS. We develop a decision-tree-based model that takes into account various query and dataset characteristics to predict the most effective index configuration. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrate that our ML-based approach achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional static indexing methods.
