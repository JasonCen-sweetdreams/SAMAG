In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach, 'GraphMA', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn scalable and adaptive task allocation policies. We model the agent-task interaction as a graph, where agents and tasks are nodes, and edges represent feasibility and desirability. Our GNN-based algorithm learns to optimize task assignments based on local and global graph features, outperforming traditional methods in terms of both allocation efficiency and solution quality. Experimental evaluations on various multi-agent scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of GraphMA.
