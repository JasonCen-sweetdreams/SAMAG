Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant texts for answer extraction. This paper presents HDRPR, a novel dense representation approach that leverages hierarchical contextualized embeddings to encode passages. By capturing multi-granular semantic relationships, HDRPR significantly reduces the dimensionality of passage representations while improving their discriminative power. Our experiments on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that HDRPR-based retrieval outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12.5% increase in top-1 passage accuracy and a 30% reduction in computational cost.
