Distributed databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data storage systems, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive query optimization framework, 'AQO-R', that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust query execution plans based on runtime statistics. We employ a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn an optimized query plan policy, which is trained on a simulated environment and fine-tuned on real-world workloads. Experimental results demonstrate that AQO-R outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
