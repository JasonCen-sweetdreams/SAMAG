This paper presents a novel agent-based task allocation framework for multi-robot systems, enabling efficient and adaptive task assignment in dynamic environments. Our approach leverages autonomous agents to negotiate and allocate tasks based on their capabilities, resource constraints, and real-time feedback from the environment. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in system efficiency and robustness compared to traditional centralized allocation methods, making our framework suitable for various real-world applications, including search and rescue operations and environmental monitoring.
