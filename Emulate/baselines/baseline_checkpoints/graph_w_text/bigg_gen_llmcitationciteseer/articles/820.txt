In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our method, called 'MATRL', leverages a decentralized DRL framework to enable agents to learn task allocation strategies in a scalable and flexible manner. We evaluate MATRL in a variety of simulated environments and demonstrate its ability to outperform traditional heuristic-based approaches in terms of task completion time and resource utilization. The results suggest that MATRL has significant potential for real-world applications in areas such as robotic swarm control and smart manufacturing.
