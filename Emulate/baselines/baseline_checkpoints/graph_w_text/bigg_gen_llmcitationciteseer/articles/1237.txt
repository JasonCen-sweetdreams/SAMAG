Short-text queries pose significant challenges for traditional information retrieval systems due to the scarcity of relevant terms. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural network (HNN) architecture that learns to represent short-text queries and documents in a shared semantic space. Our approach leverages a attention-based mechanism to selectively focus on relevant keywords and phrases in the query, and a hierarchical aggregation strategy to capture nuanced relationships between document sections. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HNN-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of retrieval precision and efficiency.
