This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'TrafficMA', designed for real-time traffic management in large-scale urban networks. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that combines centralized traffic signal control with decentralized agent-based decision-making. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model traffic dynamics and incorporates attention mechanisms to facilitate cooperation among agents. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate that TrafficMA achieves significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional traffic management strategies.
