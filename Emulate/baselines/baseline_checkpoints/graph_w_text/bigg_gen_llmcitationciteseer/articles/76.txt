Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained popularity in recent years due to the need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for ERS, which leverages both item-level and user-level attention mechanisms to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art ERS models on three benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in explanation quality and user satisfaction. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the learned attention patterns, offering insights into the decision-making process of the model.
