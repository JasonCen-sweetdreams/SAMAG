Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper introduces CAQE, a novel query reformulation approach that leverages context-aware embeddings to better capture query intent. Our method represents queries as dense vectors that incorporate semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic contextual features. We demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query reformulation techniques on several benchmark datasets, achieving improvements of up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
