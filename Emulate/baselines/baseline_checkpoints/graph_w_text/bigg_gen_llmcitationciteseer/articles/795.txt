Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. One of the key challenges in ad-hoc retrieval is the vocabulary mismatch problem, where the query terms do not appear in the relevant documents. Query expansion is a popular technique to address this issue. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion approach using deep neural networks. Our approach leverages the semantic relationships between words and phrases to generate effective expansion terms. We evaluate our approach on several standard datasets and show significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
