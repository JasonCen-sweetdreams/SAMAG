Main-memory databases have revolutionized query performance, but optimizing query workloads remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the application of learned index structures to improve query performance in main-memory databases. We propose a novel learned index framework, 'QuickIndex', which leverages machine learning models to predict and adapt to query patterns. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that QuickIndex achieves up to 3x performance improvement compared to traditional indexing techniques, while reducing index construction time by up to 50%. We also analyze the trade-offs between query performance, index maintenance, and model accuracy.
