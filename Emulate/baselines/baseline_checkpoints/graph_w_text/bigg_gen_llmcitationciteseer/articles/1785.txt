Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series data is a challenging task, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional and noisy data. In this paper, we propose a novel deep clustering approach, HATS, that leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to identify anomalous patterns. HATS consists of two modules: a hierarchical attention module that captures complex temporal dependencies and a clustering module that groups similar time series segments. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HATS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to noise.
