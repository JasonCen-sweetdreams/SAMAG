We propose a novel approach for distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our method, called GraphTask, leverages the structural properties of the agent communication graph to learn effective task assignments. By incorporating node and edge features, GraphTask can capture complex dependencies between agents and tasks, outperforming traditional methods based on greedy allocation and coalition formation. We evaluate our approach on a variety of scenarios, including robotic search and rescue, and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and overall system efficiency.
