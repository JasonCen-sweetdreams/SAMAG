This paper introduces a novel hierarchical neural ranking model for efficient document retrieval. Our approach leverages a multi-level representation of documents, where coarse-grained topic models are used to filter out irrelevant documents, followed by fine-grained neural ranking models to re-rank the remaining documents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different hierarchical structures on retrieval performance and provide insights for future research.
