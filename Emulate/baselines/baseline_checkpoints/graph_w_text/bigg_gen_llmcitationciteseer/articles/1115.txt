This paper presents a novel approach to document embeddings, tailored to efficient retrieval in high-dimensional spaces. Our method, dubbed 'QADE', adaptively updates document representations based on the query context, leveraging both local and global semantic relationships. By incorporating a hierarchical attention mechanism and a query-aware sampling strategy, QADE reduces the retrieval complexity while maintaining retrieval quality. Experimental evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.
