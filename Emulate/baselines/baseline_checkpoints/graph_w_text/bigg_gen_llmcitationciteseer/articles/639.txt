Time-series databases have become crucial for various applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, efficient query processing remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the benefits of tree-based and hash-based indexing techniques. Our approach, called 'TS-Hybrid', leverages the strengths of each indexing method to optimize query performance for different types of time-series queries. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TS-Hybrid outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3.5x for range queries and 2.2x for aggregation queries.
