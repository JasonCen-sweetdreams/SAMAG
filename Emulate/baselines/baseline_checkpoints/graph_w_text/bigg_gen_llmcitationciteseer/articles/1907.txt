Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a crucial component in various natural language processing and artificial intelligence applications. However, searching for semantic entities in large-scale KGs remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphAttENT', which leverages graph attention networks to efficiently retrieve semantic entities in KGs. GraphAttENT learns to focus on relevant nodes and edges in the graph, thereby reducing the search space and improving retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphAttENT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and query latency.
