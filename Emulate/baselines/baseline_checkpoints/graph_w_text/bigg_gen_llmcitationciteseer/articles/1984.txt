Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a key task in natural language processing, where the goal is to identify sentiment polarities towards specific aspects or entities in text. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture for ABSA, which leverages the graph structure of aspect-entity relationships to capture complex contextual dependencies. Our model consists of two stages: (1) aspect extraction using a graph attention mechanism, and (2) sentiment prediction via a hierarchical graph neural network. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of aspect extraction F1-score and sentiment accuracy, achieving a new state-of-the-art on the SemEval 2014 dataset.
