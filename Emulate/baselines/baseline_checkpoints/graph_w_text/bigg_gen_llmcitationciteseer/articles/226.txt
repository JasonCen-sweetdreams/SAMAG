This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroXPand', which leverages neural semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and documents. By integrating a pre-trained language model with a graph-based ranking algorithm, NeuroXPand generates more informative and diverse expansion terms, leading to significant improvements in ad-hoc retrieval performance. Experiments on several TREC benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuroXPand, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
