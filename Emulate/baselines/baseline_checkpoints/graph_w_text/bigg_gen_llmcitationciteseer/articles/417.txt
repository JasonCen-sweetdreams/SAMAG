Document ranking is a crucial component of modern information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel proximity-aware document ranking model, 'GraphRank', which leverages hierarchical graph neural networks to capture complex relationships between query terms and document structures. By incorporating proximity features into the graph representation, GraphRank can effectively model term dependencies and contextual relevance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ranking performance compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
