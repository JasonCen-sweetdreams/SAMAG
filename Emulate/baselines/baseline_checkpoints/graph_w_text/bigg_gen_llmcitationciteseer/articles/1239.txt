Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging problem in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short and ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel context-aware embedding approach, 'CAQE', which leverages query-term dependencies and document structures to improve query expansion. Our method incorporates a graph-based attention mechanism to capture semantic relationships between query terms and their surrounding context. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
