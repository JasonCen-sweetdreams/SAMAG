In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'RL-Allocator', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in dynamic environments. RL-Allocator uses a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture to learn both local and global reward functions, enabling agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Experimental results in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that RL-Allocator outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized allocation methods, achieving improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead.
