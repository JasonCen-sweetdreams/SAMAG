Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in data integration and cleaning for noisy databases. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted features or simple machine learning models, which struggle to capture complex relationships between entities. This paper proposes a novel graph-based neural network approach, 'GraphDisamb', which learns to represent entities as nodes in a graph and utilizes attention mechanisms to disambiguate entities based on their relationships. Our experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphDisamb outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability, even in the presence of high noise levels.
