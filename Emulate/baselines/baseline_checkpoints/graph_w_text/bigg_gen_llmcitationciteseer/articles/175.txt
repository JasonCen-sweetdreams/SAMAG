The increasing scale and complexity of IoT networks necessitate efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper presents a decentralized agent-based framework, 'IoT-Agent', which leverages autonomous agents to dynamically allocate resources and optimize network performance. IoT-Agent utilizes a distributed negotiation protocol to facilitate agent-to-agent communication, ensuring adaptability to changing network conditions. We evaluate IoT-Agent using a realistic simulation environment, demonstrating improved resource utilization and reduced latency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
