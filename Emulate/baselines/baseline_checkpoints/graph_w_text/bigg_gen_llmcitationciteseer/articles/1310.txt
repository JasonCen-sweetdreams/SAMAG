Accurate eye tracking is crucial for various applications in virtual reality (VR), including foveated rendering, gaze-based interaction, and user experience analysis. This paper presents EyeGazeTracker, a machine learning-based approach for real-time eye tracking in VR. Our system utilizes a deep neural network to predict gaze directions from eye images captured using a VR headset-mounted camera. We propose a novel data augmentation technique to increase the diversity of the training dataset, achieving a significant improvement in gaze estimation accuracy. Evaluations on a public VR eye tracking dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of EyeGazeTracker in terms of accuracy, latency, and robustness to varying lighting conditions.
