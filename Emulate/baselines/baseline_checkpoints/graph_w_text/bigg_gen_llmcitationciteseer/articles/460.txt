As distributed database systems become increasingly prevalent, ensuring data consistency in real-time applications has become a pressing concern. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) approach that leverages timestamp-based ordering and conflict resolution mechanisms to guarantee consistency across distributed nodes. Our approach, called RT-MVCC, is designed to minimize latency and improve throughput in real-time systems. Experimental results on a simulated real-time database workload demonstrate that RT-MVCC outperforms existing MVCC schemes in terms of both consistency and performance.
