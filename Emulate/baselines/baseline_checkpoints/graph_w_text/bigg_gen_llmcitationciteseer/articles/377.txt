Imbalanced datasets pose significant challenges to clustering algorithms, often leading to biased or inaccurate results. This paper introduces 'AdapCluster', a novel hierarchical clustering approach that leverages adaptive sampling to address class imbalance. By dynamically adjusting the sampling rate based on local density estimates, AdapCluster effectively reduces the impact of class imbalance and improves clustering quality. Experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of AdapCluster over existing methods, achieving improved precision and recall for minority classes.
