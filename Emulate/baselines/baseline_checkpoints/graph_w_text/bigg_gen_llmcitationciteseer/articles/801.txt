Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, existing methods often struggle with high-dimensional data and limited labeled anomalies. This paper proposes a novel graph-based contrastive learning approach, 'GraphCon', which learns to identify anomalies by contrasting the behavior of normal and abnormal samples in a graph-structured representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphCon on several real-world datasets, achieving significant improvements in detection accuracy and speed over state-of-the-art methods.
