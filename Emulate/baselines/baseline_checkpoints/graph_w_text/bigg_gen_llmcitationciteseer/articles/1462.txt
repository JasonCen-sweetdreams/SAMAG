Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel neural query graph (NQG) framework for efficient query expansion. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model query-term relationships and generates a robust set of expansion terms. We demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness on multiple benchmark datasets, including the TREC-8 and Robust-04 collections. Furthermore, our experiments show that NQG-based query expansion outperforms traditional methods in terms of computational efficiency and scalability.
