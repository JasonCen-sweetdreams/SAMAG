Cooperative agents in multi-agent systems often face the challenge of task allocation, where agents need to assign tasks to themselves and other agents to maximize overall system performance. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'CoopAllocator', enables agents to learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities, preferences, and environmental constraints. We conduct extensive experiments in a simulated robotics environment, demonstrating that CoopAllocator outperforms traditional centralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency.
