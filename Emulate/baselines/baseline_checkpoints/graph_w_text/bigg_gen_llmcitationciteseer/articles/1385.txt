The rapid growth of web data has led to an explosion in the number of documents searched by modern search engines. Query expansion techniques can improve retrieval effectiveness, but they often suffer from high computational costs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE', that leverages both semantic and syntactic features to generate relevant expansion terms. HQE uses a graph-based approach to model query-document relationships, allowing for efficient pruning of irrelevant terms and reduction of computational overhead. Experimental results on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
