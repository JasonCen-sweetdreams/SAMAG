Query optimization is a crucial component of modern database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and overall system efficiency. This paper explores the application of learned index structures to accelerate query optimization. We propose a novel approach, 'Liqo', which integrates machine learning models into the query optimization process to predict optimal query plans. Liqo leverages a combination of feature extraction, model selection, and online learning to adapt to changing workloads and data distributions. Experimental results on a comprehensive benchmark suite demonstrate that Liqo achieves significant speedups over traditional query optimization techniques, while maintaining robustness and accuracy.
