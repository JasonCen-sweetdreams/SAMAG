Gamification has emerged as a promising approach to enhance learner engagement in educational settings. However, static difficulty levels can lead to boredom or frustration, negatively impacting learning outcomes. This paper presents 'GazeDiff', an eye-gaze based system that dynamically adjusts game difficulty in real-time, responding to learners' cognitive states. Our approach leverages machine learning models to analyze pupil dilation, fixation duration, and saccade velocity, correlating these metrics with learner performance and affective states. A user study involving 40 participants demonstrates that GazeDiff significantly improves learning outcomes, learner satisfaction, and overall gaming experience.
