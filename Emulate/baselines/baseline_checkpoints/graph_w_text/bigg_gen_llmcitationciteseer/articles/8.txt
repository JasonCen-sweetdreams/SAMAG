Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial for various applications, but most existing methods lack interpretability. This paper introduces a novel hybrid attention-based neural network, 'HATS', which leverages both temporal and spatial attention mechanisms to identify anomalies. HATS incorporates a feature importance module to provide explanations for its predictions. We evaluate HATS on several real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach has significant implications for real-time monitoring and decision-making in domains such as finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity.
