Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising technology for immersive learning experiences. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatar-based feedback on user engagement in VR learning environments. We designed and implemented a novel feedback system that incorporates real-time user performance data and personalized avatar expressions. Our user study involving 120 participants showed significant improvements in user engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention compared to traditional feedback methods. The results suggest that personalized avatar-based feedback can be an effective strategy for enhancing user experience in VR learning environments.
