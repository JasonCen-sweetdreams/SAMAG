Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem due to the complexity of agent interactions and the need for adaptability in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. We design a decentralized Q-network that enables agents to learn cooperative policies for task allocation while considering resource constraints and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
