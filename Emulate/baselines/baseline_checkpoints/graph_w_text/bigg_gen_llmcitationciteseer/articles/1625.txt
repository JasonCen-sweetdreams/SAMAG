E-commerce product search often relies on keyword-based queries, which can be imprecise and lead to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Neural Query Expansion (HNQE) model that leverages both semantic and syntactic features to generate more informative and context-aware queries. HNQE consists of a hierarchical encoder that captures long-range dependencies in product titles and descriptions, and a neural expansion module that adaptively generates new query terms based on the input query and product context. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HNQE significantly improves search relevance and retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
