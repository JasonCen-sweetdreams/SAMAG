Short-text retrieval is a challenging task in information retrieval due to the limited context and ambiguity of query terms. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, which learns to generate relevant expansion terms from a large corpus of text data. Our model, called DeepQE, incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
