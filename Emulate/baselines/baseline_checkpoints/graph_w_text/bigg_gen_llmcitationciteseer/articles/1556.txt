Temporal graphs have become increasingly important in various applications, including social network analysis and recommendation systems. However, querying temporal graphs efficiently remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'TGIX', which leverages the temporal and structural properties of these graphs. TGIX employs a hybrid indexing approach that combines a temporal-partitioned graph index with a novel graph-structured Bloom filter. Our experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that TGIX outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage efficiency.
