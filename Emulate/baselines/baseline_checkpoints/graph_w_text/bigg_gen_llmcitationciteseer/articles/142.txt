Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly improve the accuracy of search results. However, traditional query expansion techniques are often limited by their inability to capture complex semantic relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Query Expansion (HQE) framework that leverages deep neural networks to learn hierarchical representations of query terms. Our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving a mean average precision increase of 12.5%. We also demonstrate the efficiency of HQE in reducing the number of query iterations required for optimal results.
