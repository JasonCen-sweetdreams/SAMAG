Older adults with motor impairments face significant challenges interacting with technology, leading to social isolation and decreased quality of life. This paper presents a novel adaptive gesture recognition system, 'EasyGesture', designed to accommodate varying levels of motor ability. EasyGesture uses a hierarchical machine learning approach, combining computer vision and inertial sensor data to recognize gestures. The system adaptively adjusts its recognition threshold and provides real-time feedback to users, enabling accurate gesture recognition despite motor impairments. A user study with 30 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
