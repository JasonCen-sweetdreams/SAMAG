Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in ad-hoc search tasks, but their computational cost and memory requirements remain significant barriers to deployment. This paper proposes a hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages the strengths of both neural and traditional retrieval models. Our method first uses a neural reranker to identify relevant top-ranked documents, and then applies a hierarchical clustering algorithm to expand the query using context-aware phrase extraction. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable retrieval performance to state-of-the-art neural models while reducing computational cost by up to 75%.
