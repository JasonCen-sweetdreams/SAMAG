Virtual reality (VR) has become a popular platform for social interactions, but the emotional contagion effect in these environments remains understudied. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars on emotional contagion in VR, using a mixed-methods approach combining physiological measures and self-reported surveys. Our results show that users who interact with personalized avatars exhibit increased emotional contagion compared to those with non-personalized avatars, particularly in high-arousal emotional scenarios. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR experiences that promote emotional well-being and empathy.
