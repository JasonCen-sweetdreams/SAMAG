In multi-agent systems, conflicts often arise due to differing goals or resource constraints. This paper proposes a novel framework for proactive conflict resolution using deep reinforcement learning. Our approach, 'ProCR', leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and anticipates potential conflicts. A deep Q-network is then employed to learn optimal conflict resolution strategies. We evaluate ProCR in a simulated traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved system efficiency and reduced conflicts compared to reactive conflict resolution methods.
