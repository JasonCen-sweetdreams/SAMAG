Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) systems, aiming to improve the retrieval effectiveness by reformulating the original query. In this paper, we propose a novel neural retrieval model-based query expansion approach, dubbed NeuroQE. NeuroQE leverages the power of deep learning to learn semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our approach uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively incorporate relevant terms from the top-retrieved documents, leading to more informative and diverse query expansions. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc IR benchmark dataset demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
