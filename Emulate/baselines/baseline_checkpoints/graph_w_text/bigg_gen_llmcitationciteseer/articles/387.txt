This paper explores the effect of embodiment on social presence in virtual reality (VR) environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, where we manipulated the level of embodiment through different VR interface conditions. Our results show that increased embodiment leads to higher social presence, trust, and cooperation in virtual interactions. Furthermore, we found that the sense of embodiment is influenced by the user's personality traits, such as extroversion and empathy. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to facilitate social interactions and collaboration.
