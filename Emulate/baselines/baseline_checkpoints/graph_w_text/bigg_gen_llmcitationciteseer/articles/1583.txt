Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way humans interact with digital information, but current interaction methods often feel unnatural and limited. This paper investigates the role of embodiment in VR, focusing on gesture-based interaction as a means to enhance user experience. We conducted a user study to compare three gesture recognition systems, evaluating their impact on user engagement, cognitive load, and overall satisfaction. Our results indicate that a machine learning-based approach, incorporating contextual and spatial awareness, outperforms traditional computer vision-based methods. The findings have significant implications for the design of intuitive and immersive VR interfaces, unlocking the full potential of VR for various applications.
