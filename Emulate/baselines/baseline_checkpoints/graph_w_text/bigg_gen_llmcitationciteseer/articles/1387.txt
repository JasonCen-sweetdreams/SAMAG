Query auto-completion (QAC) is a crucial component of modern search engines, aiming to predict the user's intended query based on the partial input. This paper introduces a novel neural ranking model, 'SessionRank', which exploits the session context to improve QAC performance. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture the semantic relationships between the query prefix, session history, and candidate completions. Experimental results on the AOL query log dataset demonstrate that SessionRank outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean reciprocal rank and coverage rate, with significant improvements in computational efficiency.
