Emerging applications in IoT, finance, and healthcare demand real-time analytics capabilities. However, traditional row-store databases struggle to handle the high velocity and variability of modern data. This paper presents 'SkewCol', a novel columnar storage architecture designed to mitigate performance degradation under data skew. By adaptively reorganizing column groups based on frequency and cardinality, SkewCol reduces query latency by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art column stores. We evaluate SkewCol using a range of real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in supporting interactive analytics workloads.
