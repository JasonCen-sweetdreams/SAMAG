The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of heterogeneous data sources, making data integration a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to scalable data integration using knowledge graph embeddings. We design a distributed framework that leverages graph neural networks to learn entity embeddings from large-scale IoT datasets. Our approach enables efficient data integration by identifying and reconciling entities across disparate data sources. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving data integration accuracy and scalability.
