Distributed databases with multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) enable high concurrency and low latency, but pose significant query optimization challenges. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MVCC-OPT', which leverages a cost-based approach to optimize query execution plans for MVCC-enabled distributed databases. We introduce a probabilistic model to estimate the likelihood of version conflicts and develop a dynamic optimization strategy that adaptively adjusts to workload changes. Experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database system shows that MVCC-OPT reduces query latency by up to 35% and improves throughput by up to 25% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
