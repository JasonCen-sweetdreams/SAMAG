In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, autonomous agents may have conflicting interests and require incentives to participate. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that incorporates incentive mechanisms to encourage agents to contribute to the system's overall welfare. We design a hierarchical auction-based mechanism that allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities and preferences, while also ensuring fairness and system efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of system utility and individual agent satisfaction.
