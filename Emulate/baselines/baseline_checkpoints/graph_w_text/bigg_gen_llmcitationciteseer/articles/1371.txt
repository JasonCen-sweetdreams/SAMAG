Traditional document representation methods in information retrieval (IR) systems often neglect the importance of contextual information. This paper proposes a novel context-aware document representation model, 'CADET', which incorporates both local and global contextual features to capture the nuances of document semantics. CADET leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different contextual elements, improving the retrieval performance by 15% compared to state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of CADET in scenarios with limited training data, making it a promising approach for real-world IR applications.
