This paper introduces a novel approach to document retrieval using Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT). HGAT leverages the graph structure of documents to model relationships between entities, and incorporates attention mechanisms to focus on relevant contexts. Our experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional keyword-based methods. Furthermore, we show that HGAT can be effectively applied to multi-hop question answering tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on the HotPotQA benchmark.
