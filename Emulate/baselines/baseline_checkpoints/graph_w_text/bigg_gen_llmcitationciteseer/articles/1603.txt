Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on efficient route planning to minimize travel time and energy consumption. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, 'RouteOpt', which leverages graph neural networks to learn optimal routing policies for AVs. We introduce a multi-agent environment that simulates real-world traffic patterns and demonstrate that RouteOpt outperforms traditional graph-based methods in terms of route efficiency and adaptability to changing traffic conditions. Experiments on a large-scale urban traffic dataset show that RouteOpt reduces average travel time by up to 23% compared to state-of-the-art methods.
