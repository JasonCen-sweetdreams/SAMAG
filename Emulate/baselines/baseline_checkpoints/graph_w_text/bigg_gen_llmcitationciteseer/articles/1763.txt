Few-shot learning has gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing approaches rely on manually crafted prototypes or meta-learning techniques that require extensive computational resources. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical few-shot learning framework, 'AdaProto', which leverages adaptive prototype graphs to effectively capture the underlying structure of the data. By dynamically adjusting the graph topology and prototype distances during training, AdaProto achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark image classification datasets, including mini-ImageNet and CIFAR-FS, with minimal computational overhead. We also provide a thorough analysis of the robustness and interpretability of our approach.
