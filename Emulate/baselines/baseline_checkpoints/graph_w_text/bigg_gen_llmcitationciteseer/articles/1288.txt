Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep neural language models to learn query expansion strategies. We introduce a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query representation, term weighting, and expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods, especially for difficult queries with limited relevance feedback.
