The proliferation of fake news on social media has severe consequences for individuals and society. Existing detection methods often rely on hand-crafted features or complex neural networks, lacking transparency and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attentional Graph Convolutional Network (HAGCN) for explainable fake news detection. HAGCN captures the complex relationships between news articles, user interactions, and source credibility by learning hierarchical attention weights on graph-structured data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGCN on a large-scale fake news dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing visual explanations for its predictions.
