As the global population ages, it is essential to design interfaces that are accessible and usable by older adults. This paper presents a participatory study on gesture-based interaction, where we collaborated with 20 older adults to co-design and evaluate a gesture-based system for smart home devices. Our results show that older adults preferred simple, intuitive gestures and valued feedback mechanisms that confirmed their actions. We also identified design recommendations for gesture-based interfaces that cater to the needs and abilities of older adults, including the use of larger targets, slower gesture recognition, and multimodal feedback.
