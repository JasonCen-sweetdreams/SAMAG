Traditional ranking models in information retrieval rely on handcrafted features and simplistic query-document interactions. This paper proposes a novel neural graph-based relevance model, 'GraphRM', which captures complex relationships between queries, documents, and entities. We design a heterogeneous graph neural network that incorporates entity embeddings, query-document interactions, and document structure to estimate relevance scores. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphRM outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, particularly in cases involving ambiguous queries and long documents.
