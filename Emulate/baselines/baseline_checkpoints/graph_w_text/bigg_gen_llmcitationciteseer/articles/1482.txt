As big data continues to grow, scalable and efficient query processing becomes crucial for data analytics. This paper proposes a novel query processing framework, 'DHTEQ', which leverages distributed hash tables (DHTs) to partition and process large datasets in parallel. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that dynamically reconfigures the DHT-based query plan to minimize network communication and reduce query latency. Experimental results on a real-world genomic dataset demonstrate that DHTEQ outperforms traditional distributed query processing approaches by up to 3x in terms of query response time and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
