This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating autonomous agents for dynamic task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized, multi-agent framework that enables agents to learn cooperative policies for task assignment and execution. Our method leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and incorporates a curriculum-based learning strategy to handle varying task complexities. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced agent collisions compared to traditional, rule-based allocation methods.
