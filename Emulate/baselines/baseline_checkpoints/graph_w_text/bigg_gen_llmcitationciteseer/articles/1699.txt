Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly used in complex domains such as robotics, smart cities, and healthcare. However, task allocation in MAS remains a challenging problem, especially when agents have diverse capabilities and tasks require collaboration. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning approach, 'RL-TASK', which enables autonomous task allocation in MAS. RL-TASK uses a decentralized, actor-critic architecture to learn task allocation policies that maximize system-level rewards. We evaluate RL-TASK on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced response times compared to traditional, rule-based allocation methods.
