Multi-agent systems (MAS) often require efficient task planning to achieve complex goals. However, in real-world scenarios, agent goals may be uncertain or probabilistic. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning framework, 'U-Plan', that can handle uncertain goals in MAS. U-Plan integrates probabilistic goal models with HTN planning to generate robust and adaptive plans. We propose a probabilistic plan evaluation metric, 'Expected Plan Quality', to quantify the likelihood of achieving uncertain goals. Experimental results on a simulated robotic soccer domain demonstrate that U-Plan outperforms existing HTN planners in uncertain goal settings.
