Hierarchical task models have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling complex tasks in AI systems. However, learning these models from demonstrations is challenging, especially in online settings where new tasks and demonstrations arrive continuously. We propose a novel approach, Deep Imitation Learning of Hierarchical Tasks (DILT), that leverages deep neural networks to learn hierarchical task models from demonstrations. DILT uses a hierarchical Variational Autoencoder to learn a compact representation of tasks and a policy network to infer the task hierarchy. We evaluate DILT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to efficiently learn hierarchical task models in online settings, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
