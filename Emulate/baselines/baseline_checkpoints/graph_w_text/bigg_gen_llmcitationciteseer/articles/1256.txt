Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it helps to mitigate the vocabulary mismatch problem. However, existing QE methods often incur high computational costs, making them impractical for large-scale document collections. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical QE approach that leverages a tiered indexing structure to efficiently prune irrelevant terms. Our method, termed 'HiQE', incorporates a probabilistic relevance model and a greedy term selection strategy to identify the most informative expansion terms. Experimental results on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that HiQE achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art QE methods.
