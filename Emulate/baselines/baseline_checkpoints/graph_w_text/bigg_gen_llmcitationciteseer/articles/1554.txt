This paper presents a novel autonomous agent-based crowd simulation framework for emergency evacuation planning. Our approach leverages decentralized decision-making and real-time sensor data to simulate the complex behaviors of individuals in emergency scenarios. We propose a hybrid architecture that combines rule-based and machine learning-based agent decision-making, enabling more realistic and adaptive crowd simulations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing evacuation times and improving safety in various emergency scenarios.
