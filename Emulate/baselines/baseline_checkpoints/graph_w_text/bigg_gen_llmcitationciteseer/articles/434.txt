Distributed column-store databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data analytics. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to improve query execution efficiency. We introduce a column-oriented cost model that accurately estimates query execution times and proposes a set of optimization techniques to reduce data transfer and processing costs. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
