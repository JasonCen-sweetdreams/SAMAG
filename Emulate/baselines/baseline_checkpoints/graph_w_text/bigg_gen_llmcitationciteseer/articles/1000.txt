 Passage retrieval is a crucial component of many information retrieval systems. However, existing methods often rely on fixed document representations, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document representation approach, 'QADR', which dynamically adjusts the document encoding based on the query context. We introduce a neural network-based framework that learns to weight and combine different document features in response to the query, resulting in more accurate passage retrieval. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
