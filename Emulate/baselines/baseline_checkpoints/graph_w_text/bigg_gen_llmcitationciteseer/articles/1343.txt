Information retrieval systems often struggle to return diverse and relevant documents in response to complex queries. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages hierarchical clustering and deep semantic embeddings to improve the diversity and relevance of retrieved documents. Our method, called HierDiv, first uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group similar documents based on their semantic embeddings. Then, it selects a diverse set of documents from each cluster using a maximum marginal relevance criterion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that HierDiv significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of novelty, diversity, and relevance metrics.
