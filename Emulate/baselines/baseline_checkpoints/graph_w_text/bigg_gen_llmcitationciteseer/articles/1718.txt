The increasing use of autonomous agents in various applications has raised the need for efficient coordination mechanisms. This paper proposes a decentralized framework for coordinating autonomous agents using blockchain-based consensus protocols. Our approach leverages the immutability and transparency properties of blockchain to enable agents to reach consensus on a shared goal without relying on a centralized authority. We evaluate our framework through simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness in scenarios involving multiple agents with conflicting goals. The results show that our approach can significantly improve the coordination efficiency and robustness of autonomous agent systems.
