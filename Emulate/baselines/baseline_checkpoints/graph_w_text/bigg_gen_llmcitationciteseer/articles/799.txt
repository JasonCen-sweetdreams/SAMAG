Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults, but their design often neglects the unique needs and abilities of this demographic. This paper presents a participatory design study with 20 older adults, exploring their preferences and challenges when interacting with voice-based conversational agents. We identify key design recommendations, including the use of simple and consistent language, explicit error handling, and personalized feedback. Our findings inform the development of more accessible and usable conversational interfaces that support older adults' autonomy and independence.
