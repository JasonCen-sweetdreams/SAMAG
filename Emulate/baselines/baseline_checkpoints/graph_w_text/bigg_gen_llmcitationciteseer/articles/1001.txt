Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it enables the incorporation of relevant terms to improve the retrieval performance. However, traditional query expansion methods rely on manual feature engineering and often fail to capture semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a neural-based query expansion approach, NeuralQE, which leverages pre-trained word embeddings to learn a dense representation of query terms. We demonstrate that NeuralQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods on several benchmark datasets, including Robust04 and ClueWeb09, and achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
