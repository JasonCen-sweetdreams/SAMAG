Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it can significantly impact search result relevance. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using context-aware word embeddings, which capture nuanced semantic relationships between words in a query. We introduce a neural network-based model that jointly learns word embeddings and query expansion weights, outperforming traditional methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving retrieval performance, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
