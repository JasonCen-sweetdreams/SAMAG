Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural document embeddings to better model semantic relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'NeuQE', uses a dense passage retrieval model to generate contextualized embeddings for query terms and relevant documents. These embeddings are then used to expand the original query with semantically similar terms, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Experiments on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate the efficacy of NeuQE, achieving a 12% increase in mean average precision over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
