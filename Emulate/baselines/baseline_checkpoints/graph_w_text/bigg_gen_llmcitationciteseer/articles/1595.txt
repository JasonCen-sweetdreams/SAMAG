Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, existing methods often struggle with scale and robustness. This paper introduces 'GraphCon', a novel graph-based contrastive learning framework for anomaly detection in time-series data. By modeling the data as a graph and leveraging contrastive learning, GraphCon can efficiently handle large datasets and capture complex patterns. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphCon outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
