This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation approach for autonomous robots using dynamic coalition formation. Our method, called 'Coalition-Robot', allows robots to form and dissolve coalitions dynamically to allocate tasks efficiently. We model the task allocation problem as a decentralized multi-agent system and propose a algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning with graph theory to optimize coalition formation. Experimental results show that Coalition-Robot outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
