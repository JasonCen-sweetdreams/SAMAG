RDF graph databases are increasingly used to store and query large-scale semantic data. However, query optimization for these databases remains a challenging problem due to the complex nature of RDF data and the variability of query workloads. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans based on a reward function that captures the trade-off between query execution time and memory usage. Our experiments on a real-world RDF dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average query execution time reduction of 34% and a memory usage reduction of 27%.
