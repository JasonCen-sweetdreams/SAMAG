Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR) due to the inherent complexity of natural language queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to improve retrieval effectiveness by incorporating query-driven document expansion using graph-based document representation. Our method, dubbed 'GraphExpan', leverages a graph neural network to encode semantic relationships between documents and expands the query context by incorporating relevant terms from neighboring documents. Experimental results on the TREC dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in retrieval performance, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, showcasing the potential of GraphExpan for real-world IR applications.
