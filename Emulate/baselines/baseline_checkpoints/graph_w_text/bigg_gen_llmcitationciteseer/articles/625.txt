Ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) systems often struggle to accurately capture users' search intent. We propose a novel approach, 'QL-Expander', which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query expansion for improved retrieval performance. By formulating query expansion as a Markov Decision Process, our RL agent learns to select the most informative expansion terms that maximize the expected relevance of retrieved documents. Experimental results on the TREC Ad-hoc benchmark demonstrate that QL-Expander outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
