Query expansion is a crucial technique for enhancing the relevance of search results in e-commerce applications. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages user behavior, product categories, and query intent to generate more informative and relevant queries. CAQE incorporates a graph-based method to model the relationships between query terms, products, and user interactions, enabling more accurate and personalized search results. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of precision, recall, and user satisfaction.
