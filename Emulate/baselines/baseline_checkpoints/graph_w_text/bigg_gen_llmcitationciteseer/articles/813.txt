Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in ad-hoc search tasks, but their computational cost and memory requirements hinder their adoption in large-scale search engines. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, 'NeuralIndex', which leverages the underlying neural network's architecture to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. We introduce a hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups semantically similar documents, enabling fast filtering and scoring of candidates. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that NeuralIndex achieves a 3x speedup over existing approaches while maintaining comparable retrieval performance.
