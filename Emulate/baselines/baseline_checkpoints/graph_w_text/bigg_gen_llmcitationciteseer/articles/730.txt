Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources to meet dynamic workload demands. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'CloudOpt', which learns to optimize resource allocation in real-time. CloudOpt leverages a hybrid approach combining a deep Q-network (DQN) with a graph neural network (GNN) to model complex dependencies between resources and workloads. We evaluate CloudOpt on a large-scale cloud computing dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art allocation policies.
