Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages hierarchical clustering and graph neural networks (GNNs) to identify anomalies in time-series data. Our method, HierGNN, represents time-series data as a graph, where each node corresponds to a time step, and edges capture temporal dependencies. Hierarchical clustering is applied to identify dense regions in the graph, and GNNs are used to learn a robust representation of the data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to noise.
