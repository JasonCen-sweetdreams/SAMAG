Node classification in heterogeneous graphs is a challenging task due to the varying importance of different node types and relationships. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages the hierarchical structure of graphs to learn node representations. HGAT uses a multi-level attention mechanism to capture both local and global context, and a type-aware aggregation strategy to combine information from different node types. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 5.2% in node classification accuracy.
