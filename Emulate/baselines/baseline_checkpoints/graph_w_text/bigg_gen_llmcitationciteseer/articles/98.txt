Virtual reality (VR) has transformed human-computer interaction, but the role of embodied cognition in VR remains understudied. This paper investigates the effects of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load and task performance in VR. We designed an experiment involving 30 participants, who performed a series of spatial reasoning tasks using either gesture-based or controller-based interfaces. Results show that gesture-based interaction reduces cognitive load and improves task performance, suggesting that embodied cognition plays a significant role in VR. We discuss implications for the design of intuitive and efficient VR interfaces, highlighting the potential for gesture-based interaction to enhance user experience.
