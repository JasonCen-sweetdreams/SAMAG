Large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for various AI applications, but their construction is hindered by the entity disambiguation problem. Existing approaches are limited by their inability to handle ambiguous entities with varying frequencies and contexts. We propose a hierarchical entity disambiguation framework, 'HEDGES', which leverages graph neural networks and hierarchical clustering to disambiguate entities at multiple scales. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Wikidata5M benchmark, with a 22% increase in precision and 15% reduction in computational cost compared to existing methods.
