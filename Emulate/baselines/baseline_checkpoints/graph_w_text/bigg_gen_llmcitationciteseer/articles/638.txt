Neural ranking models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but their computational cost hinders their deployment in real-world search engines. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'NeuroOpt', which leverages the structural properties of neural networks to reduce the number of model evaluations required during query processing. Our approach involves query rewriting, early termination, and parallelization techniques that can be seamlessly integrated into existing search engine architectures. Experimental results on the MS MARCO dataset demonstrate that NeuroOpt reduces query latency by up to 75% while maintaining retrieval effectiveness.
