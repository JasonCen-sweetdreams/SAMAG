Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly used in real-world applications, but their complexity poses significant challenges for reasoning and decision-making. This paper introduces a novel distributed reasoning framework, 'LogiMAS', which leverages logical networks to facilitate scalable and efficient inference among agents. By representing agent knowledge as logical formulas and exploiting the structural properties of networks, LogiMAS enables agents to reason about global states and make collective decisions without requiring a centralized controller. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of LogiMAS in reducing communication overhead and improving system resilience.
