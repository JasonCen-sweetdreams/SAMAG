Distributed column-store databases have become increasingly popular for big data analytics, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing query performance by integrating learned index structures with distributed query execution. We propose a hybrid indexing scheme that combines traditional B-tree indexing with learned index models, trained on query workload patterns. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that the proposed approach can achieve up to 3x improvement in query response time and 2x reduction in storage overhead, compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
