The increasing adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices has led to a surge in sensor data, making real-time anomaly detection a critical task. This paper proposes a novel graph-based attention mechanism, 'GAT-AD', which leverages the complex relationships between IIoT devices to identify anomalies in real-time. Our approach combines graph convolutional networks with attention weights to focus on the most informative device interactions. Experimental results on a large-scale IIoT dataset demonstrate that GAT-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and latency, enabling timely interventions to prevent equipment failures and maintain production efficiency.
