Query-driven summarization is a critical task in information retrieval, where the goal is to generate a concise summary of a document set in response to a user query. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical neural network architecture, HierSum, which leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and document sentences to improve summarization performance. Our model consists of a query encoder, sentence encoder, and a hierarchical summarizer that generates a summary by selecting and ranking sentences based on their relevance to the query. Experimental results on the TREC news dataset demonstrate that HierSum outperforms state-of-the-art summarization models in terms of ROUGE scores and human evaluation metrics.
