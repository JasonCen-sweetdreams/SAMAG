Main-memory column-stores have become increasingly popular for analytical workloads due to their performance benefits. However, indexing high-dimensional data in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'HDIX', which leverages a combination of bit-vector compression and clustering-based indexing to efficiently store and query high-dimensional data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HDIX through an extensive evaluation on real-world benchmarks, showing significant improvements in query performance and storage efficiency compared to existing indexing techniques.
