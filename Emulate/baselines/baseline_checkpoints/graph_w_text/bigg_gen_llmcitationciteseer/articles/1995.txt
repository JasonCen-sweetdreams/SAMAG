Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it directly affects the quality of search results. Traditional query expansion methods rely on term co-occurrence or statistical models, which may not capture the complex relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding approach, 'GraphExpan', which represents query terms as nodes in a graph and leverages their semantic relationships to identify relevant expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphExpan outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing the computational cost of query expansion.
