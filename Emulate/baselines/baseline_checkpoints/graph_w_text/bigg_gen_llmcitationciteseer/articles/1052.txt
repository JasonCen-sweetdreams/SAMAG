In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Our approach represents the agent-task graph as a dynamic network, where agents and tasks are nodes, and edges denote potential assignments. We design a GCN-based model that learns to predict task assignment probabilities, taking into account agent capabilities, task requirements, and network constraints. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
