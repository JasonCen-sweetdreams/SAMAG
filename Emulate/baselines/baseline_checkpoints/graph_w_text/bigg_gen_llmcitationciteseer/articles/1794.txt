This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, leveraging auction-based mechanisms to efficiently assign tasks to agents in dynamic environments. Our approach, called 'AuctionAgent', enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities, preferences, and local contextual information. We introduce a novel bidding strategy that incorporates temporal and spatial constraints, ensuring that tasks are allocated to agents that can complete them effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that AuctionAgent outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rates, agent satisfaction, and communication overhead.
