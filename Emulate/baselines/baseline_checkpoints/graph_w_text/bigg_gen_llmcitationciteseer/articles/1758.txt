With the increasing adoption of column-store databases for multidimensional data warehousing, query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization that leverages the benefits of column-store indexing. We introduce a cost-based optimizer that takes into account the storage and retrieval patterns of column-store databases, reducing query execution times by up to 30%. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving query performance and scalability.
