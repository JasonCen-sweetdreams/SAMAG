Human activity recognition (HAR) has numerous applications in healthcare, surveillance, and robotics. This paper introduces Graph-TAN, a novel deep learning framework that leverages graph-based temporal attention mechanisms to model complex human activities. By explicitly modeling the temporal dependencies between body joints, Graph-TAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, outperforming existing CNN- and RNN-based approaches. We demonstrate the real-time capability of Graph-TAN on a mobile device, enabling accurate and efficient HAR for various applications.
