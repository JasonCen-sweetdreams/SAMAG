Decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem due to the inherent complexity of coordinating agents with limited communication and partial observability. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'DTRL', that enables agents to learn decentralized task allocation policies in a self-organizing manner. We introduce a hierarchical graph neural network architecture that incorporates local observations, communication graphs, and task dependencies to generate effective task assignments. Experimental results on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that DTRL outperforms existing decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, communication overhead, and adaptability to dynamic task arrivals.
