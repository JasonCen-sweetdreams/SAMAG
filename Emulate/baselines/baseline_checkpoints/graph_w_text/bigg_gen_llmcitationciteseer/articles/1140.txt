In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach to cooperative task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We formulate the task allocation problem as a DCOP, where agents negotiate to assign tasks while respecting constraints on resource availability, task dependencies, and agent capabilities. Our algorithm, called CATS, leverages a hybrid of centralized and decentralized optimization techniques to find near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that CATS outperforms existing decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system utility.
