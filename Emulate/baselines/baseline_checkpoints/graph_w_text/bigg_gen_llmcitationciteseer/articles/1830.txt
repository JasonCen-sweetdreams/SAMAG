Conventional indexing techniques for document retrieval often struggle to balance query latency and retrieval quality. We propose a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'DeepIR', which leverages deep learning to learn a hierarchical representation of documents. This enables efficient pruning of irrelevant documents at multiple levels, resulting in significant reductions in query latency. Our experiments on large-scale document collections demonstrate that DeepIR outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and query efficiency.
