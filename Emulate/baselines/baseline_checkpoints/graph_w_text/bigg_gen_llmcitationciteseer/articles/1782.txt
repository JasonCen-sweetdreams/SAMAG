The lack of transparency in e-commerce search engines hinders users' trust and understanding of retrieval results. This paper proposes an explainable retrieval framework, 'Query2Vec+', which incorporates semantic and syntactic Knowledge Graph embeddings to enrich query representations. By learning to map queries to relevant product aspects, our approach generates interpretable explanations for retrieved products. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search accuracy and user satisfaction, while providing intuitive explanations for the retrieved products.
