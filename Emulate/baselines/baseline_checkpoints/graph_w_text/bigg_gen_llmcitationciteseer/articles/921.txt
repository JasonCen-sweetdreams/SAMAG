Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their conversational strategies often overlook the needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the impact of conversational design on user experience and accessibility. We propose a novel framework, 'ConverseIn', which incorporates disability-specific design guidelines and user testing. Our evaluation with 30 participants with disabilities reveals that ConverseIn significantly improves user satisfaction, reduces frustration, and enhances overall accessibility. We discuss implications for designing inclusive voice assistants that cater to diverse user needs.
