Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their utility is limited for older adults with hearing impairments. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'ClearVoice', a novel voice assistant system tailored to the needs of this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants to understand their challenges and preferences. ClearVoice incorporates acoustic models trained on hearing-impaired speech, visual feedback mechanisms, and personalized audio enhancement. Our results show that ClearVoice significantly improves speech recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants, demonstrating the potential for inclusive design to bridge the accessibility gap.
