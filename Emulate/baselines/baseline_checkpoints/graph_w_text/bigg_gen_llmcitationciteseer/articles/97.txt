Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, yet its performance has plateaued in recent years. We propose a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQE', that leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and document contents. Our model consists of a hierarchical attention network that captures both local and global context, enabling more effective term weighting and selection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE techniques, particularly for queries with low term frequency and high ambiguity.
