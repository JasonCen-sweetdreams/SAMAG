Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper presents a deep learning approach to query expansion, which learns to generate context-aware expansion terms from a large corpus of text data. We further propose a learning-to-rank framework that integrates the expanded query with a relevance-based ranking model. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
