Ad hoc retrieval systems often struggle with capturing the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel context-aware query expansion approach that leverages graph-based embeddings to model the relationships between query terms and their surrounding context. Our method, dubbed 'CAQE', incorporates a graph convolutional network to encode query-dependent context features, which are then used to expand the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, particularly for queries with ambiguous or heterogeneous terms.
