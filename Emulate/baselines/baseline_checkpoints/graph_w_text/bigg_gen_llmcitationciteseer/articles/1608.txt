Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it significantly affects the precision and recall of search results. This paper presents a novel approach to semantic query expansion using deep neural networks, called DeepQE. We propose a multi-task learning framework that jointly learns to predict query-term importance and semantic relationships between terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision and a 20% reduction in computational time.
