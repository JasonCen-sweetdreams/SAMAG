The proliferation of big data has led to a surge in distributed database systems, which pose significant challenges for query optimization. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using graph-based methods. We model the database schema as a graph and leverage graph neural networks to learn a robust representation of query patterns. Our proposed algorithm, 'GraphOpt', uses this representation to efficiently prune the search space of possible query plans, reducing optimization time by up to 50%. Experimental results on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphOpt in improving query performance and scalability.
