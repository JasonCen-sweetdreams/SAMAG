With the increasing adoption of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, understanding user engagement is crucial for designing effective VR experiences. This study explores the impact of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, manipulating avatar personalization and task complexity. Results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported enjoyment. Furthermore, we found that the effect of avatar personalization is more pronounced in complex tasks. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems, suggesting that incorporating personalized avatars can enhance user experience and motivation.
