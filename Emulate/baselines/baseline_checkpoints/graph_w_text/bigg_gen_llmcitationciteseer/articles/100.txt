Outlier detection in high-dimensional data is a challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality. Existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity or poor performance. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'IsoSample', which combines the Isolation Forest algorithm with distance-based sampling to detect outliers efficiently. IsoSample leverages the random feature selection property of Isolation Forest to reduce the dimensionality and then uses distance-based sampling to identify outliers in the reduced space. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that IsoSample outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
