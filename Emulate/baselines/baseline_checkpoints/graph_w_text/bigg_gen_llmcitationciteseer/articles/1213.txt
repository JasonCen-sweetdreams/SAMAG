Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in decentralized settings where agents have limited communication and computation resources. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn efficient task allocation strategies. Our method, called GNN-TA, represents the agent-task graph as a learnable neural network, enabling agents to learn task allocation policies through self-organized communication and negotiation. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation benchmarks demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms traditional decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
