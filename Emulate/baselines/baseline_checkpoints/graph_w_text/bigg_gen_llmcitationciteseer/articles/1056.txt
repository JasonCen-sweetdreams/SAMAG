As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly pervasive, human-robot collaboration in VR environments is gaining importance. This paper investigates the role of embodiment in facilitating effective collaboration between humans and robots in VR. We designed a user study where participants interacted with a robot in a virtual assembly task, and manipulated the level of embodiment using different virtual avatar representations. Our results show that increased embodiment leads to improved task performance, higher trust, and reduced communication errors. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future human-robot collaboration systems in VR.
