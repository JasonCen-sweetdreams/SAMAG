Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to transform various aspects of our lives, but user experience remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption. This paper explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience in VR environments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants, who interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a social VR scenario. Our results show that users interacting with personalized avatars reported higher levels of presence, engagement, and overall satisfaction, while also exhibiting reduced symptoms of VR-induced anxiety and motion sickness. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of future VR systems.
