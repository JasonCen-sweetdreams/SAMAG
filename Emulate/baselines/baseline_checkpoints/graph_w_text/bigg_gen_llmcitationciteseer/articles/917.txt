As transactional databases grow in scale and complexity, efficient data partitioning becomes crucial for maintaining high performance and low latency. This paper presents a novel data partitioning algorithm, 'ParTx', which leverages graph-based clustering and load balancing to minimize transactional conflicts and optimize resource utilization. We evaluate ParTx on a real-world e-commerce dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in throughput, latency, and resource efficiency compared to existing partitioning schemes.
