Query expansion is an essential technique to improve the retrieval effectiveness of information retrieval systems. However, traditional methods often struggle with sparse document collections. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our approach, 'EmbedExpan', learns to represent queries and documents as dense vectors and expands the query using a graph-based algorithm that incorporates both semantic and co-occurrence information. Experimental results on several sparse benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and NDCG.
