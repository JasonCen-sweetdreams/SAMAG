Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information, but personalized experiences are still in their infancy. This paper explores the effect of personalization on user engagement in VR environments. We designed and conducted a user study with 120 participants, exposing them to either a personalized or non-personalized VR experience. Our results show that personalized experiences lead to increased user satisfaction, reduced cognitive load, and higher engagement levels. We also identify key factors influencing personalization effectiveness, including user demographics and task complexity. Our findings have significant implications for the development of personalized VR applications.
