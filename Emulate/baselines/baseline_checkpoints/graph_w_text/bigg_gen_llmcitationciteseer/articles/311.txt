Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to enrich the daily lives of people with visual impairments, but existing interfaces often neglect their needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating inclusive AR interfaces that cater to users with visual impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with visually impaired participants, identifying critical accessibility barriers and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed design framework, 'AR4VI', integrates audio-based feedback, tactile cues, and personalized font customization to enhance the AR experience for visually impaired users. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to existing AR interfaces.
