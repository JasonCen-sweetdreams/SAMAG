Knowledge graph embedding has become a crucial task in various applications, including question answering and recommendation systems. However, entity disambiguation remains a significant challenge due to the inherent ambiguity of entity names. This paper proposes a novel approach, HGA-KE, which leverages hierarchical graph attention networks to disambiguate entities in knowledge graphs. Our method exploits the hierarchical structure of the graph to capture complex relationships between entities and their contexts. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGA-KE outperforms state-of-the-art models in entity disambiguation tasks, achieving an average improvement of 12.5% in F1-score.
