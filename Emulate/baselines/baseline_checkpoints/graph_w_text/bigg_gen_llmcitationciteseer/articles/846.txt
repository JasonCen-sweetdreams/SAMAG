Domain-specific search engines require effective query expansion techniques to retrieve relevant results. This paper proposes a context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which incorporates domain knowledge and user preferences into the expansion process. CAQE utilizes a multi-layered neural network to learn context embeddings from query logs and domain-specific ontologies. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and response time, making it a promising solution for efficient information retrieval in domain-specific search.
