Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large volumes of data and high query throughput. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to select the most effective indexes for a given query workload. We develop a framework that uses query execution statistics and database schema information to train a predictive model, which then recommends an optimal index configuration. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach can improve query performance by up to 30% compared to traditional indexing methods.
