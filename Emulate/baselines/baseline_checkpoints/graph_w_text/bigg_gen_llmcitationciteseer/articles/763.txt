Modern information retrieval systems are plagued by the curse of dimensionality, leading to inefficient document filtering and retrieval. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach that leverages keyword extraction to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional document vectors. Our method, called Hierarchical Keyword-based Filtering (HKF), uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group similar documents based on their keyword distributions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HKF on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in filtering efficiency and retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
