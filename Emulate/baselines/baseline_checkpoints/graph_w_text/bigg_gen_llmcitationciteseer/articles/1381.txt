Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing and customer relationship management. However, traditional clustering algorithms struggle to scale with large datasets and often fail to capture complex relationships between customers. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn effective representations of customers. Our method, 'DeepSeg', uses a stacked autoencoder to compress high-dimensional customer data and a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group customers based on their learned representations. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that DeepSeg outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency.
