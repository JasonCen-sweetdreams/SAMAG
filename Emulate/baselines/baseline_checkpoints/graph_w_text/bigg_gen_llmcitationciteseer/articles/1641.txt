Time-series data has become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, existing indexing techniques struggle to efficiently query massive-scale time-series data. This paper presents 'LTRee', a novel learned index structure that leverages machine learning models to predict the optimal query plan for time-series data. We demonstrate that LTRee significantly outperforms traditional indexing methods, such as B-trees and LSM-trees, in terms of query latency and throughput. Our experiments on real-world time-series datasets show that LTRee achieves up to 5x speedup in query processing while reducing storage overhead by 30%.
