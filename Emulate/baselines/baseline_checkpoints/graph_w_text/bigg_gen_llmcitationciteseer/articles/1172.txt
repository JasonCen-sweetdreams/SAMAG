Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for open-domain question answering. However, the computational complexity of neural retrieval hinders its scalability to large datasets. We propose a novel indexing scheme, 'NeurIX', which leverages the properties of dense embeddings to efficiently prune the search space. By combining a hierarchical navigable small world graph with a compact binary representation of passages, NeurIX achieves a 5x speedup in retrieval time while maintaining the same retrieval quality as exhaustive search. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of NeurIX in large-scale DPR systems.
