Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires accurate retrieval of relevant documents from a large corpus. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'QRDR', which leverages query-specific dense retrieval to improve the quality of retrieved documents. QRDR generates dense query embeddings using a neural encoder and uses these embeddings to search for relevant documents in the corpus. We introduce a novel ranking loss function that jointly optimizes the retrieval and ranking stages. Experiments on several ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that QRDR outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving significant improvements in both retrieval recall and end-to-end question answering accuracy.
