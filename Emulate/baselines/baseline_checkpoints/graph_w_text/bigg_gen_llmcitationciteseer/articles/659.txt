As the world transitions to renewable energy sources, smart grids face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources in real-time. This paper presents a novel multi-agent system, 'SmartAllocator', that coordinates autonomous agents to optimize resource allocation in smart grids. Our approach leverages advanced negotiation protocols and decentralized decision-making to minimize energy waste and reduce peak demand. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved performance compared to traditional centralized approaches. SmartAllocator has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the reliability of smart grids.
