Conventional information retrieval systems often prioritize relevance over diversity, leading to redundant and uninformative search results. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'CADR', which incorporates contextualized document embeddings and a diversity-promoting regularization term. Our approach leverages a transformer-based architecture to capture complex semantic relationships between documents and queries, while encouraging the retrieval of diverse and complementary results. Experimental evaluations on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CADR in improving retrieval diversity and user satisfaction.
