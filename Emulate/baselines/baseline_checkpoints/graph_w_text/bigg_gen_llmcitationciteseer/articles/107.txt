Coalition formation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to form teams to accomplish complex tasks. However, finding an optimal coalition structure is computationally expensive and often intractable. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn coalition formation policies. Our method, called CoForm, represents the agent interactions as a graph and uses GNNs to learn a latent representation of the coalition structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoForm in various benchmark domains, showing significant improvements in computational efficiency and solution quality compared to traditional methods.
