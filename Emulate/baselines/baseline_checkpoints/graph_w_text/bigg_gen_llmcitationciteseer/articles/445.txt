Query expansion is a crucial technique in ad-hoc retrieval to improve the retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion by leveraging deep semantic word embeddings. We develop a neural network-based model that learns to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion terms. The model is trained on a large-scale query log dataset and generates a set of expanded queries that are semantically similar to the original query. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods and achieves state-of-the-art results in ad-hoc retrieval tasks.
