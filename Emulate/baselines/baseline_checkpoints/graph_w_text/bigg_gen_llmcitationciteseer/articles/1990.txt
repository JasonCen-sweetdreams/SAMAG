Smart home devices have transformed the way we live, but individuals with disabilities often face significant barriers in interacting with these systems. This paper presents a novel voice-based interface, 'VocalEase', designed to improve accessibility in smart home environments. We conducted a series of user studies to inform the design of VocalEase, which incorporates personalized speech recognition, natural language understanding, and multimodal feedback. Our evaluation shows that VocalEase significantly reduces error rates and enhances user satisfaction for individuals with mobility and visual impairments. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the development of inclusive smart home systems.
