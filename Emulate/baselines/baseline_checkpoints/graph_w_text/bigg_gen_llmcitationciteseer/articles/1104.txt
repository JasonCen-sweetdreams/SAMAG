Real-time traffic prediction and route optimization are crucial for intelligent transportation systems. This paper proposes a hybrid agent-based framework that integrates machine learning, graph theory, and multi-agent systems to predict traffic patterns and optimize routes. Our framework consists of two types of agents: traffic predictor agents that utilize graph convolutional networks to forecast traffic flow, and route optimizer agents that employ ant colony optimization to find the shortest paths. Experimental results on a real-world traffic dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and route optimization efficiency.
