We investigate the problem of decentralized task allocation for heterogeneous agent teams, where agents possess diverse capabilities and communication constraints. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'AgentGNN', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a distributed task allocation strategy. Each agent maintains a local GNN that learns to predict task assignments based on its neighbors' information, enabling the team to adapt to dynamic environments. Our experiments on a realistic urban search and rescue scenario demonstrate that AgentGNN outperforms existing decentralized methods in terms of task completion efficiency and team utility.
