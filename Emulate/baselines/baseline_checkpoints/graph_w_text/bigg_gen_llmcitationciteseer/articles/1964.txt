Neural passage retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various information retrieval tasks. However, they often rely on simple keyword-based query representations, which may not capture the nuances of user queries. We propose a novel adaptive query expansion (AQE) framework that incorporates contextualized query embeddings and relevance feedback to refine the query representation. Our experiments on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset demonstrate that AQE significantly improves the retrieval performance of neural models, especially for complex and ambiguous queries. We also analyze the impact of AQE on different types of queries and provide insights into its effectiveness.
