Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes an adaptive query optimization framework that leverages machine learning to predict query execution plans. We develop a novel neural network architecture that incorporates query workload patterns, data distribution, and system resource utilization to optimize query planning. Experimental results on a real-world data warehousing benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves an average query response time reduction of 32% compared to traditional optimization techniques.
