Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by limitations in speech recognition, cognitive load, and accessibility. This study explores the design of inclusive voice assistants tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a multimodal interaction study, involving 30 participants aged 65+, to investigate the effects of visual and tactile cues on interaction accuracy and user experience. Our results show that the proposed design reduces errors by 32% and improves user satisfaction by 25%. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of accessible voice assistants and provide design recommendations for future systems.
