Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel neural topic modeling approach, dubbed 'NeuQE', which leverages deep learning to learn semantic relationships between query terms and expand the query space. We incorporate a probabilistic topic model to capture latent topic structures in the document collection and generate expanded queries that better match user intent. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that NeuQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of MAP and NDCG@20.
