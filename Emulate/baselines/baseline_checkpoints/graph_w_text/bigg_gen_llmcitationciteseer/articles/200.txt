Traditional query expansion techniques rely on handcrafted features and heuristics, often failing to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. We propose a neural query expansion approach that leverages hierarchical graph attention to model the contextual dependencies between query terms and their relevance to the target document. Our model, HierGATE, learns to recursively refine the query representation by aggregating attention weights across multiple graph layers. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness to query ambiguity.
