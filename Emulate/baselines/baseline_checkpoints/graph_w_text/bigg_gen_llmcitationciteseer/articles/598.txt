The proliferation of IoT devices and big data has created a pressing need for real-time analytics. Distributed column stores have emerged as a promising solution, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents 'Raptor', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning to predict query execution times and optimize query plans. Raptor incorporates a cost-based optimizer, a query execution time predictor, and a feedback loop to continuously refine its optimization strategies. Experimental results on a 100-node cluster demonstrate that Raptor reduces query latency by up to 3x compared to existing state-of-the-art optimizers, making it an attractive solution for real-time analytics workloads.
