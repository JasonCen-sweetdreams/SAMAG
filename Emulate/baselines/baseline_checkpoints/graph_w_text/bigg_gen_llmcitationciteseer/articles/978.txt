Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using machine learning techniques. We develop a query plan prediction model that leverages historical query execution data to forecast optimal execution plans for new queries. Our approach incorporates advanced feature engineering techniques, including query graph embedding and workload characterization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach reduces query execution time by up to 30% compared to traditional query optimization methods.
