Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to revolutionize the way people interact with their surroundings, but existing AR systems often neglect the needs of users with visual impairments. This paper presents an exploratory study on designing accessible AR experiences for visually impaired users. We conducted co-design workshops with visually impaired participants to identify key challenges and opportunities for inclusive AR design. Our findings inform the development of a novel AR prototype that incorporates audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized accessibility features. A user study with 20 visually impaired participants demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach in enhancing AR accessibility.
