Individuals with motor impairments often face challenges interacting with digital systems. We present an adaptive gesture recognition system that leverages machine learning and computer vision to accommodate diverse motor abilities. Our approach combines a wearable sensor with a deep neural network to recognize gestures, and incorporates a novel transfer learning mechanism to adapt to individual users' motor patterns. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
