In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to allocate tasks to heterogeneous agents with varying capabilities and preferences. Our method, called 'AgentQL', uses a decentralized, model-free algorithm that learns to optimize task assignments based on agent interactions and environmental feedback. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that AgentQL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
