This paper addresses the task allocation problem in decentralized multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and resources need to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) framework that enables agents to locally negotiate and allocate tasks while respecting global constraints. Our approach utilizes a decentralized graph-based representation of the task allocation problem, which allows agents to efficiently exchange information and converge to a near-optimal solution. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task allocation efficiency and robustness compared to centralized methods.
