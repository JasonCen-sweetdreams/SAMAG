Few-shot image classification tasks require models to adapt quickly to new classes with limited data. This paper presents a novel deep meta-learning approach, 'TaskAware', which learns to adapt task-aware metrics for few-shot classification. Our method leverages a hierarchical neural network to learn a task-agnostic embedding space and a task-aware metric space. The task-aware metric space is adapted using a meta-learning objective that minimizes the classification loss on a few labeled examples. We evaluate TaskAware on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and improved robustness to task variations.
