This study explores the role of embodiment in virtual reality (VR) experiences, examining how users' sense of agency and presence is influenced by avatar design and interaction modalities. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 40 participants, manipulating avatar realism and tracking systems. Our results show that users' embodiment perception is significantly enhanced by realistic avatars and full-body tracking, leading to increased feelings of presence and enjoyment. However, we also found that users' sense of agency is more strongly tied to controller-based interactions. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems and applications, highlighting the importance of embodiment in creating immersive and engaging experiences.
