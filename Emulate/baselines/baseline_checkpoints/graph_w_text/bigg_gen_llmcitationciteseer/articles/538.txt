Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but the impact of embodiment on user experience remains poorly understood. This study examines how embodiment, or the sense of owning a virtual body, affects user engagement, presence, and task performance in VR. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR platform with varying levels of embodiment. Results show that increased embodiment leads to higher user engagement, presence, and task performance, but also increases simulator sickness. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems that prioritize user experience.
