Distributed database systems (DDBS) have become increasingly prevalent in modern data processing. However, optimizing join orders in DDBS remains a challenging task due to the complexities of data distribution and network communication. This paper proposes a novel query rewriting framework, 'QRewrite', which leverages machine learning-based join order optimization techniques to minimize query execution time. We introduce a cost-based model that incorporates both data locality and network latency factors, enabling QRewrite to generate efficient join orders that reduce query latency by up to 30% compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental results on a real-world DDBS demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of QRewrite.
