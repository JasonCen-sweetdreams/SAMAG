Time-series databases (TSDBs) are increasingly used in IoT, finance, and healthcare applications, requiring efficient indexing methods for real-time query processing. This paper presents 'AdaptiX', a novel indexing approach that combines a hierarchical, grid-based indexing structure with an adaptive sampling technique. AdaptiX dynamically adjusts the sampling rate based on query patterns, achieving a 3x improvement in query latency and a 2x reduction in storage overhead compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods. We evaluate AdaptiX on a large-scale IoT dataset and demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness in supporting real-time analytics workloads.
