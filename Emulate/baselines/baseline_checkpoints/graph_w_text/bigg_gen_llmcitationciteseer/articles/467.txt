Real-time traffic signal control is a complex problem that requires adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework, 'TrafficMAX', which leverages cooperative learning to optimize traffic signal phases in real-time. Our approach integrates graph neural networks with deep Q-networks to model traffic patterns and learn optimal policies. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network show that TrafficMAX outperforms traditional signal control methods, reducing average travel time by 23.4% and increasing network throughput by 17.2%. We also demonstrate the scalability of our approach in a real-world deployment.
