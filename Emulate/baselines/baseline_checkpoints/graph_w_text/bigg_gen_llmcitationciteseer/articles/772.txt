Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in information retrieval, where the goal is to identify the correct entity referred to by a mention in unstructured text. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings and attention-based neural networks to disambiguate entities. We introduce a graph attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant entities and their relationships in the knowledge graph, improving disambiguation accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
