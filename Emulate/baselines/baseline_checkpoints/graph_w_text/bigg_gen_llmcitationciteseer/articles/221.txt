Materialized views (MVs) have been widely adopted in column-store databases to improve query performance. However, maintaining and querying MVs can be computationally expensive. This paper presents a novel approach, called 'MV-Opt', which leverages statistical models to predict the optimal query plan for MV maintenance and query processing. Our method considers the database workload, data distribution, and storage constraints to select the most efficient query plan. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that MV-Opt outperforms existing methods, reducing query latency by up to 50% and improving data freshness by up to 30%.
