Distributed relational databases face significant challenges in optimizing complex queries. Traditional optimization methods rely on hand-tuned heuristics or exhaustive search, leading to suboptimal performance and high latency. This paper presents a novel approach, 'RL-Opt', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed databases. We design a Markov decision process to model the query optimization problem and train an agent using deep Q-learning to select efficient query plans. Experimental results on a realistic workload demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
