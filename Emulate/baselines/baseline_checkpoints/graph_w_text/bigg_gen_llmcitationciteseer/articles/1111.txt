The proliferation of multi-modal data has created new challenges for efficient information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNN), which leverages the strengths of graph neural networks and hierarchical clustering to facilitate fast and accurate retrieval of multi-modal data. Our approach represents data as a hierarchical graph, where each node corresponds to a data instance, and edges capture semantic relationships between instances. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and accuracy, while also providing interpretable results.
