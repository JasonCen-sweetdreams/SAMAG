Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in node classification tasks, but most existing methods rely on transductive learning, which requires access to the entire graph during training. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, HAGNN, that enables inductive node classification. HAGNN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant neighboring nodes and subgraphs, allowing it to generalize well to unseen graphs. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in inductive node classification tasks, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 5.2%.
