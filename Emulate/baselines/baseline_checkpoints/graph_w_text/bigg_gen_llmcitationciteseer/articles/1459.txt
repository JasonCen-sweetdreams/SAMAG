Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a crucial step in various natural language processing and artificial intelligence applications. However, entity disambiguation remains a significant challenge in KGE, as it directly affects the accuracy of subsequent tasks. This paper proposes a novel graph-based neural network approach, called GraphED, to tackle entity disambiguation in KGE. GraphED leverages the graph structure of knowledge graphs to learn entity representations that capture both semantic and relational information. We evaluate GraphED on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in entity disambiguation and KGE tasks.
