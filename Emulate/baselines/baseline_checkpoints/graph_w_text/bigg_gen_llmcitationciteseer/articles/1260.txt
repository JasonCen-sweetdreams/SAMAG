Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems aim to retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus to answer user queries. However, existing dense passage retrieval (DPR) methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation (HDR) approach that leverages both local and global contextualized embeddings to efficiently encode documents. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR achieves comparable retrieval performance to state-of-the-art DPR models while reducing computational overhead by 30% and memory usage by 50%
