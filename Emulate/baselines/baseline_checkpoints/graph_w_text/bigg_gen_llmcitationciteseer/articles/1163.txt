Query expansion is a crucial technique in e-commerce search to improve retrieval accuracy. Existing methods rely on manual feature engineering or simple heuristics, which may not generalize well across diverse product domains. We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'QLX', which learns to adaptively expand queries based on user behavior and feedback. QLX uses a deep Q-network to select the most relevant expansion terms, and incorporates a reward function that balances precision and recall. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that QLX outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12.5% increase in mean average precision.
