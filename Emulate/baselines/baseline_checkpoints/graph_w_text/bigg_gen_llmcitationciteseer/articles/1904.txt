In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and fair negotiation mechanisms. This paper proposes a decentralized framework for task allocation, where agents negotiate through bilateral agreements to maximize their individual utilities. We introduce a novel protocol, 'ANT', which incorporates a combination of auction-based and voting-based mechanisms to achieve Pareto optimality. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that ANT outperforms existing centralized and decentralized methods in terms of allocation efficiency and agent satisfaction.
