Coalition formation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to form groups to achieve common goals. Existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering or exhaustive search, which can be computationally expensive and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel approach, Adaptive Coalition Formation with Graph Attention Networks (ACF-GAT), which leverages graph attention mechanisms to learn effective coalition structures from agent features and interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ACF-GAT in various simulated environments, including disaster response and resource allocation scenarios, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of coalition quality and computational efficiency.
