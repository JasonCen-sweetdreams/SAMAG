Distributed database systems face significant challenges in optimizing query execution plans, leading to suboptimal performance and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed settings. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', learns to adapt to changing workload patterns and database dynamics, outperforming traditional cost-based optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization.
