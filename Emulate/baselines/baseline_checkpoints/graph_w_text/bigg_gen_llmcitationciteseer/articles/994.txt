Individuals with visual impairments often face significant barriers when interacting with digital systems. This study investigates the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in alleviating cognitive load for visually impaired users. We designed an ECA-based interface that employs multimodal feedback and evaluated its effectiveness in a usability study with 20 participants. Results show that the ECA-based system significantly reduces cognitive load and improves task completion times compared to traditional screen-reader-based interfaces. We also found that users' perceived satisfaction and confidence in using the system increased with the ECA's presence.
