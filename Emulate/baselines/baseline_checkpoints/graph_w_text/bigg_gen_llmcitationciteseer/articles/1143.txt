Individuals with color vision deficiency (CVD) often struggle to interpret visualizations that rely on color cues. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible visualizations that are optimized for users with CVD. We conducted a user study to identify common visualization pitfalls and developed a set of guidelines for creating CVD-friendly visualizations. Our approach leverages machine learning-based color palette optimization and adaptive visualization rendering to ensure that visualizations are perceivable and understandable by users with CVD. Evaluation results show significant improvement in visualization comprehension and user experience.
