Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed database systems, and join order selection is a key component of this process. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, but these methods can be suboptimal or computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to optimize join order selection. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to select the optimal join order by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query performance. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
