Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance older adults' quality of life, but existing systems often struggle to accommodate users with motor impairments. This paper presents a participatory design approach to develop an inclusive gesture recognition system tailored to the needs of older adults with motor impairments. We conducted co-design workshops with 15 older adults and 5 caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our proposed system, 'EasyGesture', utilizes machine learning algorithms to recognize gestures from skeletal data, and incorporates adaptive feedback mechanisms to assist users with varying motor abilities. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates that EasyGesture achieves higher gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
