Entity retrieval is a crucial component of many information retrieval systems. However, the performance of these systems is often hindered by the vocabulary mismatch problem. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between entities. Our approach, dubbed NeuroQE, uses a graph-based neural network to learn entity representations and expand queries with relevant terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall.
