Few-shot relation extraction (FSRE) is a challenging task that requires models to generalize to new relations with limited labeled data. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages graph structure to model complex relationships between entities. HGAT consists of a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both local and global context, and a graph-based meta-learning approach that adapts to new relations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in FSRE, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 4.5%. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in real-world applications such as knowledge graph construction.
