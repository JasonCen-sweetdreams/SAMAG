Multi-agent systems operating in dynamic environments require effective negotiation strategies to achieve cooperative goals. This paper presents a novel autonomous negotiation framework, 'DynaNeg', which integrates machine learning and game theory to adapt to changing environmental conditions. DynaNeg employs a deep reinforcement learning approach to learn negotiation strategies from historical data and updates them in real-time using a graph-based attention mechanism. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DynaNeg outperforms existing negotiation strategies in terms of cooperation rate, conflict resolution, and overall system utility.
