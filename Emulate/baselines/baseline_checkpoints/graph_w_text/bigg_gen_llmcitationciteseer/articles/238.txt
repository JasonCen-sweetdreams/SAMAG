Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for pseudo-relevance feedback, which leverages a neural ranking model to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our method, dubbed 'NeuroPRF', learns to identify relevant documents and extracts informative terms using a multi-task learning framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroPRF outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
