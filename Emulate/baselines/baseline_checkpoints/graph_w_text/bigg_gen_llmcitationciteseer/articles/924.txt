Sparse document retrieval remains a challenging problem in information retrieval, especially when dealing with short queries and few relevant documents. This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HierRank, which leverages both local and global contextual information to improve retrieval accuracy. Our model consists of a query-document interaction module and a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures complex relationships between query terms and document entities. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierRank significantly outperforms state-of-the-art sparse retrieval models, achieving a relative improvement of up to 15% in mean average precision.
