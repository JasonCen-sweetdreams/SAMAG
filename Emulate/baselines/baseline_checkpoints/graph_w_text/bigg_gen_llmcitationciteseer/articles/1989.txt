The increasing scale and complexity of distributed relational databases necessitate efficient query optimization techniques to minimize response times and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to predict optimal query plans. We develop a graph neural network (GNN) that learns to represent query plans as graphs and predicts the most efficient plan based on historical query execution data. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time, while maintaining comparable accuracy.
