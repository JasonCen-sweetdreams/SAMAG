Relevance feedback is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it enables users to provide explicit judgments on retrieved documents, leading to improved search results. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to document filtering, which leverages user feedback to adaptively update the retrieval model. Our method, dubbed 'DeepRF', incorporates a neural network to learn a document representation that integrates both semantic and relevance information. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepRF significantly outperforms traditional relevance feedback methods, achieving higher precision and recall rates while reducing the number of required feedback iterations.
