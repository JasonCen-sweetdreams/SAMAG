Query expansion is a crucial step in search engines to improve retrieval performance. However, existing methods often rely on term co-occurrence statistics or knowledge graphs, which can be computationally expensive and prone to overfitting. We propose a novel approach, HierDoc, which leverages hierarchical document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between documents and queries. By representing documents as hierarchical compositions of semantic concepts, we enable efficient query expansion through a combination of semantic matching and relevance feedback. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
