Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data management. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query optimization, which models the distributed database system as a graph and leverages graph algorithms to identify optimal query plans. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and reduces communication overhead by up to 25%. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the optimality of our approach.
