With the increasing scale and complexity of modern database systems, efficient data retrieval has become a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical hash index (HHI) that leverages the principles of distributed hash tables to facilitate fast and scalable data retrieval in distributed database systems. Our HHI scheme exploits the hierarchical structure of the index to reduce the number of network hops required for data retrieval, resulting in improved query performance and reduced latency. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing indexing schemes in terms of query response time and system throughput.
