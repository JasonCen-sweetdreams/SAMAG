Effective retrieval of relevant documents in search engines relies on accurately identifying the intent behind a user query. While existing approaches rely on manual annotation or supervised learning, we propose an unsupervised method using Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGATs). Our approach models the query-document interaction as a graph, where entities and keywords are nodes, and their relationships are edges. HGATs enable the capture of complex contextual dependencies between entities, leading to improved intent identification. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods.
