RDF (Resource Description Framework) graphs have become a standard for representing large-scale semantic data. However, querying and indexing these graphs in real-time remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'RDFlex', a novel indexing framework that leverages a combination of graph summarization and dynamic partitioning to achieve efficient query processing. Our approach enables scalable and adaptive indexing of RDF graphs, supporting a wide range of query patterns and graph workloads. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that RDFlex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage efficiency.
