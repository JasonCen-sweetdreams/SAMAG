Neural architecture search (NAS) has emerged as a promising paradigm for automating the design of deep neural networks. However, existing NAS methods often rely on complex, computationally expensive search algorithms. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph-based encoding (HG-Encode) for efficient NAS. By representing neural architectures as hierarchical graphs, we can leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a compact, discrete encoding space. Experimental results on popular NAS benchmarks demonstrate that HG-Encode achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing search time by up to 75% compared to existing methods.
