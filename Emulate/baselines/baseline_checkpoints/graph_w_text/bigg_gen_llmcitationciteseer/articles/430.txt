Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its accessibility for users with disabilities remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR interfaces that cater to users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with users with disabilities and developed a set of accessibility guidelines for VR interface design. Our results show that the proposed guidelines significantly improve the usability and user experience of VR systems for users with disabilities.
