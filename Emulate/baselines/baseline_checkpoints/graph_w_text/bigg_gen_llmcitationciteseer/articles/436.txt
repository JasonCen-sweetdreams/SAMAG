Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval systems, but it can be computationally expensive and may not generalize well to unseen queries. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural query expansion approach, 'HNQE', which leverages a multi-level attention mechanism to selectively incorporate relevant terms from the document collection. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, while also providing interpretable query representations.
