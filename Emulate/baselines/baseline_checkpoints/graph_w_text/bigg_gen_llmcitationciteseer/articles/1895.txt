Coordinating multiple agents in complex environments is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. We propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (H-DRL) framework to tackle this challenge. Our approach consists of a high-level coordinator that learns to assign tasks to agents and a low-level learner that optimizes individual agent policies. We evaluate our method in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario and demonstrate improved coordination and task completion rates compared to existing decentralized DRL methods.
