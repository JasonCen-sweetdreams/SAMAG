Distributed data warehouses (DDWs) have become essential for big data analytics. However, incremental view maintenance (IVM) in DDWs remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel delta-based IVM approach, DeltaIVM, which leverages the concept of deltas to efficiently maintain materialized views in a distributed setting. DeltaIVM utilizes a hierarchical architecture to process deltas in parallel, reducing the communication overhead and improving the maintenance performance. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, demonstrating that DeltaIVM outperforms existing IVM approaches in terms of maintenance time and data freshness.
