Retrieval efficiency remains a significant challenge in specialized domains, where query intent is often complex and nuanced. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework, 'NQE-Specialist', that leverages domain-specific knowledge graphs to generate context-aware query representations. Our approach involves training a graph neural network to learn domain-specific entity relationships and incorporating these into a probabilistic query expansion model. Experimental results on a biomedical dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and F1-score compared to traditional keyword-based expansion methods.
