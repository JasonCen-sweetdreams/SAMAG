High-dimensional data is becoming increasingly prevalent in various domains, posing significant challenges to efficient data storage and querying in cloud-based database systems. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'HDI-Tree', which leverages the inherent sparsity of high-dimensional data to reduce storage overhead and improve query performance. Our approach exploits the correlation between attributes to compress index structures and facilitates fast similarity searches using a hierarchical clustering-based approach. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HDI-Tree outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of storage efficiency, query throughput, and scalability.
