This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation approach for multi-agent systems, leveraging auction-based mechanisms to efficiently allocate tasks among agents. Our proposed method, called Distributed Auction-based Task Allocation (DATA), utilizes a decentralized Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction to incentivize agents to reveal their true capabilities and preferences. We prove that DATA is strategy-proof, ensuring that agents have no incentive to misreport their capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated multi-agent system demonstrate that DATA outperforms existing centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and system efficiency.
