Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to retrieve relevant documents due to the lexical gap between query terms and document content. This paper proposes a novel relevance-based document expansion approach, 'RDE', which selectively incorporates relevant terms from top-ranked documents into the original query. Our method leverages a neural ranking model to estimate the relevance of each term and adaptively adjusts the expansion weights based on the query's semantic context. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 datasets demonstrate that RDE significantly improves retrieval accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
