Neural search engines have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but they often struggle with query formulation. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using pseudo-relevance feedback, which leverages the neural model's own uncertainty to identify relevant terms. Our method, dubbed 'NeuroQE', adaptively selects expansion terms based on the model's confidence scores and relevance estimates. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, improving both precision and recall by up to 15%.
