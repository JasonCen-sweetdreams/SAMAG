Time series data is increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can have devastating consequences in applications such as finance and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel graph-based neural network (GNN) architecture, 'TS-Guard', for detecting adversarial attacks in time series data. TS-Guard leverages the graph structure of time series data to identify anomalous patterns and uses a combination of spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to improve detection accuracy. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-Guard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting both targeted and untargeted attacks.
