Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the retrieval accuracy. Traditional query expansion methods rely on term co-occurrence statistics, which may not capture the nuanced relationships between terms in a query. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'CAQE', which leverages context-aware embeddings to model the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness.
