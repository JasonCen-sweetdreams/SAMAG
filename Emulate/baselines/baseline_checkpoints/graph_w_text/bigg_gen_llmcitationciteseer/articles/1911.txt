Individuals with dyslexia often face barriers when interacting with conversational interfaces, such as chatbots and voice assistants. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create more inclusive conversational interfaces for people with dyslexia. We conducted a mixed-methods study, involving surveys, interviews, and usability testing, to identify the specific challenges and needs of this population. Our findings inform the development of a set of design guidelines and a prototype system that incorporates adaptations such as text-to-speech, phonetic spell-checking, and semantic error correction. Evaluation results show significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates for participants with dyslexia.
