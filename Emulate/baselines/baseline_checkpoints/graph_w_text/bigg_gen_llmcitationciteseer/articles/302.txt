Optimizing database queries is crucial for efficient data retrieval in distributed databases. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, which can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, called 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal plan from a set of possible plans, taking into account the database's dynamic workload and resource constraints. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that RL-QOpt achieves an average speedup of 2.5x over state-of-the-art optimization techniques while reducing the optimization time by 75%.
