Real-time resource allocation is a critical problem in many applications, including smart grids, traffic management, and cloud computing. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems using distributed reinforcement learning (DRL). Our method, called 'DRIMA', leverages a decentralized actor-critic architecture to enable agents to learn cooperative policies for resource allocation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DRIMA in a realistic simulation environment, showing significant improvements in response time, resource utilization, and overall system efficiency compared to traditional centralized optimization methods.
