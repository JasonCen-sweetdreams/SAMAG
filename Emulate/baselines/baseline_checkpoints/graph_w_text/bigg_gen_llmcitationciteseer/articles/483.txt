Urban traffic control is a complex problem that requires coordinating multiple agents to optimize traffic flow. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to train a multi-agent system for autonomous traffic control. We introduce a decentralized, hierarchical framework that enables agents to learn from local observations and communicate with each other to achieve global optimization. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional, rule-based methods in terms of reducing congestion and travel time.
