Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture user intent, particularly when queries are short or ambiguous. This paper proposes a neural relevance modeling approach to query expansion, dubbed 'NeuQE'. By learning to predict relevance scores for candidate expansion terms, NeuQE dynamically adapts to the query context and document collection. Our experiments on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, with an average increase of 12.5% in mean average precision compared to state-of-the-art expansion methods.
