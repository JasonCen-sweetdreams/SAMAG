Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly popular for handling massive datasets, but optimizing query performance in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our method, 'QueryOptRL', leverages a DRL agent to learn an optimal query plan policy from a large dataset of query-execution experiences. We evaluate QueryOptRL on a real-world DDS benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
