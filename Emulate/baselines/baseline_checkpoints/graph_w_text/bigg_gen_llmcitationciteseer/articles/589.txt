Voice assistants have the potential to support older adults' independence, but existing designs often neglect their unique needs and abilities. This paper presents a participatory study with 20 older adults, exploring their experiences and preferences with voice assistants. We identify key challenges, such as difficulties with voice recognition, language complexity, and discoverability of features. Based on our findings, we propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants, including personalized voice profiles, simplified language, and multimodal feedback. Our study contributes to the development of more accessible and usable voice assistants for older adults.
