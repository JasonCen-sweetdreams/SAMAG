Knowledge graph embedding has emerged as a crucial task in various applications, including question answering and recommender systems. However, existing methods struggle to effectively model complex relationships between entities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework, which leverages multi-relational knowledge graphs to learn rich entity representations. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant relational patterns, enabling more accurate and interpretable embeddings. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in link prediction and entity classification tasks.
