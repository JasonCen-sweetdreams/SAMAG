Graph-based recommendation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various domains. However, their lack of interpretability hinders their adoption in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to provide insights into the recommendation process. HGAT consists of two stages: a local attention module that captures item relationships and a global attention module that aggregates user preferences. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that HGAT outperforms existing graph-based models while providing interpretable recommendations through visualized attention patterns.
