In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model complex agent interactions. Our approach, called 'Distributed Task Allocator with GCNs' (DTA-GCN), uses GCNs to learn a representation of the agent communication graph and then allocates tasks based on the learned representation. We evaluate DTA-GCN on a variety of benchmark problems and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving near-optimal task allocations compared to state-of-the-art centralized methods.
