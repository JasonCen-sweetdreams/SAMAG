The increasing adoption of RDF graph databases in large-scale data integration and knowledge graph applications has led to a growing need for efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents a novel, scalable query optimization framework for distributed RDF graph databases. Our approach leverages a combination of graph partitioning, query rewriting, and parallel execution to reduce query latency and improve system throughput. We evaluate our framework on a cluster of 16 machines using the LUBM benchmark and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
