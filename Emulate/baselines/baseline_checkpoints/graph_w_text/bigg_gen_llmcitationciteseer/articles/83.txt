The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential growth in time-series data, posing significant challenges for database systems. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'TS-Index', designed specifically for main-memory column-store databases. TS-Index leverages a combination of bit-packing, delta-encoding, and sampling to reduce storage overhead and improve query performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TS-Index outperforms existing indexing methods, achieving up to 3x faster query execution and 2x better storage efficiency.
