Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but individuals with speech impairments often face difficulties interacting with these systems. This paper presents a novel approach to personalized accent recognition for voice assistants, focusing on users with cerebral palsy and Down syndrome. Our proposed framework, 'AccentAdapt', integrates a deep learning-based accent recognition model with a user profiling system, enabling the voice assistant to adapt to individual speech patterns. A user study with 30 participants reveals significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction using AccentAdapt, demonstrating the potential for more inclusive voice assistants.
