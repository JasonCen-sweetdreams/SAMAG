As distributed database systems (DDS) become increasingly prevalent, ensuring consistency and concurrency control across multiple nodes remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) protocol, 'DynaVer', designed to scale with the growing demands of modern DDS. DynaVer leverages a hybrid approach, combining optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control techniques to minimize aborts and reduce latency. Our evaluation on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrates that DynaVer outperforms existing MVCC protocols, achieving up to 30% improvement in transaction throughput and 25% reduction in latency.
