Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely heavily on effective query representation to retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach for query expansion, dubbed 'NeuroQE'. NeuroQE learns to predict context-aware query terms by modeling the semantic relationships between query keywords and the document collection. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, including RM3 and PRF, in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain. Furthermore, we show that NeuroQE can be seamlessly integrated into existing retrieval systems, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.
