Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent in various applications, including virtual assistants and smart home devices. While personalization is often touted as a key factor in enhancing user experience, its impact on user engagement in voice-based interfaces remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study that explores the effects of personalization on user engagement in voice-based interfaces. Our results show that personalized voice responses can significantly increase user engagement, but only when the personalization is perceived as relevant and accurate. We also identify several design implications for creating more engaging voice-based interfaces, including the importance of transparent personalization mechanisms and user control over personalized features.
