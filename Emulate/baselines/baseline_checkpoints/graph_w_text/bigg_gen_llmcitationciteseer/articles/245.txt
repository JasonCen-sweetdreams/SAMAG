Real-time data warehousing requires efficient query optimization to handle large volumes of data. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to optimize query performance. We develop a novel query classification model that predicts the optimal execution plan based on query features and historical query patterns. Our approach reduces query latency by up to 30% compared to traditional optimization techniques. We also propose a dynamic re-optimization strategy that adapts to changing data distributions and query workloads. Experimental results on a real-world data warehousing dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving query performance and reducing resource utilization.
