This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous agent coordination for real-time resource allocation in smart cities. We introduce a decentralized multi-agent system that utilizes artificial potential fields to coordinate agents' actions and optimize resource allocation in dynamic environments. Our approach is evaluated through simulations of a smart traffic management system, demonstrating improved response times and reduced congestion compared to traditional centralized approaches. The proposed framework has significant implications for the efficient management of urban resources and services.
