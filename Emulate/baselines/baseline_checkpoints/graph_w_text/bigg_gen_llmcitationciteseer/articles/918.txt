Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, where the join order enumeration problem is a major bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize join order enumeration. We introduce a deep Q-network-based agent that learns to select the optimal join order by interacting with the database system. Our approach, called 'RLJOIN', outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and reduces the number of unnecessary joins. We evaluate RLJOIN on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving query performance.
