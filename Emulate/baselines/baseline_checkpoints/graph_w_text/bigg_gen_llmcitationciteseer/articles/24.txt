This paper presents a novel gesture recognition system designed specifically for older adults with dementia. Our approach incorporates machine learning algorithms and cognitive models to adapt to the unique needs and abilities of this population. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that our system achieved an average recognition accuracy of 92%, outperforming existing systems. We also explored the role of cognitive load in gesture recognition and provide design recommendations for future systems. Our work has implications for the development of assistive technologies that support independence and quality of life for older adults with dementia.
