The increasing volume of online documents has made efficient document retrieval a crucial component in modern search engines. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural re-ranking approach, 'HNR', which leverages the strengths of both lexical and semantic matching techniques. HNR first employs a coarse-grained lexical matching module to filter out irrelevant documents, followed by a fine-grained semantic re-ranking module that incorporates contextualized embeddings. Experimental results on the TREC Deep Learning Track dataset demonstrate that HNR outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency.
