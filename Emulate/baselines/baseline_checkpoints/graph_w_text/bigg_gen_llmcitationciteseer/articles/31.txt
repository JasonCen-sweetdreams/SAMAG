As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for explainable AI decision-making processes grows. This paper presents Graph Attention Reinforcement Learning (GARL), a novel framework that integrates graph attention networks with reinforcement learning to provide transparent and interpretable decision-making for autonomous systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GARL in a real-world robotics navigation task, showing improved performance and explainability compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods. Additionally, we provide a thorough analysis of the learned graph attention mechanisms, revealing insights into the decision-making process.
