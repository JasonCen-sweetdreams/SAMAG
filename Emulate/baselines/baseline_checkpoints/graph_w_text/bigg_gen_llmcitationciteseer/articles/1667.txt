Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture query intent, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel query expansion approach, HDE-QE, which leverages hierarchical document embeddings to represent complex document relationships. Our method generates a hierarchical graph of document embeddings, enabling the identification of latent topics and semantic associations. This allows for more accurate and diverse query expansion, improving retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and recall over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
