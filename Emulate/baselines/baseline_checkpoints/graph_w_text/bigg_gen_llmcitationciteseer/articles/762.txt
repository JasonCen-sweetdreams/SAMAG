Zero-shot learning (ZSL) has gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for ZSL, which enables explainable predictions by highlighting the most relevant semantic features. Our HAN model consists of two attention modules: a semantic attention module that learns to attend to relevant class semantics, and a visual attention module that focuses on discriminative regions in the input image. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art ZSL methods in terms of both accuracy and explainability.
