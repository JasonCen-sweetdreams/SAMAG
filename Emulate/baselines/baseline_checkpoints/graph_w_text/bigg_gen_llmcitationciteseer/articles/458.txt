Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems often struggle to capture the nuances of medical terminology, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages word embeddings and pseudo-relevance feedback to improve the accuracy of MIR systems. Our method, MedQE, uses word2vec to generate semantically similar terms for query expansion, and then incorporates pseudo-relevance feedback to re-rank the expanded query terms based on their relevance to the top-ranked documents. Experimental results on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset demonstrate that MedQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
