Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but the impact of embodied avatars on user experience remains poorly understood. This study investigates how the design of embodied avatars influences user presence, agency, and overall experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, and behavioral data. Our results show that users who interacted with more humanoid avatars reported higher levels of presence and agency, while those with more abstract avatars reported increased feelings of frustration. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of embodied avatars in VR applications.
