Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) architecture that leverages graph-structured user-item interactions to generate personalized recommendations with transparent explanations. Our model integrates node-level and graph-level attention mechanisms to identify influential users and items, and learns to explain recommendations by highlighting relevant interaction patterns. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
