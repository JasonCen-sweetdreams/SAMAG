Temporal graphs have become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including social networks, IoT, and financial transactions. However, querying these graphs in real-time remains a significant challenge due to their large size and dynamic nature. This paper presents 'ChronoOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages graph summarization and incremental indexing techniques to accelerate query execution on temporal graphs. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ChronoOpt outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by up to 5x in terms of query response time, while maintaining high accuracy and supporting a wide range of analytics queries.
