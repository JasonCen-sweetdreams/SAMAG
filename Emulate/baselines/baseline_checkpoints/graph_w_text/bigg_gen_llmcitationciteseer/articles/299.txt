Multi-modal retrieval in hierarchical document collections is a challenging problem due to the complexity of indexing and querying diverse media types. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'Hierarchical Modal Index' (HMI), which leverages the structure of hierarchical collections to efficiently integrate and query multiple modalities. HMI employs a hybrid indexing approach, combining inverted indices for text and feature-based indices for images and audio. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HMI on a large-scale dataset, achieving significant improvements in query performance and reducing the storage overhead compared to existing approaches.
