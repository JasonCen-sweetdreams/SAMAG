This paper proposes a neural query expansion (NQE) framework to enhance the retrieval effectiveness of ad-hoc search systems. We leverage a combination of word embeddings and neural language models to generate context-aware expansion terms that capture the semantic intent of the original query. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate that our NQE approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalised discounted cumulative gain.
