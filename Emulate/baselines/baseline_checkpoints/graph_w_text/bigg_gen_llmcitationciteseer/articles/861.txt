Main-memory databases have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics and transactional workloads. However, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck, particularly for complex queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization that leverages learned index structures, which can adapt to the underlying data distribution and workload patterns. We introduce a hierarchical indexing framework that integrates traditional B-tree indexes with learned models, enabling efficient query execution and optimization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
