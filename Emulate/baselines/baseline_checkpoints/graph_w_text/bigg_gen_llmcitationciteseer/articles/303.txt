In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a decentralized framework, 'MARL-TA', where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities, availability, and environmental conditions. Our approach leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture, combining both local and global rewards to optimize task allocation. Experimental results in a simulated warehouse scenario demonstrate that MARL-TA outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods, achieving a 25% increase in overall system efficiency and a 30% reduction in task completion time.
