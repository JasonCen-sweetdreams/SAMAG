Short-text queries are ubiquitous in e-commerce search, but their brevity often leads to poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a context-aware query expansion framework that leverages product metadata, user behavior, and query intent to generate more informative queries. Our approach incorporates a graph-based method to model the relationships between query terms, products, and users, and a reinforcement learning strategy to optimize the expansion process. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in recall and precision over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
