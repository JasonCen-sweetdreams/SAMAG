Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval that aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, HQE-NR, which leverages a neural ranking model to select the most informative expansion terms. Our approach combines the strengths of both lexical and semantic expansion methods, reducing the dimensionality of the expanded query space while preserving the relevance of top-ranked documents. Experimental results on the TREC AP dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
