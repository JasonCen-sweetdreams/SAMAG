The growing popularity of RDF data has led to an increasing need for efficient query processing mechanisms. This paper addresses the problem of indexing large RDF graphs to support scalable query execution. We propose a novel indexing approach, 'RDF-Index', which leverages a combination of graph partitioning and compression techniques to reduce storage overhead. Our experiments on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that RDF-Index outperforms existing indexing methods in terms of query response time and memory usage, making it a viable solution for large-scale RDF data processing.
