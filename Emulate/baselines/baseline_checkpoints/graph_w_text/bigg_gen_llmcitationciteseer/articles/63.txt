Recommender systems are crucial in modern e-commerce, but scaling them to massive user-item graphs remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively aggregate node features across multiple graph scales. HGAT is designed to capture complex item relationships, model user preferences, and adapt to dynamic graph structures. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based recommenders in terms of precision, recall, and computational efficiency.
