Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various industries, but its adoption is hindered by user experience (UX) issues. This paper investigates the effects of personalization on UX in VR. We designed and implemented a VR system that adapts to users' preferences, abilities, and cognitive styles. A user study with 30 participants revealed significant improvements in user satisfaction, engagement, and task performance when personalized elements were introduced. Our results suggest that personalization can mitigate cybersickness, increase user confidence, and enhance overall UX in VR environments.
