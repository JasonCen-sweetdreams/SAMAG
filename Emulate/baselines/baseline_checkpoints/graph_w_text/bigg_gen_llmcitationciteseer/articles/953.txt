In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages asynchronous consensus protocols to enable agents to make collective decisions. Our approach, called 'AsyncTA', uses a combination of gossip-based consensus and distributed constraint optimization to allocate tasks to agents in a fair and efficient manner. We evaluate AsyncTA in simulated environments and demonstrate its robustness to agent failures, network partitions, and varying task loads. The results show that AsyncTA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of allocation quality, communication overhead, and convergence time.
