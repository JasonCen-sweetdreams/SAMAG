The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources in smart grids necessitates efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper proposes an intelligent agent-based framework for optimal resource allocation in distributed smart grids. The framework utilizes a multi-agent system, where each agent represents a distributed energy resource, and employs a decentralized decision-making approach based on reinforcement learning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in grid stability, reduces energy losses, and enhances overall system efficiency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
