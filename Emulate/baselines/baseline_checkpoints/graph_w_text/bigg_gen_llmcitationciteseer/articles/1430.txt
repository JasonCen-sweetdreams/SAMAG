In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient coordination among agents to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn cooperative task allocation strategies. Our method, called GraphTask, represents the agent-task graph as a neural network and learns to predict optimal task assignments based on agent capabilities and task requirements. We evaluate GraphTask on a suite of benchmark problems and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead compared to traditional approaches.
