Query optimization is a crucial component of modern database management systems, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of data-intensive applications. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize queries based on a reward function that balances execution time, resource utilization, and query complexity. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world database workload shows that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
