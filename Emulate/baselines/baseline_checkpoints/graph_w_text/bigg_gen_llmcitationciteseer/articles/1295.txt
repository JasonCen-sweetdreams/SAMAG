Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks, but their lack of transparency and interpretability hinders trust and adoption in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to learn feature importance and generate explainable classification results. Our experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that HAN outperforms existing attention-based methods in terms of accuracy and attribution quality, while providing insights into the decision-making process of the model.
