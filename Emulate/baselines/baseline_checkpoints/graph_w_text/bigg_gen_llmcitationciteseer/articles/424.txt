Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the requirements of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with 15 older adults, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings led to the development of 'ElderVoice', a voice assistant that incorporates age-related accommodations, such as slower speech recognition, personalized feedback, and simplified dialogue flows. A usability study with 10 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing commercial voice assistants.
