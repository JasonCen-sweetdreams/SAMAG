Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, but its vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises concerns about its reliability. This paper proposes a novel approach, AdvExp, which integrates adversarial experience replay into DRL to improve its robustness. We generate adversarial experiences through a minimax game between the agent and an attacker, and then replay them alongside the original experiences to augment the agent's training. Our experiments on Atari games and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that AdvExp significantly enhances the agent's robustness to various types of attacks, including white-box, black-box, and zero-shot attacks.
