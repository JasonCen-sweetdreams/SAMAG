Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, but its performance heavily relies on the careful tuning of hyperparameters. This process is typically time-consuming and computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale problems. We propose a novel approach, 'HyperBO', which leverages Bayesian optimization to efficiently search for optimal hyperparameters in DRL. By adopting a surrogate-based model and an acquisition function tailored to DRL's unique characteristics, HyperBO significantly reduces the number of evaluations required to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results on various Atari games and robotic control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
