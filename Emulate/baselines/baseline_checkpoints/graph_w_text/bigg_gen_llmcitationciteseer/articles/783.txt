This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing accessible gesture-based interfaces tailored to older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving co-design workshops, user testing, and survey questionnaires to identify the needs and preferences of our target population. Our proposed interface, 'EasyGesture', incorporates a range of adaptations, including personalized gesture recognition, error correction mechanisms, and real-time feedback. Evaluation results show that EasyGesture significantly improves the usability and accessibility of gesture-based interfaces for older adults with motor impairments, enabling them to interact more confidently and effectively with digital systems.
