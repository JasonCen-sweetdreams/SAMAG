Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in a given context. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph attention networks and knowledge graph embeddings to disambiguate entities. Our model, called GraphED, represents entities as nodes in a graph and utilizes attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of neighboring entities. We also incorporate knowledge graph embeddings to capture semantic relationships between entities. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and F1-score.
