In multi-tenant database systems, query optimization is crucial for efficient resource allocation and improved performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for diverse workloads. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict optimal query plans based on runtime statistics and database characteristics. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates significant improvements in query response time and system throughput compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
