Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with digital information. However, designing VR experiences that engage users remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of personalization in enhancing user engagement in VR. We conducted a user study involving 50 participants, where we manipulated the level of personalization in a VR environment and measured user engagement using physiological and behavioral metrics. Our results show that personalized VR experiences lead to increased user engagement, but only when personalized elements are relevant to the user's interests. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing more engaging VR experiences and highlight areas for future research.
