Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) approach to model the semantic relationships between passages and questions. Our HGNN architecture leverages both local and global contextual information to compute a dense representation of each passage, allowing for more accurate similarity measurements. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods, achieving a 12% improvement in top-1 accuracy and a 30% reduction in compute time.
