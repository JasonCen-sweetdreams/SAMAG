Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults, but existing VR interfaces often pose significant accessibility barriers. This paper presents a participatory co-design approach to developing accessible VR interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with 15 older adults and 5 VR designers, resulting in the development of 12 interface design guidelines. We evaluated these guidelines through a usability study with 20 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction. Our approach provides a foundation for designing inclusive VR interfaces that can be used by older adults with varying abilities.
