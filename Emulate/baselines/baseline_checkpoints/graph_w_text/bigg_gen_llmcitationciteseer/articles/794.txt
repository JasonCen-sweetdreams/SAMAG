This paper presents a novel gesture recognition system, 'EasyGesture', designed specifically for elderly users with cognitive impairments. EasyGesture employs a multimodal approach, combining computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize gestures. We propose an adaptive framework that dynamically adjusts the system's sensitivity and accuracy based on the user's cognitive abilities and environmental factors. A user study with 30 elderly participants demonstrated that EasyGesture significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems. Our findings suggest that EasyGesture has the potential to enhance the quality of life for elderly individuals with cognitive impairments.
