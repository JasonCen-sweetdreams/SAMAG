Despite their success, deep neural networks often lack transparency, hindering trust in AI-driven decision-making. This paper contributes to the growing field of explainable AI by proposing a meta-learning framework for adaptive explainability. Our approach, 'MetaXAI', leverages model-agnostic meta-learning to generate interpretable explanations for novel, unseen inputs. By adapting to the underlying data distribution, MetaXAI outperforms existing explainability methods in terms of fidelity, relevance, and computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaXAI on a range of image classification benchmarks, showcasing its potential for promoting trustworthy AI systems.
