Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when faced with limited training data. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach, Hierarchical Prototypical Networks (HPN), which leverages prototypical representations at multiple levels of abstraction. HPN adaptively selects and combines prototypes from a hierarchical memory to form a task-specific model, enabling few-shot learning with improved accuracy and flexibility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HPN on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet.
