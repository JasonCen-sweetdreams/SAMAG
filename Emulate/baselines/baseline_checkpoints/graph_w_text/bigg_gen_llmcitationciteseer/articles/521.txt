With the rapid growth of digital libraries, efficient document retrieval has become a pressing concern. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for retrieving relevant documents in large-scale collections. Our HAN model leverages a two-level attention mechanism to capture both local and global contextual information in documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods, particularly in terms of precision and recall at top-k ranks. We also show that our model is computationally efficient and scalable to very large document collections.
