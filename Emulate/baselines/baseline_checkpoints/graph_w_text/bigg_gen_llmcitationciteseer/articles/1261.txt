Traffic congestion is a pervasive problem in urban areas, and optimizing traffic signal control is crucial for reducing travel times and improving air quality. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for real-time traffic signal control, which adapts to changing traffic patterns and minimizes congestion. Our method leverages a graph neural network to model the traffic network and a deep Q-network to learn optimal signal control policies. We evaluate our approach using real-world traffic data from the city of Pittsburgh, demonstrating significant reductions in travel times and emissions compared to traditional signal control methods.
