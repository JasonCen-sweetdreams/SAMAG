Decentralized task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to adapt to dynamic environments and make decisions without a central controller. This paper proposes a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn decentralized task allocation policies. We introduce a hierarchical GNN architecture that captures agent-agent and agent-task relationships, enabling agents to make informed decisions about task assignment. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized algorithms.
