Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems struggle to accurately retrieve relevant documents due to the complexity of medical terminology and the scarcity of annotated data. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'MedQN', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of medical concepts. MedQN integrates a pre-trained language model with a domain-specific knowledge graph to generate high-quality expansion terms, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-COVID dataset demonstrate that MedQN outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision.
