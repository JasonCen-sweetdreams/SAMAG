Autonomous urban planning involves coordinating multiple agents to achieve complex tasks, such as traffic management and waste collection. This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent coordination using hierarchical task networks (HTNs). Our framework, called 'UrbanPlan', represents tasks as HTNs and leverages planning-based reasoning to generate coordinated plans for agents. We evaluate UrbanPlan in a simulated urban environment and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing circumstances, such as traffic congestion or unexpected events. Results show that UrbanPlan outperforms traditional planning-based approaches in terms of plan quality and execution time.
