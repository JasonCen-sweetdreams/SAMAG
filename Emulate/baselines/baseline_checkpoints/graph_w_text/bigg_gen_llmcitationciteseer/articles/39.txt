Column-oriented database systems have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to efficiently process analytical queries. However, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck in these systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'COLOPT', which leverages statistical models to predict the most efficient query execution plan. Our approach takes into account the columnar storage layout and the underlying hardware architecture to minimize I/O overhead and maximize CPU utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that COLOPT outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 50% in terms of query execution time.
