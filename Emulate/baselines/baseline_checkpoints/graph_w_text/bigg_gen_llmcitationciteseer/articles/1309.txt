This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in dynamic environments. We propose a novel algorithm, 'DAMA', which enables agents to learn from local observations and adapt to changing task requirements. DAMA uses a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture to coordinate agent actions and minimize task allocation conflicts. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that DAMA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and system responsiveness.
