Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing complex relationships between data entities. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the vast search space of possible query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query performance. Our experiments on real-world graph datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
