The proliferation of IoT devices has led to a surge in demand for efficient resource allocation mechanisms. This paper presents a novel agent-based framework, 'ResourceHub', that leverages distributed decision-making to allocate resources in IoT networks. We design a multi-agent system comprising autonomous agents that negotiate and coordinate resource allocation using a decentralized auction-based approach. Our experiments on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that ResourceHub achieves a 30% reduction in resource allocation latency and a 25% increase in overall network utilization compared to traditional centralized approaches.
