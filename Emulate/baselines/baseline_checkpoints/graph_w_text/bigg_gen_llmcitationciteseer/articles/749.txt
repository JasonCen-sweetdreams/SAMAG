This study investigates the design of accessible gestural interfaces for older adults, focusing on gesture recognition and user experience. We developed a novel gesture recognition system that leverages machine learning and computer vision to recognize gestures from older adults. Our user study with 30 participants aged 65-85 reveals that our system achieves an accuracy of 92% and outperforms existing systems. We also identify key design principles for accessible gestural interfaces, including simplicity, consistency, and feedback. Our findings have implications for the design of assistive technologies and gesture-based interfaces for older adults.
