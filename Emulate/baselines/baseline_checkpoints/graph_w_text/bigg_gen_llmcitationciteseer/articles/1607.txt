Query expansion is a crucial component of information retrieval systems, particularly in sparse document collections where relevant terms may be missing. This paper proposes a novel reinforced query expansion approach, 'RQE-RL', which leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select expansion terms based on their potential impact on retrieval performance. We define a reward function that balances precision and recall, and demonstrate the effectiveness of RQE-RL in improving retrieval accuracy on several benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that RQE-RL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, especially in cases where the initial query is ill-defined or incomplete.
