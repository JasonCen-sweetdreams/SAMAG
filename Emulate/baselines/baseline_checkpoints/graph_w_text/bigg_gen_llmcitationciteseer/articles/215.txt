Short-text retrieval is a challenging task in information retrieval, where the brevity of queries hinders the effectiveness of traditional retrieval models. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding approach for query expansion, which leverages the semantic relationships between words in the query and the document collection. Our method, GraphEx, represents queries and documents as dense vectors in a joint graph-structured space, enabling the capture of nuanced contextual dependencies. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
