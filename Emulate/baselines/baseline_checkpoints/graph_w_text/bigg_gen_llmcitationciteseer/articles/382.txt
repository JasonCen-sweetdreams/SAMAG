This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. Our approach, dubbed 'Dec-TARL', enables agents to learn optimal task assignments in a distributed manner, without relying on a centralized controller. We formulate the task allocation problem as a Markov game and employ a decentralized actor-critic algorithm to learn effective policies. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that Dec-TARL outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
