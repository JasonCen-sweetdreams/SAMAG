Coordinating multiple agents in complex systems is a challenging problem, requiring efficient communication, negotiation, and decision-making. This paper presents a novel approach, Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning (DGRL), which leverages graph neural networks to learn effective coordination policies in multi-agent systems. DGRL enables agents to reason about their interactions and adapt to changing environments, outperforming traditional methods in simulated traffic management and resource allocation scenarios. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence and stability of DGRL, facilitating its deployment in real-world applications.
