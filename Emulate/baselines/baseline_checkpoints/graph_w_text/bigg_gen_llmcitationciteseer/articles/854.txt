Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their usability by individuals with dyslexia is often overlooked. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an inclusive voice assistant, 'DysAssist', tailored to the needs of users with dyslexia. We conducted interviews and surveys with dyslexic individuals to identify specific challenges and preferences, and incorporated these insights into the development of DysAssist. Our prototype features adaptive speech recognition, visual prompts, and personalized feedback mechanisms to enhance user experience and accuracy. A user study with 20 participants showed significant improvements in task completion rate and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
