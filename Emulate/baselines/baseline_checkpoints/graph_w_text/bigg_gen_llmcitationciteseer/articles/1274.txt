Autonomous vehicle fleets are becoming increasingly prevalent, but efficient task allocation remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for task allocation in autonomous vehicle fleets. Our approach, 'MAVEN', leverages graph neural networks to model the complex interactions between vehicles and tasks, and employs a decentralized actor-critic algorithm to learn optimal task allocation policies. Experimental results on a real-world transportation dataset demonstrate that MAVEN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, travel time, and overall system efficiency.
