Column-oriented NoSQL databases have become increasingly popular for big data analytics due to their high storage efficiency and fast query performance. However, indexing mechanisms in these systems are often optimized for batch processing, leading to poor performance in real-time analytics. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'ColIndex', which leverages the column-store layout to create a hierarchical, compressed index that supports efficient range queries and aggregations. Our experiments on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that ColIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 5x in query latency and 3x in storage efficiency.
