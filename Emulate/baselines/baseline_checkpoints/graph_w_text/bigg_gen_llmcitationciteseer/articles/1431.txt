Distributed search systems are widely used in modern information retrieval applications, but they often suffer from inefficient query processing due to the complexity of user queries. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQR', for query reformulation in distributed search systems. DeepQR employs a hierarchical neural network to learn a semantic representation of user queries and reformulate them into more efficient and effective search queries. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection show that DeepQR significantly improves the retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional query reformulation methods.
