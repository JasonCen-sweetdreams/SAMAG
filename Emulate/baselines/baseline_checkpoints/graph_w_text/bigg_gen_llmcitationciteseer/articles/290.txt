The proliferation of edge devices has created a growing need for efficient AI models that can operate under resource constraints. This paper presents 'EdgeNAS', a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework tailored for edge devices. EdgeNAS employs a hierarchical search space and a customized reinforcement learning algorithm to discover compact, performant models. Experimental results on several edge computing benchmarks demonstrate that EdgeNAS can identify models with up to 3.5x faster inference times and 2x smaller model sizes compared to state-of-the-art NAS methods, while maintaining competitive accuracy.
