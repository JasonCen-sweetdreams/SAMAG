Optimizing query performance is crucial in distributed database systems. Traditional query optimizers rely on rule-based or cost-based approaches, which can be ineffective in complex distributed settings. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach, 'ML-QO', that leverages query execution time and resource utilization data to predict optimal query plans. We develop a novel graph neural network architecture that captures query structure and database schema information, outperforming state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of execution time and resource efficiency. Experimental evaluations on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate the efficacy of ML-QO in improving query performance.
