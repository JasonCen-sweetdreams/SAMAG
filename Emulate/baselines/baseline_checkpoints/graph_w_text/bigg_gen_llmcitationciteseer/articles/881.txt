This study examines the effects of personalization on user engagement in voice-based interfaces. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a voice assistant that adapted to their preferences, goals, and behavioral patterns. Our results show that personalized voice interactions lead to increased user satisfaction, reduced frustration, and improved task completion rates. We also identify the key factors influencing user engagement, including contextual relevance, tone, and language style. The findings have implications for the design of future voice-based systems that aim to enhance user experience.
