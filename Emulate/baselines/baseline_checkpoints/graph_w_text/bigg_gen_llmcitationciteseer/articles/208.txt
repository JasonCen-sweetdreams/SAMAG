Virtual Reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but effective gesture recognition remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the role of multimodal feedback in enhancing user performance and experience in VR-based gesture recognition systems. We designed an experiment that compared three types of feedback – visual, haptic, and auditory – and examined their impact on gesture recognition accuracy, user satisfaction, and cognitive workload. Our results show that multimodal feedback significantly improves recognition accuracy and user experience, with haptic feedback being the most effective. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR-based gesture recognition systems and highlight avenues for future research.
