Patent retrieval systems face the challenge of anticipating the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'PatentQuest', which leverages both lexical and semantic relationships to enrich user queries. We introduce a two-stage approach, where an initial query expansion phase is followed by a re-ranking phase that incorporates patent-specific features, such as citations and claims. Experimental results on a large patent corpus demonstrate that PatentQuest outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision.
