As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible and inclusive interface designs that cater to older adults with motor impairments. This paper presents a gesture-based interface framework, 'EasyGesture', that leverages machine learning-driven gesture recognition and real-time feedback to facilitate intuitive interaction for individuals with limited dexterity. We conducted a usability study with 20 older adults and found that EasyGesture significantly improved interaction accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional mouse-based interfaces. Our results inform the design of accessible and empowering HCI systems for older adults.
