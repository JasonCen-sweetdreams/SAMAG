Intelligent virtual assistants (IVAs) have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the impact of gamification on user interaction with IVAs. We design and implement a gamified IVA system, incorporating elements such as points, badges, and leaderboards. A user study with 100 participants reveals that gamification significantly increases user engagement, task completion rates, and overall satisfaction. We also identify key design factors influencing user behavior, including personalized feedback and social sharing. Our findings have implications for the development of more engaging and effective IVAs in various domains.
