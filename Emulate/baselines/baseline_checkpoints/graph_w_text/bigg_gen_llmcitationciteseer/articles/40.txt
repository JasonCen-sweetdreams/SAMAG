Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interaction designs often neglect the needs of users with disabilities. This paper investigates the impact of personalized error recovery strategies on the user experience of individuals with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, combining quantitative data from usability testing with qualitative insights from interviews and surveys. Our findings suggest that adaptive error handling can significantly reduce frustration and improve overall satisfaction among users with disabilities. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants and discuss the implications for future research in HCI.
