This paper presents EmoReact, a real-time emotion-aware chatbot designed to provide personalized mental health support. EmoReact leverages multimodal sentiment analysis and emotional intelligence to recognize and respond to users' emotional states. We develop a novel affective computing framework that integrates natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning to detect emotional cues from text, speech, and facial expressions. Our user study with 150 participants shows that EmoReact significantly improves users' self-reported emotional well-being and reduces feelings of loneliness and anxiety.
