In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism for task allocation, where agents bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We introduce a novel bidding strategy that incorporates task dependencies and agent heterogeneity, ensuring efficient allocation while minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced latency compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
