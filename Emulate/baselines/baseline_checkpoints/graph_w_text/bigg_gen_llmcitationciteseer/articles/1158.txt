In multi-agent systems, negotiation is a crucial aspect of cooperation and decision-making. However, incomplete information about other agents' preferences and intentions can lead to suboptimal outcomes. This paper presents a novel autonomous negotiation strategy, ' InfoNegotiator', which utilizes partial observability and probabilistic reasoning to adapt to uncertain environments. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian framework that integrates opponent modeling, preference elicitation, and strategy selection. Experimental results on a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate that InfoNegotiator outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of negotiation efficiency and outcome quality.
