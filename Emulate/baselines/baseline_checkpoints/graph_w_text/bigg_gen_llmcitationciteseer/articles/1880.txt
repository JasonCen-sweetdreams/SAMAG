Join order optimization is a crucial task in relational databases, as it significantly affects query performance. However, existing approaches often fail to consider the unique challenges of distributed databases, leading to suboptimal plans. This paper presents a novel join order optimization algorithm, 'Distributed-JO', which leverages a hybrid of machine learning and dynamic programming to efficiently explore the vast search space of possible join orders. Our approach takes into account data distribution, network latency, and processing power to generate optimal plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate that Distributed-JO outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
