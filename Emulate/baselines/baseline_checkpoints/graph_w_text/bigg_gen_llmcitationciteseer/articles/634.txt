The increasing volume of digital documents necessitates efficient and accurate retrieval techniques. This paper presents a novel neural ranking model, ProxNR, which leverages proximity-aware features to capture complex relationships between query terms and document contents. By incorporating a hierarchical attention mechanism and a novel proximity-based similarity metric, ProxNR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while reducing computational costs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ProxNR in handling long-tail queries and improving overall retrieval efficiency.
