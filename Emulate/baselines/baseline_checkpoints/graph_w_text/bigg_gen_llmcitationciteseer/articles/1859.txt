Domain-specific search engines often struggle to retrieve relevant documents due to the limited query context and vocabulary mismatch. This paper proposes a neural query expansion approach, 'NQE-DSS', which leverages domain knowledge graphs and contextualized language models to generate more informative and diverse query representations. Our experiments on a medical search dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming traditional query expansion methods and state-of-the-art neural ranking models. We also analyze the effectiveness of NQE-DSS in reducing the vocabulary gap between users and domain-specific documents.
