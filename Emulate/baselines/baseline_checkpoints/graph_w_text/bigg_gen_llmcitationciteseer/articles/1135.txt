Real-time information retrieval systems require efficient document filtering to reduce the latency and computational overhead of retrieving relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages sentence embeddings to filter out irrelevant documents. We introduce a hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups sentences based on their semantic meaning and uses a threshold-based filtering mechanism to eliminate non-relevant documents. Experimental results on the TREC dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant reduction in latency while maintaining a high precision of retrieved documents.
