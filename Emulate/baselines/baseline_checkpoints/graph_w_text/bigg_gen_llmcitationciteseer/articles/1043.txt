Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to enhance the daily lives of older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing AR interfaces often overlook the unique needs and challenges of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible AR interfaces that cater to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies to inform the development of an AR prototype that uses simplified visual cues, auditory feedback, and gesture-based interactions to support wayfinding and object recognition tasks. Our evaluation results show significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional screen-based interfaces.
