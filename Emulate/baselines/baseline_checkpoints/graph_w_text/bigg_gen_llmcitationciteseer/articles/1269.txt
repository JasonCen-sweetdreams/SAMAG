The increasing scale and complexity of modern database systems necessitate efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents 'AQOra', a novel adaptive query optimization framework for distributed database systems. AQOra leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and dynamic plan refinement to optimize query execution plans in real-time. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale distributed database cluster demonstrates that AQOra achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional query optimization techniques, while reducing optimization overhead by 40%
