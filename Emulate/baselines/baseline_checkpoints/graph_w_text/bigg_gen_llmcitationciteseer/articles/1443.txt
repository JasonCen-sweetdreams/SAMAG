Mobile text entry remains a significant bottleneck in human-computer interaction. This paper introduces EyeGazeType, a novel system that leverages gaze-based predictive modeling to improve text entry efficiency on mobile devices. By integrating eye-tracking with machine learning, EyeGazeType accurately predicts the user's intended characters and words, reducing the need for manual corrections. Our user study with 30 participants demonstrated a significant increase in text entry speed and accuracy, with an average reduction of 23.5% in keystrokes and 17.2% in error rate compared to traditional touch-based input methods.
