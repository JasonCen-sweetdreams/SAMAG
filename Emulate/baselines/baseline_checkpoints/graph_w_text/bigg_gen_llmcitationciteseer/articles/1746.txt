Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle with the vocabulary mismatch problem, where the query terms fail to match the relevant documents. Query expansion (QE) techniques can alleviate this issue, but most existing methods rely on heuristics or manual tuning. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for QE, where an agent learns to select relevant expansion terms based on the retrieval feedback. We introduce a novel reward function that balances the trade-off between precision and recall, and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art QE methods on the TREC-COVID dataset.
