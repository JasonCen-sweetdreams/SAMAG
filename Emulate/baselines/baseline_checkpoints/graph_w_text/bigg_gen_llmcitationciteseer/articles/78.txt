In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel, decentralized auction-based approach for task allocation, dubbed 'DARTA'. By leveraging a combination of combinatorial auctions and distributed constraint optimization, DARTA enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences, while ensuring that the overall system objective is optimized. We evaluate DARTA through extensive simulations, demonstrating its scalability, flexibility, and robustness in various application domains, including disaster response and autonomous robotics.
