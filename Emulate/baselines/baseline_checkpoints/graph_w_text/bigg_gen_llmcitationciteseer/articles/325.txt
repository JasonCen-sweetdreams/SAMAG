Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their personalized responses often raise concerns about user experience and autonomy. This study explores the effects of personalization on user satisfaction, trust, and decision-making in voice assistants. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants, who interacted with either a personalized or non-personalized voice assistant. Our results show that personalization can lead to increased satisfaction and trust, but also decreases users' perceived control and autonomy. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of voice assistants and propose a framework for balancing personalization with user agency.
