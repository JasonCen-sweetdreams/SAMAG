Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in information retrieval, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in unstructured text. Existing approaches often rely on hand-crafted features or traditional machine learning methods, which can be computationally expensive and lack flexibility. This paper proposes a novel real-time entity disambiguation framework that leverages knowledge graph embeddings and hierarchical attention mechanisms. Our approach learns to represent entities as dense vectors, enabling efficient similarity calculations, and incorporates hierarchical attention to model complex relationships between entities and context. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and inference time, making it suitable for real-time applications.
