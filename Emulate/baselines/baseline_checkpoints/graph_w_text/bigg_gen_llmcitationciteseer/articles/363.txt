Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their scalability and fault-tolerance. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and develop a deep Q-network-based algorithm to learn the optimal query plan. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
