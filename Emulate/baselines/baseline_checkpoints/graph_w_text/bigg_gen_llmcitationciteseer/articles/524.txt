Multi-tenancy in Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms has led to increased resource contention and degraded query performance. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to minimize query latency and resource utilization. Our approach, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan selection policy based on workload characteristics and resource availability. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform show that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
