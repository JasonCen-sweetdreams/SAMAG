Cloud-native applications require efficient resource allocation to ensure scalability and performance. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to optimize resource allocation in cloud environments. We propose a novel DRL framework, 'CloudOpt', which leverages a combination of actor-critic methods and graph neural networks to learn resource allocation policies. Our experiments on a cloud-based simulation platform demonstrate that CloudOpt achieves significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and cost reduction compared to traditional rule-based allocation methods.
