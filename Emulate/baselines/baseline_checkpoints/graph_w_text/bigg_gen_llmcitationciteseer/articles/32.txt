Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely on effective query representations to retrieve relevant documents. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, Neural Query Graph Expansion (NQGE), which leverages neural query graph embeddings to capture complex query-document relationships. NQGE uses a graph attention mechanism to learn weighted representations of query terms and their contextual relationships, enabling more accurate expansion of query concepts. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQGE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
