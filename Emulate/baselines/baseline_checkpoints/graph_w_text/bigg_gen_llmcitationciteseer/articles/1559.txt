This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent planning approach for autonomous vehicles operating in urban environments. Our framework, called 'MAP-Urban', enables vehicles to coordinate and make decisions in real-time, taking into account dynamic traffic patterns, pedestrian behavior, and infrastructure constraints. We propose a novel distributed constraint optimization algorithm that leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and optimize global objectives. Experimental results in a simulated urban scenario demonstrate that MAP-Urban improves navigation efficiency, reduces congestion, and enhances safety compared to traditional centralized planning methods.
