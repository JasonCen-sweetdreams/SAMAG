This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, which leverages auction-based mechanisms to efficiently assign tasks to agents. We introduce a novel auction protocol, called 'ATAM', that takes into account agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. ATAM is shown to outperform traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of completion time and resource utilization. We evaluate our approach through extensive simulations on a variety of scenarios, demonstrating its scalability and adaptability in dynamic environments.
