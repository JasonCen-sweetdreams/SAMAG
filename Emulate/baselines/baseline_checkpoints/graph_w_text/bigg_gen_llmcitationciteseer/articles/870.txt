Distributed relational databases (DRDBs) have become a cornerstone of modern data management. However, optimizing query performance in DRDBs remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically adjust query execution plans based on real-time system and workload conditions. Our RL agent learns to optimize query execution through trial and error, resulting in significant performance gains. Experimental results on a real-world DRDB setup demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 35% in terms of query response time.
