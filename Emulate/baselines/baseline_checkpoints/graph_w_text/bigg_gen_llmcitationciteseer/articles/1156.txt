Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when queries are short or ambiguous. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, dubbed 'QDE', which selectively incorporates relevant contextual information into the document representation. QDE leverages a graph-based neural network to model the semantic relationships between query terms and document entities, thereby enriching the document's semantic space. Experimental results on the TREC-8 Ad-hoc dataset demonstrate that QDE significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, especially for difficult queries, achieving a 15% relative increase in mean average precision over state-of-the-art baselines.
