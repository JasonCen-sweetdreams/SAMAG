This paper proposes a novel framework for coordinating multi-agent systems in urban traffic management using hierarchical reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'Traffic Hierarchies' (TH), leverages a hierarchical architecture to decompose the complex traffic management problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems. We introduce a novel reward function that incorporates both local and global traffic metrics, enabling agents to learn effective coordination strategies. Experimental results on a simulated urban traffic network demonstrate that TH outperforms traditional decentralized approaches, achieving significant reductions in travel time and congestion.
