Distributed database systems often struggle with efficient data retrieval due to the complexity of querying and indexing large datasets. This paper proposes a novel approach using hierarchical Bloom filters to accelerate data retrieval in distributed database systems. Our method exploits the hierarchical structure of Bloom filters to reduce the number of false positives and minimize the communication overhead between nodes. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing indexing techniques in terms of query latency and throughput.
