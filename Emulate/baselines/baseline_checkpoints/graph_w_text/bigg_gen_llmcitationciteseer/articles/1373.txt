Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to retrieve relevant documents when users pose ambiguous or incomplete queries. We propose a novel approach that leverages query reformulation to improve document retrieval. Our method, 'QR-DR', uses a neural query rewriting model to generate a set of paraphrased queries from the original user query. We then combine the results from each paraphrased query using a novel ranking fusion technique. Experiments on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate that QR-DR outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, particularly for queries with low lexical overlap with relevant documents.
