Multi-attribute queries (MAQs) are a crucial component of modern information retrieval systems. However, their performance is often hindered by the complexity of query rewriting. This paper proposes a novel neural rewriting approach, 'NeuroRewrite', which leverages deep learning to generate optimized query plans for MAQs. Our approach learns to identify keyword patterns, attribute relationships, and query intent to produce rewritten queries that reduce computational overhead and improve result relevance. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that NeuroRewrite outperforms state-of-the-art query rewriting techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
