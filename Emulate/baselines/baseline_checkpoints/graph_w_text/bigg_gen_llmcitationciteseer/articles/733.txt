This paper presents a novel multi-agent system for real-time traffic optimization, designed to tackle the scalability challenges of large-scale traffic networks. Our approach leverages a hierarchical architecture, where agents are organized into clusters and communicate with each other through a distributed blackboard. We propose a probabilistic decision-making framework that enables agents to adapt to changing traffic conditions and optimize traffic flow in real-time. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate a significant reduction in travel time and congestion compared to existing approaches.
