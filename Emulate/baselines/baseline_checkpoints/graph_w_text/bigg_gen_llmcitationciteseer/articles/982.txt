Multi-label classification is a fundamental problem in many applications, where each instance is associated with multiple labels. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in this task, but they often neglect the hierarchical structure of the label space. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that incorporates label relationships into the graph attention mechanism. HGAT uses a hierarchical graph to model the label space, where each node represents a label and edges capture their semantic relationships. We demonstrate the efficacy of HGAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multi-label classification tasks.
