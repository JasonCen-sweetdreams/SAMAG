Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed databases. We design a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that models the query optimization problem and uses Q-learning to learn an optimal policy. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
