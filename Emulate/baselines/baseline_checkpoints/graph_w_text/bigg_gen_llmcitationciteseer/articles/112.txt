Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant texts for answer extraction. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'SparseGNN', which leverages sparse graph neural networks to model the semantic relationships between passages and questions. By exploiting the sparsity patterns in the graph, SparseGNN reduces the computational complexity of passage retrieval, achieving a 3x speedup over state-of-the-art dense graph models. Experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that SparseGNN maintains comparable answer accuracy to dense models while significantly reducing the retrieval time.
