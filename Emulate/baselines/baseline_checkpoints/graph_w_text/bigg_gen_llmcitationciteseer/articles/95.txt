Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches struggle with scalability as datasets grow in size. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing technique, 'GraphED', which leverages the structural properties of knowledge graphs to efficiently disambiguate entities. By constructing a hierarchical graph index, GraphED reduces the search space for candidate entities, resulting in significant speedups and improved accuracy. Experimental results on large-scale knowledge graphs demonstrate that GraphED outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average precision of 95.2% while reducing query times by up to 75%.
