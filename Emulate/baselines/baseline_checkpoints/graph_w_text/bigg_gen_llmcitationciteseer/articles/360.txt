Human activity recognition (HAR) is a fundamental task in various applications, including healthcare, surveillance, and robotics. This paper presents a novel graph-based neural network (GNN) framework for real-time HAR, leveraging the structural relationships between body joints. Our model, GraphHAR, incorporates a spatio-temporal graph attention mechanism to capture complex motion patterns and contextual dependencies. Experimental results on public HAR datasets demonstrate that GraphHAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and inference speed, making it suitable for real-world applications.
