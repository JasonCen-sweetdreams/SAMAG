In multi-agent systems, agents often hold incomplete or uncertain information about their environment. This paper presents a novel distributed belief revision framework that enables agents to update their beliefs in response to new information, while respecting the constraints imposed by incomplete knowledge. Our approach leverages a probabilistic ontology to represent agent beliefs and a distributed consensus protocol to ensure consistency across the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations on a smart traffic management scenario, where agents must adapt to changing traffic patterns and uncertain sensor readings.
