Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for business intelligence and analytics. However, join optimization remains a major bottleneck in achieving low-latency query performance. This paper presents a novel join optimization technique, 'JoinFlex', which leverages a combination of machine learning-based cost estimation and dynamic reordering of join operations. We demonstrate that JoinFlex can reduce query response times by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods, while maintaining high accuracy and robustness. Experimental evaluation is performed on a large-scale dataset from a real-world e-commerce platform.
