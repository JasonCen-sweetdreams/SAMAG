This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in heterogeneous agent teams, where agents have diverse capabilities and tasks have varying requirements. We propose a decentralized approach based on distributed constraint optimization (DCOP), which enables agents to autonomously allocate tasks while respecting constraints and optimizing a global objective. Our DCOP-based framework, called HATOA, exploits the notion of 'virtual agents' to facilitate knowledge sharing and coordination among agents. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that HATOA outperforms traditional centralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
