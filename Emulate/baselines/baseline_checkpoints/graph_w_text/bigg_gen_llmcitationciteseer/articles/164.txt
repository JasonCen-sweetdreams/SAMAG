Real-time analytics on distributed column-stores is crucial for various applications, including IoT and financial trading. However, optimizing queries for such systems is a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel cost-based optimization framework, 'RTOpt', which leverages machine learning models to predict query execution times and adapts to changing workloads. RTOpt incorporates a novel column-store-aware indexing strategy and a distributed query rewriting mechanism to minimize data transfer and reduce latency. Experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that RTOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 3x in query response times.
