This study investigates the design of gestural interfaces that cater to older adults with motor impairments. We developed a novel gesture recognition system that incorporates machine learning-based gesture filtering and adaptive gesture segmentation. Our user study with 20 older adults with Parkinson's disease shows that our system reduces gesture recognition errors by 35% compared to a baseline system. We also present a set of design guidelines for accessible gestural interfaces, emphasizing the importance of flexibility, adaptability, and feedback. Our work contributes to the development of more inclusive and supportive interaction technologies for older adults with motor impairments.
