Cloud computing resources are often underutilized, leading to inefficiencies and increased costs. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARLA', which enables autonomic resource allocation in cloud data centers. MARLA employs a decentralized, cooperative approach, where agents learn to optimize resource allocation based on local observations and reward signals. We evaluate MARLA on a real-world cloud workload dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and energy efficiency compared to traditional, rule-based allocation strategies.
