Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly prevalent in various domains, but the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience remains understudied. This paper investigates the effects of haptic feedback on user performance, satisfaction, and presence in VR interfaces. We conducted a user study with 40 participants, comparing three conditions: no haptic feedback, vibrotactile feedback, and electroencephalography (EEG)-based feedback. Results show that haptic feedback significantly improves task completion time and user satisfaction, while EEG-based feedback enhances sense of presence. Our findings provide insights for the design of effective haptic feedback mechanisms in VR interfaces.
