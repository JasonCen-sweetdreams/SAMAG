Neural search engines have shown promising results in various information retrieval tasks, but often suffer from limited query representation capacity. This paper proposes an adaptive query expansion framework, 'AQE-CL', that leverages contrastive learning to learn informative query augmentation strategies. AQE-CL generates synthetic queries by perturbing the original query using a learned noise distribution, and then fine-tunes the neural search model using a contrastive objective. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AQE-CL significantly improves the retrieval performance of neural search engines, particularly for rare and long-tail queries.
