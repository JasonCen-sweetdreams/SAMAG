Handling continuous data streams in real-time is a significant challenge in many applications, including IoT and financial analytics. This paper presents a novel online hierarchical clustering algorithm, 'StreamHClust', that adapts to evolving data distributions and concept drifts. By leveraging incremental learning and a probabilistic data structure, StreamHClust achieves efficient clustering updates and accurate results even in the presence of noisy data. Our experiments demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of StreamHClust on various synthetic and real-world datasets.
