Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive conversational interfaces for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults with cognitive impairments and their caregivers, identifying key design principles and heuristics. We developed a prototype conversational system, 'CareChat', which incorporates these principles, including simplified language, visual cues, and error tolerance. Our usability study shows that CareChat significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
