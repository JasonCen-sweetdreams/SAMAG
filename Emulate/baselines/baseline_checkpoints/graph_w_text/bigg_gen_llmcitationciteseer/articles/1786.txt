Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in knowledge graph construction, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in a text. Existing approaches suffer from scalability issues or rely on manual feature engineering. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding method, 'GraphED', which learns to represent entities and mentions in a shared vector space. By incorporating graph attention mechanisms and a novel graph-based objective function, GraphED achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while scaling to large knowledge graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphED on a real-world knowledge graph with millions of entities.
