The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential growth in time-series data, straining the capabilities of traditional database systems. This paper presents a novel indexing scheme, 'ChronoHash', designed for real-time time-series data in distributed database systems. ChronoHash leverages a combination of hash-based and tree-based indexing to achieve efficient query processing and data ingestion rates. Our experiments on a 100-node cluster demonstrate that ChronoHash outperforms existing indexing schemes by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of data ingestion throughput.
