Traditional sentence embeddings often rely on static representations, which may not effectively capture the nuances of ad-hoc queries. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'QDSE', which generates query-dependent sentence embeddings by incorporating query-aware attention mechanisms. Our method leverages a neural ranking model to learn a joint representation space for queries and sentences, enabling more accurate retrieval results. Experimental evaluations on the TREC-8 and Robust-04 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries with ambiguous or nuanced semantics.
