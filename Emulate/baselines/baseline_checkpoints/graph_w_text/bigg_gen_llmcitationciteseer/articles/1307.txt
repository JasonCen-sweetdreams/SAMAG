Query optimization is a crucial component of database systems, but it becomes increasingly complex in distributed settings. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design an RL agent that learns to select efficient query plans based on runtime statistics and feedback. Our experiments on a distributed database system show that the RL-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
