This paper presents a novel approach to cooperative task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities and the system's global objective. Our approach uses a multi-agent deep Q-network to learn the optimal task allocation policy, taking into account the agents' dynamics and the environment's uncertainty. Experimental results on a simulated robotic system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and system efficiency.
