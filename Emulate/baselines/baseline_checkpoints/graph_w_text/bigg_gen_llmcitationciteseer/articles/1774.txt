Sparse term frequency vectors are widely used in information retrieval (IR) systems for efficient document representation. However, computing exact sparse representations can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a neural approximation framework, 'NeuSparse', which learns to approximate sparse term frequency vectors using a deep neural network. We demonstrate that NeuSparse achieves comparable retrieval performance to exact sparse representations while reducing computational costs by up to 70%. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that NeuSparse outperforms state-of-the-art approximate methods, enabling faster and more efficient document retrieval systems.
