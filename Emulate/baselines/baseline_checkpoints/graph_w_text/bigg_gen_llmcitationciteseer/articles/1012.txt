Domain-specific search engines cater to users seeking information within a specific domain, requiring efficient and accurate retrieval. This paper proposes a hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages domain knowledge to generate context-dependent query terms. HQE integrates a probabilistic topic model with a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify relevant sub-domains and expand the query accordingly. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency, achieving a 25% increase in precision and a 30% reduction in query latency compared to traditional query expansion methods.
