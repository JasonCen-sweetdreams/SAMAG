The rise of social media has made it challenging to combat fake news propagation. Existing detection methods often rely on handcrafted features or focus solely on textual information, neglecting the rich structural patterns present in news dissemination networks. We propose HAGCN, a novel hierarchical attention graph convolutional network that integrates node-level, community-level, and graph-level features to detect fake news. Our model leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant neighborhoods, enabling interpretable explanations for its predictions. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HAGCN over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an F1-score improvement of 8.5% and 11.2%, respectively.
