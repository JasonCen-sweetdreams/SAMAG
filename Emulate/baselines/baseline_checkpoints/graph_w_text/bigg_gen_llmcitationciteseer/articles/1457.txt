Temporal graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex, time-evolving relationships. However, optimizing queries for real-time analytics on these databases remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'Tempo', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and graph summarization techniques. Tempo outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of resource utilization, as demonstrated on a real-world social media graph dataset.
