Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a widely used technique to improve retrieval performance, but it often relies on simplistic term weighting schemes. This paper proposes a deep neural ranking model, dubbed 'NERD', which learns to predict the relevance of expansion terms based on their semantic relationships with the query. We incorporate NERD into a state-of-the-art retrieval pipeline and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness on several benchmark datasets. Our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
