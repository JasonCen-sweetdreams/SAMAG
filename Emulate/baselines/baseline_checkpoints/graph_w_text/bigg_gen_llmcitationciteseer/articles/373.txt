Multi-tenant database systems pose significant query optimization challenges due to varying workload patterns and resource constraints. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans in such systems. We propose a novel RL framework, 'QTune', which learns to adapt to changing workloads and resource availability through trial and error. QTune utilizes a combination of exploration-exploitation strategies and a custom-designed reward function to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database benchmark demonstrate that QTune outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 35% in terms of query latency reduction.
