The proliferation of IoT devices and real-time analytics has led to an explosion in data volume and velocity, necessitating efficient query optimization techniques for NoSQL databases. This paper presents AQO, a novel adaptive query optimization framework for column-oriented NoSQL databases. AQO leverages machine learning-based workload forecasting and cost-based optimization to dynamically adjust query plans in response to changing workload patterns. Our experiments on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that AQO achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance and 2x reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
