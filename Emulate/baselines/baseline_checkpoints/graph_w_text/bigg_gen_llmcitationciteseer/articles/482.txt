This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent pathfinding, a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence and robotics. Our method, called HGD-MAPF, leverages hierarchical graph decomposition to reduce the computational complexity of finding collision-free paths for multiple agents in large, dynamic environments. We propose a two-level hierarchy, where agents are first clustered into groups and then solved independently using a decentralized planning framework. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that HGD-MAPF outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of scalability, solution quality, and computational efficiency.
