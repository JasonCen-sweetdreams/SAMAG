Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their effectiveness can be hindered by age-related differences in spoken language understanding. This study investigates how older adults' speech patterns, cognitive abilities, and technology experience influence their interactions with voice assistants. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65-85, using a custom-built voice assistant and a standardized cognitive assessment battery. Our results show that older adults face significant challenges in using voice assistants, particularly due to cognitive decline and technology anxiety. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants, emphasizing the need for adaptive language processing, clear feedback, and user-centered training protocols.
