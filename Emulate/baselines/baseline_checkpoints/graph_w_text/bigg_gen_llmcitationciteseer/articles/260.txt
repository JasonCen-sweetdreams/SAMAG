The proliferation of IoT devices and sensor networks has led to an explosion in time-series data, posing significant challenges for scalable and efficient data indexing. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, AdaptiveBloomTS, which leverages Bloom filters to accelerate range queries in distributed time-series databases. Our approach dynamically adjusts the filter size and hash functions based on the underlying data distribution, ensuring optimal performance and storage efficiency. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that AdaptiveBloomTS outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage savings.
