This paper presents a novel approach to designing adaptive menus for elderly users with cognitive impairments. Our system, called 'EasyMenu', uses machine learning algorithms to adapt menu layouts and item arrangements based on user behavior, cognitive abilities, and task complexity. We conducted a user study with 30 participants and found that EasyMenu reduced menu navigation time by 35% and error rates by 50% compared to traditional menu designs. Our results demonstrate the potential of adaptive menus to improve the accessibility and usability of digital interfaces for elderly users with cognitive impairments.
