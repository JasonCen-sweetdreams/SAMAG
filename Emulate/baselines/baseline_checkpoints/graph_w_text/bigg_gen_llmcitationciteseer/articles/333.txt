In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective objectives. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to coordinate task allocation among agents. Our method, called MARL-TA, uses a decentralized actor-critic framework to learn policies for each agent that maximize system-level rewards. We introduce a new attention-based mechanism that enables agents to selectively communicate and adapt to changing task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that MARL-TA outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to dynamic environments.
