Virtual reality (VR) technology has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but its adoption is often hindered by motion sickness and user discomfort. This paper explores the role of haptic feedback in enhancing VR user experience. We design and evaluate a novel haptic feedback system that provides synchronized tactile and kinesthetic cues to users. Our user study involving 30 participants shows that haptic feedback significantly reduces motion sickness, improves user satisfaction, and increases task performance. We also identify key design factors influencing the effectiveness of haptic feedback in VR.
