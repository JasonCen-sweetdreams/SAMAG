As human-computer collaboration becomes increasingly prevalent, detecting user intentions accurately and efficiently is crucial. This paper presents a novel gaze-based intention detection system, leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze eye movements and infer user goals. Our system, 'GazeIntent', uses a convolutional neural network to classify gaze patterns and identify intention cues, achieving an accuracy of 92.1% on a dataset of 50 participants. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GazeIntent in a collaborative virtual reality environment, where it enables more efficient and natural human-computer interaction.
