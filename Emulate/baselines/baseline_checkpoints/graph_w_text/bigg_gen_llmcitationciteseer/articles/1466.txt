This paper introduces a novel framework for heterogeneous agent collaboration in dynamic environments, where agents with diverse capabilities and expertise need to adaptively allocate tasks to achieve common goals. We propose a multi-layered architecture that integrates machine learning-based task prediction, real-time agent profiling, and distributed decision-making. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
