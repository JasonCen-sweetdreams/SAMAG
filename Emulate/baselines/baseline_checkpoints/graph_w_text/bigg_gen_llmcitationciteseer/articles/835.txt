This paper addresses the problem of allocating resources among multiple autonomous agents in dynamic environments, where agents' preferences and availability of resources change over time. We propose a decentralized negotiation framework that enables agents to negotiate and reach mutually beneficial agreements. Our approach combines concepts from auction theory and machine learning to develop a novel negotiation mechanism that adapts to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient and fair resource allocations in various scenarios, including those with incomplete information and heterogeneous agents.
