As data volumes continue to grow, efficient join processing is crucial for real-time data analytics. This paper proposes 'QuickJoin', an in-memory join processing framework that leverages novel indexing and caching techniques to accelerate join operations. QuickJoin utilizes a hybrid indexing approach that combines bitmap indexing with learned indexes, reducing memory footprint while maintaining high query performance. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that QuickJoin outperforms state-of-the-art in-memory join algorithms by up to 3x, making it an attractive solution for real-time data analytics workloads.
