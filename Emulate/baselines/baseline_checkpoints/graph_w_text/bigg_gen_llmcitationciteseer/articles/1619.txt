In multi-agent systems, autonomous decision-making is crucial for efficient and effective interactions. This paper proposes a novel approach to autonomous decision-making using deep Q-networks (DQN) in multi-agent systems. We introduce a hierarchical DQN framework that enables agents to learn complex decision-making policies in a distributed manner. Our approach is evaluated in a simulated environment, demonstrating improved decision-making performance and adaptability compared to traditional Q-learning methods. We also analyze the scalability of our approach in large-scale multi-agent systems.
