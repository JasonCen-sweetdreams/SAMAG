Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can have devastating consequences in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. This paper presents a novel adversarial training framework, 'RobustDet', designed for real-time object detection in autonomous systems. RobustDet leverages a combination of input preprocessing, loss function regularization, and a custom-designed adversarial attack algorithm to improve the robustness of object detectors against a wide range of attacks. Our experiments demonstrate that RobustDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark while reducing the computational overhead by 30% compared to existing approaches.
