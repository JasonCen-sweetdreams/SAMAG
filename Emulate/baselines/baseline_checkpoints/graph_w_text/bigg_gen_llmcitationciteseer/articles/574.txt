Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 60 participants, using a novel avatar creation system that incorporates facial recognition and machine learning-based character generation. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, improved sense of presence, and enhanced overall VR experience. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR-based applications in fields such as education, healthcare, and entertainment.
