Ad-hoc retrieval often relies on query expansion techniques to improve retrieval performance. However, existing methods either rely on manually crafted rules or expensive neural models. This paper proposes a novel neural query graph (NQG) approach that learns to expand queries in a data-driven manner. Our NQG model incorporates both semantic and syntactic features of queries and documents, enabling more effective query expansion. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG).
