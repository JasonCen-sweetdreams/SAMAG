Traditional document retrieval methods rely on hand-crafted features and suffer from semantic gap issues. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Neural Network-based Language Model (HNN-LM) for efficient document retrieval. Our approach leverages pre-trained language models to learn hierarchical document representations, capturing both local and global contextual information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HNN-LM on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our model also enables interpretable query-document matching, facilitating explainable IR.
