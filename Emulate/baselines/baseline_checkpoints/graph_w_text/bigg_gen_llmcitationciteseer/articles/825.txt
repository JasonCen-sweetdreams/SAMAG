Traditional query expansion techniques rely on manual rules or shallow linguistic features, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a neural query expansion framework, 'NQE', which leverages deep contextualized embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our experiments on the TREC-8 Ad-Hoc dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and recall over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that NQE is robust to query drift and outperforms traditional methods in cold-start scenarios.
