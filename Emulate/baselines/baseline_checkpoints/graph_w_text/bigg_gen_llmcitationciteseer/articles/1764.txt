Real-time data warehousing imposes stringent performance requirements on query processing. This paper introduces a novel approach to accelerate join operations, a critical component of query processing, using GPU-based parallel processing. We propose a hybrid join algorithm, 'GPU-Join', that leverages the massive parallelism of modern GPUs to accelerate join operations while minimizing memory transfer overhead. Experimental results on a large-scale TPC-H dataset demonstrate that GPU-Join achieves up to 5x speedup over traditional CPU-based join algorithms, making it suitable for real-time data warehousing applications.
