Ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to retrieve relevant documents for complex queries due to the term mismatch problem. This paper proposes a novel dynamic query expansion (DQE) approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively select expansion terms. Our method, RL-DQE, uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that balances the trade-off between query representation and document relevance. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc benchmark show that RL-DQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DQE methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
