Explainability is crucial in real-world autonomous systems, where decision-making processes must be transparent and trustworthy. This paper presents 'XRL', a scalable framework for explainable reinforcement learning that combines model-agnostic explanations with attention-based feature importance. We demonstrate XRL on a challenging autonomous driving scenario, showing that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing real-time explanations for critical decisions. Our framework is highly modular, enabling seamless integration with various reinforcement learning algorithms and autonomous system architectures.
