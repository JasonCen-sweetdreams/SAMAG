In multi-agent systems, trust management is crucial for ensuring cooperation and preventing malicious behavior. This paper proposes a decentralized trust management framework, 'Blockchain for Agents' (BFA), which leverages blockchain technology to establish a transparent and tamper-proof reputation system. BFA enables agents to rate each other's behavior and store these ratings on a blockchain, allowing for the calculation of reputation scores that reflect an agent's trustworthiness. We evaluate BFA through simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness in promoting trust and cooperation in a variety of scenarios.
