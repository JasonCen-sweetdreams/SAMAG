Information retrieval (IR) systems often struggle to efficiently retrieve relevant documents from large collections. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document filtering approach, QADF, which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize the filtering process. QADF learns to dynamically adjust the filtering threshold based on the query complexity and document features, resulting in significant reductions in retrieval time and improved precision. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of QADF in improving the efficiency and accuracy of IR systems.
