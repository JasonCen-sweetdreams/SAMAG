In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper introduces a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reward-shaping functions to guide agent decision-making. We propose a novel reward function that incorporates both local and global task priorities, enabling agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
