Real-time object detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicle systems. This paper presents a novel attention mechanism, 'FastFocus', which significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining detection accuracy. FastFocus adaptively adjusts attention weights based on object saliency and spatial relationships, allowing for efficient processing of high-resolution video feeds. We evaluate FastFocus on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets, demonstrating a 30% reduction in inference time compared to state-of-the-art methods while achieving comparable mAP scores.
