This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in large-scale multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities must be assigned to tasks with varying requirements. We propose a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) architecture that learns to represent agents and tasks as graph-structured data. The HGNN efficiently captures complex relationships between agents and tasks, enabling scalable and effective task allocation. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of assignment quality and computational efficiency, even with thousands of agents and tasks.
