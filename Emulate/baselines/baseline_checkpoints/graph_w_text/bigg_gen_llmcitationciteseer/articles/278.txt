This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the effects of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load and user experience. We designed a VR-based experiment where participants performed tasks using either gesture-based or controller-based interfaces. Our results show that gesture-based interaction reduces cognitive load and improves user engagement, particularly for tasks requiring spatial reasoning. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of intuitive and effective VR interfaces, highlighting the potential of embodied cognition principles to inform HCI research.
