Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a key task in natural language processing, requiring accurate document representation to identify sentiment-bearing aspects. This paper proposes a novel document representation learning framework, 'AspectRep', which leverages a multi-task learning strategy to jointly optimize aspect extraction and sentiment classification. We introduce a hierarchical graph attention mechanism that captures complex document structures and aspect relationships. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AspectRep outperforms state-of-the-art ABSA models, achieving significant improvements in aspect extraction and sentiment accuracy.
