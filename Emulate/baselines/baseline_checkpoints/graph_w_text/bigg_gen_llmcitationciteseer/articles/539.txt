This paper presents a novel multi-agent pathfinding approach for real-time urban traffic management. We propose a hierarchical task allocation framework that decomposes complex traffic management tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks, which are then assigned to individual agents. Each agent employs a probabilistic roadmap method to compute optimal routes, while a central coordinator ensures global optimality and resolves conflicts between agents. Experiments on a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate significant reductions in congestion and travel times compared to traditional centralized approaches.
