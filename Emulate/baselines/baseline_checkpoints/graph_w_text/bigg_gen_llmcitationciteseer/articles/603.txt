The rise of virtual reality (VR) has sparked interest in exploring novel interaction modalities. This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in gesture-based interaction in VR, focusing on the relationship between motor experiences and cognitive processing. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR environment and gesture recognition system. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly influences users' ability to learn and recall gestures, with implications for the design of more intuitive and effective VR interfaces. We also discuss the potential applications of these findings in fields such as education, healthcare, and gaming.
