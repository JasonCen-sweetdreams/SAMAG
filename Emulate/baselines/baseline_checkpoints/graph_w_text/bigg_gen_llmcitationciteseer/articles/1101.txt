The proliferation of heterogeneous document collections has led to a pressing need for efficient and effective query expansion techniques. This paper presents a novel faceted query expansion approach, which leverages semantic role labeling and entity disambiguation to selectively expand query terms. Our method, termed 'FacetQE', is designed to adapt to the specific characteristics of each document collection, thereby improving retrieval performance and reducing computational overhead. Experimental results on a diverse set of benchmark collections demonstrate the superiority of FacetQE over state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and query processing time.
