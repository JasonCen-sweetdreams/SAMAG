In dynamic environments, multi-agent systems require efficient pathfinding algorithms that account for real-time traffic conditions. This paper presents a novel, decentralized approach, 'TrafficAware', which integrates graph-based pathfinding with real-time traffic data from IoT sensors. Our algorithm leverages a hierarchical clustering method to group agents with similar goals, reducing inter-agent collisions and enhancing overall system throughput. Extensive simulations demonstrate that TrafficAware outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of efficiency, safety, and adaptability to changing traffic conditions.
