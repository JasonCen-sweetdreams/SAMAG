This paper presents a novel auction-based mechanism for task allocation in multi-agent systems. Our approach, called CATAMA, leverages a combinatorial auction framework to efficiently allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, preferences, and resource constraints. We prove that CATAMA achieves optimal task allocation under certain conditions and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulations involving heterogeneous agents and tasks. Experimental results show that CATAMA outperforms existing algorithms in terms of task completion rate, agent utility, and system throughput.
