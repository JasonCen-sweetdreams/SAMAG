Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their usability and accessibility for older adults remain a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an accessible voice assistant tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify the key challenges and preferences of older adults when interacting with voice assistants. Our design incorporates a simplified dialogue flow, enhanced error handling, and personalized feedback mechanisms. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing commercial voice assistants.
