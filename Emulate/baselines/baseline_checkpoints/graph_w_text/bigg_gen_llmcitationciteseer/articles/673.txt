The proliferation of cloud-based services has led to a surge in multi-tenant database systems, where numerous tenants share a common infrastructure. Query optimization in such systems is challenging due to the diverse workload characteristics of individual tenants. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MT-QOpt', which leverages machine learning to predict tenant-specific query patterns and adaptively adjusts optimization strategies. Our approach integrates a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group tenants with similar query behavior, enabling more effective resource allocation and improved overall system performance. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database demonstrate that MT-QOpt reduces average query latency by up to 35% compared to existing optimization techniques.
