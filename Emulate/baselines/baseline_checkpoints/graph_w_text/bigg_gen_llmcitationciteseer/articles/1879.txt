In multi-agent systems, negotiation is a crucial mechanism for agents to reach mutually beneficial agreements. However, existing negotiation strategies are often limited to static environments and assume complete information about other agents' preferences. This paper proposes a decentralized negotiation framework, 'DynaNego', which enables agents to adapt to dynamic environments and incomplete information. DynaNego incorporates a novel uncertainty-aware utility function and a probabilistic opponent modeling technique, allowing agents to make informed decisions and improve negotiation outcomes. We evaluate DynaNego in a simulated smart grid scenario, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving efficient and fair resource allocation.
