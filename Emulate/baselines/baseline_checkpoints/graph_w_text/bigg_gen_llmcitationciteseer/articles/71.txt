Multi-agent task allocation is a fundamental problem in distributed artificial intelligence, where agents must efficiently allocate tasks to achieve a common goal. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network (GNN) framework, 'GATA', which learns to represent agent-task relationships as a graph and outputs an optimal allocation. We introduce a novel attention mechanism that captures both local and global dependencies between agents and tasks, leading to improved allocation efficiency and Adaptability. Experimental results on two real-world domains demonstrate that GATA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of allocation quality and computational efficiency.
