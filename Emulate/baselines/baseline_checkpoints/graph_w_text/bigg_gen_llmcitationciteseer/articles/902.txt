In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and fair distribution of tasks among agents. This paper proposes a novel cooperative task allocation framework that incorporates incentive mechanisms to motivate agents to participate and contribute to the system. We design a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) based mechanism that ensures truthfulness and allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities and preferences. Our approach is evaluated through simulations, demonstrating improved system efficiency and fairness compared to existing methods. The proposed framework has applications in various domains, including robotics, smart grids, and supply chain management.
