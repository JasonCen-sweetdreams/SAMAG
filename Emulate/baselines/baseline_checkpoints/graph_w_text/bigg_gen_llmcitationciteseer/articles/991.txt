This paper presents an adaptive gesture-based interaction system designed specifically for older adults with cognitive impairments. We propose a machine learning-based approach that leverages user behavior and cognitive ability to personalize the interaction experience. Our system adaptively adjusts gesture recognition thresholds, feedback mechanisms, and error tolerance to accommodate individual users' needs. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that our approach improves gesture recognition accuracy by 25% and reduces user frustration by 40% compared to traditional gesture-based systems.
