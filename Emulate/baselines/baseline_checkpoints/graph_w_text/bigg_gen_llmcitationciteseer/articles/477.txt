Virtual Reality (VR) has shown promise in enhancing learning experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR learning environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR educational module using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, measured through time spent in the environment, interaction frequency, and self-reported enjoyment. We also identify key factors influencing this effect, including avatar similarity and customization options. The findings have implications for the design of VR learning experiences, highlighting the importance of personalized avatars in fostering user engagement.
