Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture complex query semantics, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query representation framework, 'GraphQRep', which leverages graph attention mechanisms to model query-document relationships. By constructing a graph of query terms and their co-occurrences, GraphQRep learns to weigh term importance and capture nuanced query semantics. Experimental results on the TREC ROBUST04 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for complex queries, when compared to state-of-the-art query representation models.
