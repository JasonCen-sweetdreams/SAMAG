Temporal graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale network data with temporal dependencies. However, existing indexing techniques suffer from high memory overhead and slow query performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, Hierarchical Bloom Filter Index (HBFI), which leverages the hierarchical structure of Bloom filters to efficiently index temporal graphs. HBFI reduces memory usage by up to 70% and improves query performance by up to 5x compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques. We evaluate HBFI on real-world datasets and demonstrate its applicability to various temporal graph queries.
