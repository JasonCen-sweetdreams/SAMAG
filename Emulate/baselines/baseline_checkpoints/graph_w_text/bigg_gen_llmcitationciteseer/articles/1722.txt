Data warehousing has become a critical component of modern data analytics, but ensuring data integrity and provenance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel blockchain-based approach to scalable and secure data warehousing, 'BlockDW'. We design a distributed ledger architecture that enables tamper-evident and transparent data provenance, while ensuring efficient query processing and data aggregation. Our experiments on a large-scale synthetic dataset demonstrate that BlockDW achieves significant performance improvements over traditional data warehousing solutions, while providing strong guarantees of data integrity and provenance.
