The proliferation of graph-structured data has led to a surge in query optimization research. This paper introduces 'GLIndex', a novel learned index framework specifically designed for massive-scale graph databases. By integrating deep learning-based index structures with traditional query optimization techniques, GLIndex achieves significant improvements in query performance and scalability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GLIndex on several real-world graph datasets, showcasing up to 5x speedup over state-of-the-art query optimization methods.
