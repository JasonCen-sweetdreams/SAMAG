Traditional query expansion techniques rely on manual rules or statistical methods, limiting their effectiveness in modern search engines. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework, 'NQE', which leverages deep learning to learn contextualized query representations. NQE incorporates a novel attention mechanism that captures complex relationships between query terms and documents, enabling more accurate and efficient document retrieval. Experimental results on the TREC dataset demonstrate that NQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and query latency.
