Query expansion is a crucial step in improving the performance of search systems, especially in the medical domain where precise retrieval is paramount. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach for query expansion, dubbed 'MedExpand'. MedExpand leverages a combination of word embeddings and convolutional neural networks to capture the semantic relationships between medical terms and generate high-quality expansion terms. Our experiments on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset demonstrate that MedExpand outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
