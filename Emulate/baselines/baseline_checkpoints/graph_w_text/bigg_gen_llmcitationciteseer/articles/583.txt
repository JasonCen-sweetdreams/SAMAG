This paper investigates the problem of distributed negotiation in multi-agent systems where agents possess incomplete information about the environment and each other's preferences. We propose a novel negotiation strategy, 'INFORM', which integrates probabilistic modeling of agent preferences with iterative negotiation protocols. INFORM enables agents to learn from each other's actions and update their beliefs about the negotiation space, thereby improving the likelihood of reaching mutually beneficial agreements. We evaluate INFORM through extensive simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving higher social welfare and individual utilities compared to existing state-of-the-art negotiation strategies.
