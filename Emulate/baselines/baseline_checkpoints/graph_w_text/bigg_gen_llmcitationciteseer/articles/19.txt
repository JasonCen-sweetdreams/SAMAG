Recommender systems have become ubiquitous, but their opacity hinders trust and understanding. This work proposes 'HAGN', a novel hierarchical attention graph neural network architecture that incorporates item relationships and user preferences to generate personalized recommendations. HAGN's attention mechanism enables explainability by identifying influential items and aspects in the recommendation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGN on three real-world datasets, showcasing improved recommendation accuracy and enhanced explainability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
