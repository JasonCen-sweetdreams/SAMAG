Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but their accessibility for users with disabilities remains a significant concern. This paper presents a novel framework, 'InConverse', which incorporates participatory design principles to develop inclusive conversational interfaces. We conducted co-design sessions with users with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive disabilities to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our framework includes a set of design guidelines and a prototype system that provides real-time accommodations, such as speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and gesture recognition. A user study demonstrates that InConverse significantly improves interaction experience and reduces frustration for users with disabilities.
