Graph pattern matching has emerged as a crucial query processing technique in various applications, including social network analysis and biological data mining. However, its integration with relational databases remains inefficient due to the absence of native graph support. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'Graphix', which leverages relational database indexing techniques to accelerate graph pattern matching. We develop a graph-to-relational schema mapping algorithm and design a hybrid index that combines the benefits of B+-tree and graph indexing. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that Graphix outperforms existing graph pattern matching algorithms by up to 3x, while maintaining compatibility with existing relational databases.
