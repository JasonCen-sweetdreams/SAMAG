Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to capture the semantic relationships between documents and queries. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'LSA-DNN', which leverages latent semantic analysis (LSA) to extract high-level semantic features from documents and incorporates deep neural networks (DNNs) to model complex query-document interactions. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that LSA-DNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IR systems in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, particularly for long-tail queries. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the learned semantic representations and their implications for IR.
