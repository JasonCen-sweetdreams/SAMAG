Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular in modern data management systems. However, their performance is heavily dependent on efficient query optimization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and observing the execution times. Our experimental results on a real-world benchmark dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving up to 3x speedup in execution time. We also provide a detailed analysis of the learned query optimization strategies and their applicability to various database workloads.
