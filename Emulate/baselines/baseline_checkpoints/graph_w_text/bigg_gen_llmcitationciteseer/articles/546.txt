Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between queries and relevant documents. Existing QE methods often rely on shallow semantic representations, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper presents a novel QE approach that leverages hierarchical semantic embeddings (HSE) to effectively capture the nuanced relationships between query terms and their expansions. Our proposed method, dubbed HSE-QE, recursively applies a graph-based neural network to encode the semantic hierarchy of the query and its expansions, resulting in more accurate and diverse expanded queries. Experimental results on several TREC benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of HSE-QE over state-of-the-art QE techniques.
