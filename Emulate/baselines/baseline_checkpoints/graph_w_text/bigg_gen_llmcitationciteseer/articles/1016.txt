Traditional ranking models in information retrieval rely on hand-crafted features and optimization methods, limiting their ability to capture complex document relationships. We propose a novel approach, DeepRank, which leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal ranking policies. Our model utilizes a hierarchical neural network to represent documents and a policy gradient method to optimize ranking metrics. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ranking quality and relevance over state-of-the-art methods.
