Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used to manage large-scale datasets. However, optimizing join orders in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the added complexity of data distribution and communication costs. This paper proposes a novel join order optimization algorithm, 'DJOpt', which leverages a combination of graph-based and machine learning techniques to efficiently explore the join order search space. DJOpt is designed to minimize both computational and communication costs, and experimental results on a real-world DDS testbed demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches.
