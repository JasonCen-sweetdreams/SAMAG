In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages context-aware reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic environments. Our approach, called CARTA, uses a hierarchical policy framework that integrates local and global decision-making, enabling agents to learn from their experiences and adjust their behavior in response to changing task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that CARTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
