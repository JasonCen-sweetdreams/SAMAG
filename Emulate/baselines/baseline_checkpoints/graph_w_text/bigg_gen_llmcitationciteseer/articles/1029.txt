This paper addresses the problem of decentralized coalition formation among autonomous agents with uncertain preferences. We propose a novel framework that integrates Bayesian learning and distributed constraint optimization to enable agents to form coalitions in a decentralized and adaptive manner. Our approach allows agents to update their beliefs about others' preferences and adjust their coalition formation strategies accordingly. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of coalition stability and efficiency, and is scalable to large-scale multi-agent systems.
