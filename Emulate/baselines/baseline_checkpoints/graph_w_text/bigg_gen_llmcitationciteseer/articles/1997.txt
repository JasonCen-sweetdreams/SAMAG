Conversational agents are increasingly being used in various applications, but their lack of emotional intelligence hinders their ability to understand and respond to human emotions. This paper presents a novel framework for designing emotionally intelligent conversational agents that can recognize, understand, and respond to human emotions in a more empathetic and human-like manner. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework and found significant improvements in user satisfaction and perceived emotional understanding. Our results have implications for the design of more empathetic and effective human-agent interaction systems.
