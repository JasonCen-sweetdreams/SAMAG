As Augmented Reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need for more intuitive and natural interaction methods. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction system for AR using deep learning. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) that detects and tracks the user's gaze, allowing for precise and hands-free interaction with virtual objects. Our approach leverages a large-scale dataset of eye movement patterns and achieves a high level of accuracy in gaze estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our system in various AR scenarios.
