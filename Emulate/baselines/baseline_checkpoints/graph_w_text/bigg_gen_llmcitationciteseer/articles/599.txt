Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies heavily on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant contexts for answer extraction. This paper presents a novel dense passage retrieval (DPR) approach, 'DPR-Fast', which leverages a dual-encoder architecture and a hierarchical clustering-based indexing scheme to reduce the computational cost of DPR while maintaining its retrieval effectiveness. We demonstrate the superiority of DPR-Fast over existing DPR methods on several ODQA benchmarks, achieving significant speedups and comparable or better retrieval performance.
