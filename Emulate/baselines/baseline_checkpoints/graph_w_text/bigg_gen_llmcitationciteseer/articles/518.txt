Coordinating multiple agents in complex environments remains a challenging problem in AI research. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture to address this issue. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent relationships and hierarchical representations to capture long-range dependencies. Our approach is scalable to large numbers of agents and can be applied to various multi-agent coordination tasks. Experimental results on a series of benchmarks demonstrate HGAT's effectiveness in improving coordination efficiency and task completion rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.
