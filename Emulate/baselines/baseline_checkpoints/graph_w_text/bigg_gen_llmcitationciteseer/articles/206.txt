Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in modern data analytics, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'SkewOpt', which tackles the problem of skew in distributed query optimization. We propose a probabilistic model to estimate the skew in data distribution and develop a cost-based optimization framework that adapts to the skew. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that SkewOpt improves query performance by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
