Distributed search engines face significant challenges in efficiently retrieving relevant documents from a large corpus. This paper proposes a novel proximity-aware re-ranking approach that leverages the spatial proximity of documents in the index to speed up the retrieval process. Our approach, dubbed 'ProxRank', incorporates a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group documents based on their semantic similarity and spatial proximity. Experiments on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that ProxRank achieves a 30% reduction in query latency while maintaining a comparable level of retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
