Virtual teams are increasingly prevalent, but conflict resolution remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an emotional avatar-based mediation system, 'EmpathyBot', designed to facilitate constructive conflict resolution in virtual teams. EmpathyBot leverages affective computing and social learning theories to create personalized avatars that reflect users' emotional states, enabling more effective empathy and understanding. Our user study with 30 virtual teams shows that EmpathyBot significantly improves conflict resolution outcomes, reduces conflict escalation, and enhances team satisfaction.
