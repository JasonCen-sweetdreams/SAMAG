Accurate and interpretable time-series forecasting is crucial in various applications, including finance and healthcare. This paper introduces 'HATSF', a novel hierarchical attention network that learns to selectively focus on relevant segments of multivariate time-series data. Our approach leverages a stacked self-attention mechanism to capture complex temporal dependencies and identify influential variables. We evaluate HATSF on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved forecasting performance and enhanced explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Visualizations of attention weights provide actionable insights into the forecasting process, enabling users to identify key drivers of predicted outcomes.
