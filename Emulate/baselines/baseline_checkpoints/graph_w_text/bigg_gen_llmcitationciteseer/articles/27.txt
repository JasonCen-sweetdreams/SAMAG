The increasing adoption of virtual reality (VR) technology has sparked interest in enhancing user engagement and experience. This study explores the role of personalized avatars in VR environments, examining their impact on user motivation, self-expression, and overall satisfaction. We designed and implemented a VR system that generates customized avatars based on users' personality traits and preferences. Our user study involving 120 participants reveals that personalized avatars lead to higher levels of engagement, enjoyment, and social presence in VR, particularly among individuals with low self-esteem. The findings have implications for the design of inclusive and engaging VR experiences.
