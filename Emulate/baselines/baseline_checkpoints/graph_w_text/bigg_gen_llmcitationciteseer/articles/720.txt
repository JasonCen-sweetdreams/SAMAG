Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but the impact of embodiment on user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating how embodied avatar representations influence user presence, engagement, and cognitive load in VR environments. Our results show that embodied avatars significantly enhance user presence and engagement, but also increase cognitive load due to the added complexity of motor control. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR systems and highlight avenues for future research.
