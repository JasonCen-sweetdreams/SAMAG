Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their scalability and fault-tolerance. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GIDX', which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to optimize query plans. GIDX uses a combination of graph decomposition and join ordering to reduce the search space of possible query plans, resulting in significant improvements in query execution time. We evaluate GIDX on a real-world dataset and demonstrate an average speedup of 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
