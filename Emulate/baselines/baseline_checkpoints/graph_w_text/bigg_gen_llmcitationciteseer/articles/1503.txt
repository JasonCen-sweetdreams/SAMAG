Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR interfaces can be inaccessible and overwhelming. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible VR interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of usability studies and expert evaluations to identify key design principles, including simplified navigation, high-contrast visuals, and audio cues. We then developed and evaluated a prototype VR system incorporating these principles, demonstrating improved user performance and satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces.
