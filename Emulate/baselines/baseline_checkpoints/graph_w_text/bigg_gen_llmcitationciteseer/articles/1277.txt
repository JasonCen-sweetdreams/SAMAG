This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for autonomous traffic management. We propose a novel algorithm, 'DMARL-TM', which enables autonomous vehicles to learn cooperative policies for traffic signal control and route optimization. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model complex traffic interactions and incorporates a decentralized trust mechanism to ensure robustness against malicious agents. Experimental results using a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate that DMARL-TM outperforms traditional traffic management systems in terms of reduced congestion and travel times.
