Unsupervised representation learning has become a crucial component in many machine learning pipelines. However, existing clustering-based methods suffer from scalability issues, limiting their applicability to large datasets. We propose a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm, 'HierClus', which leverages a divide-and-conquer strategy to efficiently identify dense regions in high-dimensional spaces. Our approach adaptively selects the most informative features at each level of the hierarchy, enabling the discovery of nuanced patterns in the data. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that HierClus outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency.
