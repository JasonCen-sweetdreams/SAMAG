Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide transparency into the decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical graph attention (HGA) framework that leverages both user-item interactions and item attributes to generate personalized explanations. Our approach utilizes a multi-layer graph attention mechanism to capture complex relationships between items and users, resulting in more accurate and interpretable recommendations. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGA in improving recommendation quality and explanation fidelity.
