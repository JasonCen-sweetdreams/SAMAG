Node classification in dynamic networks is a challenging task due to the evolving graph structure and node features. Existing methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between nodes and their temporal dependencies. We propose a Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that integrates node, edge, and graph-level attention mechanisms to learn a hierarchical representation of nodes. Our model adaptively selects the most informative neighbors and time steps to update node representations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several real-world datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in node classification tasks, particularly in scenarios with sparse and noisy data.
