Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, but existing methods often struggle with long-range dependencies and high-dimensional data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that leverages both local and global contextual information. Our HAN model employs a hierarchical structure to capture multi-scale patterns and an attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant input features. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications such as energy demand forecasting and financial prediction.
