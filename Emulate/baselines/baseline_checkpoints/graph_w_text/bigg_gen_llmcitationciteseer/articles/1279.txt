Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but the lack of haptic feedback can lead to a sense of disconnection and reduced user experience. This study investigates the effects of haptic feedback on user engagement, immersion, and task performance in VR environments. We designed a novel haptic feedback system that utilizes electroactive polymers to provide tactile feedback to users. Our user study with 30 participants shows that the inclusion of haptic feedback significantly improves user experience, reduces motion sickness, and enhances task completion rates. The results have implications for the design of VR systems and highlight the importance of haptic feedback in creating an immersive and interactive experience.
