This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in decentralized multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to be assigned tasks in a dynamic environment. We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'Dec-MARTA', which enables agents to learn optimal task allocation policies through decentralized decision-making. Dec-MARTA incorporates a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn task allocation strategies. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that Dec-MARTA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and agent satisfaction.
