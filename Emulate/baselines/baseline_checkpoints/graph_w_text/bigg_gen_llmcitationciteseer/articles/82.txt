Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize the way people interact and engage with digital information. However, people with disabilities often face significant barriers when accessing VR experiences. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive VR experiences for individuals with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with people with disabilities and developed a set of guidelines for accessible VR interaction. Our approach incorporates multimodal feedback, adaptable interfaces, and personalized profiles to ensure equal access to VR experiences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study on a VR-based education platform.
