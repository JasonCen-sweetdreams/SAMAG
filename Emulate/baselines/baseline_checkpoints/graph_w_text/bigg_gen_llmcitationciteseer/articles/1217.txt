Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in healthcare training, but current systems often rely on simplistic controllers, limiting the realism and effectiveness of simulations. We present 'EmbodiVR', a novel multimodal interaction framework that combines hand tracking, voice recognition, and haptic feedback to create a more immersive and engaging experience. Our user study with medical professionals demonstrates significant improvements in procedural accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR training methods. We discuss the implications of EmbodiVR for realistic skill transfer and its potential applications in fields such as surgical training and patient education.
