The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential increase in multimodal sensor data, making it challenging to detect anomalies in real-time. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that integrates convolutional and recurrent neural networks to model complex patterns in sensor data. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weights features across different modalities and time scales, enabling the detection of subtle anomalies. Experimental results on a large-scale industrial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies with high accuracy and low latency, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
