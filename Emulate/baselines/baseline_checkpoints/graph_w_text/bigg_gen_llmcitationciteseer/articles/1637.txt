Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to improve healthcare outcomes by facilitating more empathetic and personalized interactions. However, existing ECAs often neglect the needs of diverse user populations. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive ECAs, incorporating insights from human-centered design and social psychology. We conducted a user study with 30 participants from diverse backgrounds, informing the development of a culturally sensitive and adaptive ECA prototype. Our results demonstrate that our ECA design can increase user trust and satisfaction in healthcare interactions, particularly for underserved populations.
