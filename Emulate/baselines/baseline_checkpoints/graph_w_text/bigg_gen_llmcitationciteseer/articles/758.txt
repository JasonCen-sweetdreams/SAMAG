As large-scale distributed database systems become increasingly prevalent, query optimization plays a critical role in ensuring efficient data retrieval. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraphOpt', which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to optimize query plans. GraphOpt utilizes a hierarchical indexing scheme to prune unnecessary subqueries, reducing the search space and improving query performance. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
