As robots become increasingly prevalent in industrial environments, effective human-robot collaboration (HRC) is crucial for productivity and safety. This paper explores the role of embodiment in HRC, examining how a robot's physical appearance and behavior influence human trust and cooperation. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants in a realistic industrial setting, comparing interactions with a humanoid robot, a robotic arm, and a virtual agent. Our results show that the humanoid robot's embodied presence enhances trust and cooperation, particularly in tasks requiring close proximity and physical interaction. We discuss implications for HRC system design and future research directions.
