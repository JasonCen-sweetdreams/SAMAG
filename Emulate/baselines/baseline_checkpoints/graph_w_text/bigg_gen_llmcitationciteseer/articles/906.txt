Traditional retrieval methods in search engines rely on Euclidean spaces, which struggle to capture complex semantic relationships between documents. This work introduces 'HyperDocRank', a novel neural ranking model that leverages hyperbolic geometry to learn hierarchical representations of documents. By exploiting the properties of hyperbolic spaces, our approach significantly improves retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, especially for long-tail queries. Experimental results on large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of HyperDocRank over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both ranking quality and computational cost.
