Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including fault detection, predictive maintenance, and healthcare monitoring. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HATN) that addresses this limitation. HATN incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant segments of the time series, enabling explainable anomaly detection. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HATN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while providing insightful visualizations of the anomaly detection process.
