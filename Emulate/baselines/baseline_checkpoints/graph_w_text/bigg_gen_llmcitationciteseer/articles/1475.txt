Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information, but existing interfaces often rely on manual input methods that can be cumbersome and detract from the immersive experience. This paper presents EyeTrackingUI, a novel gaze-based interface that leverages eye tracking technology to enable users to navigate and interact with virtual objects in a more natural and intuitive way. We evaluate EyeTrackingUI in a user study, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. Our approach has important implications for enhancing user experience in VR applications.
