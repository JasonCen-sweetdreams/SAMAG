Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep learning-based semantic embeddings to better capture query intent. Our method, dubbed 'EmbedExpan', uses a convolutional neural network to encode query terms and their context into a dense vector space. We then utilize a clustering-based approach to identify semantically similar terms and expand the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmbedExpan significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in retrieval accuracy.
