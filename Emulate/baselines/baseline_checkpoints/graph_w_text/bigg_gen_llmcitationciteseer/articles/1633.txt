Autonomous systems, such as swarms of drones or robots, require efficient task allocation to achieve complex goals. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, 'Distributed Task Assignment using Reinforcement Learning' (DTARL), which enables agents to learn cooperative task allocation policies in a decentralized manner. DTARL utilizes a graph neural network to model agent interactions and environmental dynamics, allowing agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environment conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DTARL outperforms traditional task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
