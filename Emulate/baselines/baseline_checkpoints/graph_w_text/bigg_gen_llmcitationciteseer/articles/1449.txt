This study investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR)-based learning interfaces. We designed an immersive VR environment that simulates real-world physics and compared it to a traditional desktop-based interface. Our user study with 60 participants shows that the VR condition leads to improved understanding and retention of complex concepts in physics education. We also found that participants' body movements and gestures in the VR environment are positively correlated with their learning outcomes. Our findings have implications for the design of embodied VR-based learning interfaces that leverage the cognitive benefits of bodily engagement.
