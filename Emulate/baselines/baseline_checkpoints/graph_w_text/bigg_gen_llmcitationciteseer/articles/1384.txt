In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a novel approach to cooperative task allocation using reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities, available resources, and environmental constraints. Our approach leverages a variant of deep Q-networks to learn optimal task allocation policies that maximize system-level performance. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing response times compared to traditional allocation strategies.
