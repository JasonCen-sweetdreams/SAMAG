Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for business intelligence and decision-making. However, traditional indexing techniques are often ineffective when dealing with skewed data distributions, leading to poor query performance. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, 'SkewIndex', which adapts to the underlying data distribution and dynamically reorganizes the index structure to minimize query latency. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that SkewIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time while maintaining a comparable storage overhead.
