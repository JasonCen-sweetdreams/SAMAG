In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is a crucial task that enables agents to achieve common goals. However, existing approaches often rely on centralized algorithms, which can be vulnerable to single-point failures and lack scalability. This paper proposes a decentralized coalition formation framework that leverages distributed constraint optimization techniques. Our approach allows agents to negotiate and form coalitions in a distributed manner, while ensuring Pareto optimality and fairness. Experimental results on a simulation platform demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing decentralized methods in terms of coalition stability and agent utility.
