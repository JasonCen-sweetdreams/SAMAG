Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges when interacting with computers. This paper presents EyeGaze Keyboard, a novel gaze-based text entry system that enables users to type using their eye movements. Our system leverages a deep learning-based approach to accurately detect and classify gaze patterns, achieving an average typing speed of 15 words per minute with an error rate of 5%. A user study with 15 participants with motor impairments demonstrates the effectiveness of EyeGaze Keyboard in enhancing their computing experience. We also discuss the implications of our system for improving accessibility in human-computer interaction.
