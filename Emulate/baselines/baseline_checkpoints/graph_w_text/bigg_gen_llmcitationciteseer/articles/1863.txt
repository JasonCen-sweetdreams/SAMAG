Recommendation systems often rely on complex models that are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to understand their decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that incorporates interpretable attention mechanisms to identify influential users and items in the recommendation process. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to provide transparent and personalized recommendations while achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our results show that HGAT outperforms existing graph-based methods, and its interpretability facilitates the identification of biases and errors in the system.
