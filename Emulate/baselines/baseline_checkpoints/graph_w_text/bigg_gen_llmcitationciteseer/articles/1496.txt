The increasing adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices has introduced new challenges in anomaly detection and fault diagnosis. This paper proposes a novel graph-based deep learning framework, 'GraphAD', which leverages the structural dependencies between IIoT devices to identify real-time anomalies. We design a graph attention mechanism that integrates device-level features with graph topology, enabling the detection of complex anomalies that evade traditional machine learning approaches. Experimental results on a large-scale industrial dataset demonstrate that GraphAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and latency.
