Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems often struggle with vocabulary mismatch between user queries and relevant documents. We propose a novel query expansion approach, 'MedGE', which leverages hierarchical graph-based embeddings to capture semantic relationships between medical concepts. Our method represents queries and documents as dense vectors in a shared semantic space, enabling more accurate matching and expansion. Experimental results on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset show that MedGE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
