Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach, Qurel, that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans in DDS. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train an RL agent to learn an optimal policy that minimizes query latency. Experimental results on a real-world DDS dataset demonstrate that Qurel outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency, while also adapting to changing workload patterns.
