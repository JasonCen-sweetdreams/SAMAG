Explainable AI (XAI) has become a crucial aspect of trustworthy AI systems. However, existing methods often rely on simplistic feature attribution or saliency maps, which can be misleading or incomplete. This paper introduces a novel causal graph-based approach, 'CausalXAI', which disentangles the complex relationships between input features and model predictions. By leveraging causal inference and graph theory, CausalXAI provides a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of model behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CausalXAI on several benchmark datasets, showcasing its ability to identify causal relationships and uncover hidden biases in AI models.
