Real-time data warehousing has become crucial for businesses to make timely decisions. However, existing indexing techniques struggle with the high volume and velocity of incoming data. This paper proposes a novel, adaptive indexing framework, 'RTIX', which leverages column-oriented storage to efficiently manage real-time data streams. RTIX dynamically adjusts the index structure based on data distribution and query patterns, minimizing storage overhead and query latency. Experimental results on a simulated IoT dataset demonstrate that RTIX outperforms traditional indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time and 2x in terms of storage efficiency.
