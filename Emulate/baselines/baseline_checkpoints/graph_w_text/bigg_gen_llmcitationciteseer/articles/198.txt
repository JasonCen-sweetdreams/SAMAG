Real-time data warehousing has become a critical component of modern business intelligence, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColumnStar', which leverages column-store indexing to accelerate query processing. By adaptively selecting the most effective indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distributions, ColumnStar reduces query latency by up to 75% compared to traditional row-store indexing. We evaluate ColumnStar on a real-world dataset of 100 million records and demonstrate its efficacy in supporting real-time analytics workloads.
