Urban traffic congestion is a pervasive problem that can be alleviated by optimizing traffic signal control. This paper proposes a decentralized, multi-agent system that leverages deep reinforcement learning to coordinate traffic signals in real-time. Our approach, dubbed 'TrafficMAgent', uses graph neural networks to model traffic flow dynamics and learn cooperative policies for adaptive traffic signal control. We evaluate TrafficMAgent in a realistic simulation environment and demonstrate significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional, rule-based control strategies.
