Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it enables the system to better capture the user's information need. Recent studies have explored the use of deep learning models for query expansion, but a comprehensive comparison of different architectures remains lacking. This paper conducts an in-depth evaluation of various neural query expansion models, including recurrent neural networks, transformers, and graph convolutional networks. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that a hybrid approach combining the strengths of these architectures yields significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming traditional query expansion methods and state-of-the-art neural models.
