Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility for individuals with disabilities. However, current VR systems often rely on manual controllers, which can be limiting for users with motor impairments. This paper presents a novel gaze-based gesture recognition system, 'GazeVR', which enables users to interact with VR environments using only their gaze. We employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify gaze patterns into distinct gestures, achieving an accuracy of 92.5% in our user study. GazeVR demonstrates significant potential for enhancing accessibility and promoting inclusive VR experiences.
