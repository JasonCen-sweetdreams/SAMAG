In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized reinforcement learning framework for adaptive task allocation, where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities and environmental constraints. We introduce a novel decentralized Q-learning algorithm that enables agents to learn from their local observations and communicate with neighboring agents to achieve global optimality. Experimental results on a simulated robotics domain demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
