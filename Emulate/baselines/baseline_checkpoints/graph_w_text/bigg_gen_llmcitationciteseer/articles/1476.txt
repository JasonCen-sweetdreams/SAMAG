Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series data is a challenging task due to the lack of labeled data. Existing methods often rely on density-based or distance-based approaches, which may not capture complex patterns in the data. This paper proposes a novel deep hierarchical clustering framework, 'DeepHC', which leverages the representational power of deep neural networks to learn a hierarchical clustering structure from time series data. Our approach enables the detection of anomalies at multiple scales and resolutions, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on several benchmark datasets.
