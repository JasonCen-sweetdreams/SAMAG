Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction (HCI) by leveraging embodied cognition principles. This paper presents an empirical study examining the effects of VR-induced spatial awareness on user performance in a problem-solving task. Our results show that VR participants outperform their desktop counterparts in terms of task completion time and accuracy, while also exhibiting increased cognitive flexibility. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of immersive interfaces and propose a novel framework for integrating embodied cognition into HCI research.
