As data warehouses continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient indexing techniques are critical for real-time query performance. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, 'SkewHash', which leverages skew-tolerant hashing to mitigate the impact of data skew on indexing performance. By adaptively adjusting the hash function to the underlying data distribution, SkewHash achieves significant improvements in query response time and storage efficiency compared to traditional indexing methods. Evaluation on a large-scale data warehousing benchmark demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of SkewHash in supporting real-time analytical workloads.
