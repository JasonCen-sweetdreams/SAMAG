Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel dynamic query expansion approach, 'DREx', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to adaptively refine the search query based on user behavior and relevance feedback. We introduce a multi-agent framework that simulates user interactions and optimizes query expansion policies using a reward function that balances precision and recall. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search effectiveness and efficiency using DREx compared to traditional query expansion methods.
