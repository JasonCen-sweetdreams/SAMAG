As the world transitions to renewable energy sources, smart grids require efficient resource allocation to ensure reliable power supply. This paper introduces 'Agent Harmony', a novel multi-agent system that enables real-time coordination of autonomous agents for resource allocation in smart grids. Our approach leverages a decentralized, hybrid architecture that combines model-free reinforcement learning with constraint-based reasoning to optimize power distribution. Experimental results on a simulated grid demonstrate that Agent Harmony outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of response time, power loss reduction, and adaptability to dynamic demand patterns.
