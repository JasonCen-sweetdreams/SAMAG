 Maintaining materialized views in distributed database systems is crucial for efficient query processing. However, existing approaches are often limited by high maintenance costs and inadequate support for incremental updates. This paper presents 'DynaView', a novel framework that leverages incremental view maintenance and distributed processing to achieve efficient and scalable view updates. DynaView utilizes a delta-based approach to identify and propagate only the necessary changes, reducing maintenance overhead by up to 75%. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate DynaView's superiority over traditional approaches in terms of update latency and resource utilization.
