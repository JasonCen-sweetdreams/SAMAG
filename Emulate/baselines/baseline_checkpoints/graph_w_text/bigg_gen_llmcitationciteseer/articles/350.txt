Keyword extraction is a fundamental task in information retrieval, particularly challenging for short texts due to limited context. This paper introduces HAN-KEX, a novel hierarchical attention network that effectively captures keyword relationships and contextual dependencies. HAN-KEX consists of a word-level attention module to identify important terms and a sentence-level attention module to integrate sentence representations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAN-KEX outperforms state-of-the-art keyword extraction methods, especially for short texts. Our approach has promising applications in search engines, sentiment analysis, and text summarization.
