The proliferation of high-dimensional data has exposed the limitations of traditional indexing techniques, leading to inefficient query processing. This paper proposes a novel indexing method, 'HiDex', which leverages the inherent structural properties of high-dimensional data to enable fast and accurate query execution. HiDex combines a hierarchical clustering-based indexing scheme with a probabilistic query optimization framework, resulting in significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing methods. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HiDex in supporting a wide range of queries, including range, k-NN, and similarity searches.
