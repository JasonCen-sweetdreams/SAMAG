As data warehousing continues to grow in scale and complexity, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper explores the application of column-store indexing to multi-dimensional data warehouses, demonstrating improved query performance and reduced storage overhead. We propose a novel cost-based optimization framework, 'ColOpt', that leverages statistical summaries and machine learning models to predict query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that ColOpt outperforms traditional row-store indexing by up to 3x on complex queries, while reducing storage requirements by 40%.
