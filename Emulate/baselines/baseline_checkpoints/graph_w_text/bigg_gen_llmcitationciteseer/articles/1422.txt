Knowledge graph embeddings have become a crucial component in various applications, such as question answering and recommender systems. However, entity ambiguity hinders the performance of these embeddings. We propose a novel real-time entity disambiguation approach, 'RTED', which leverages graph attention mechanisms and semantic similarity measures to resolve ambiguities. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RTED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of disambiguation accuracy and embedding quality, while maintaining a low computational overhead.
