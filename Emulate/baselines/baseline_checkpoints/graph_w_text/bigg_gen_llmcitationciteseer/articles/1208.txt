Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it helps to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural ranking models to select the most informative expansion terms. We introduce a neural reranking framework that combines lexical, semantic, and contextual features to estimate the relevance of candidate expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the retrieval effectiveness of state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly in cases where the original query is short or ambiguous.
