As data scales, distributed databases face significant performance bottlenecks in query optimization. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraphOpt', which leverages the inherent structure of query graphs to prune unnecessary joins and optimize query plans. We introduce a novel cost model that integrates both data fragmentation and network latency, enabling more accurate estimation of query execution times. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate that GraphOpt reduces query response times by up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
