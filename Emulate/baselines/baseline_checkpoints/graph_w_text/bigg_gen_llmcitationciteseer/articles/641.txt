In complex multi-agent systems, decentralized coordination is essential for efficient decision-making. This paper proposes a novel approach to decentralized coordination using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We introduce a hierarchical DCOP framework, where agents negotiate and exchange information to satisfy constraints and optimize global objectives. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to learn constraint relations and approximate the optimal solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing decentralized coordination algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
