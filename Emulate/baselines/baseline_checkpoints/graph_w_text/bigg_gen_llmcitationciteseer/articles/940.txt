Multi-agent planning with incomplete information is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. This paper proposes a novel decentralized planning framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn coordination strategies among agents. We introduce a probabilistic graph representation to model agent interactions and incomplete information, and develop a GNN-based planner that can reason about probabilistic dependencies between agents. Experimental results on a range of benchmark scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient and scalable planning with incomplete information.
