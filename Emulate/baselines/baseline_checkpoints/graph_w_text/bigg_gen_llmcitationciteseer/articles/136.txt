Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to reduce the search space for answer extraction. This paper introduces HierSent, a novel method for learning hierarchical sentence embeddings that capture both local and global semantic relationships within passages. Our approach leverages a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes sentence embeddings for retrieval and answer extraction. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HierSent outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods, achieving a 15% improvement in top-1 passage retrieval accuracy while reducing computational overhead by 30%
