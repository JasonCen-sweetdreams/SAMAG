Few-shot image classification has seen significant advancements with the advent of meta-learning. However, most existing methods assume that the target classes are stationary across episodes. In real-world scenarios, this assumption is often violated, and the target classes may change over time. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical meta-learning framework, 'HMTL', which adapts to non-stationary target classes by learning a hierarchical representation of task embeddings. We introduce a task-aware attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant task embeddings to improve adaptation to new classes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HMTL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot classification with non-stationary targets.
