Short text retrieval is a challenging task in information retrieval due to the limited context and ambiguity of query terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between words. Our method, called EmbedEx, uses a graph-based algorithm to select expansion terms that are most similar to the original query terms. We evaluate EmbedEx on several short text datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion techniques. Furthermore, we show that EmbedEx is particularly effective for queries with limited context, such as those encountered in microblog search.
