Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with disabilities often face barriers to accessible VR experiences. This paper presents a novel framework, 'IncluVR', that incorporates a set of design principles and guidelines for creating inclusive VR environments. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants with disabilities, identifying key challenges and opportunities for accessible VR interaction. Our findings inform the development of IncluVR, which includes features such as customizable navigation, audio descriptions, and haptic feedback. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in user experience and accessibility.
