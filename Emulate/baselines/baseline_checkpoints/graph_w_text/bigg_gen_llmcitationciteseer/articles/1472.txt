Knowledge graph embedding has become a crucial task in various AI applications, such as question answering and recommender systems. However, existing methods often neglect the hierarchical structure inherent in knowledge graphs, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HATKE', which integrates hierarchical attention networks with graph neural networks to learn more informative and robust embeddings. We evaluate HATKE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in link prediction, entity classification, and graph clustering tasks.
