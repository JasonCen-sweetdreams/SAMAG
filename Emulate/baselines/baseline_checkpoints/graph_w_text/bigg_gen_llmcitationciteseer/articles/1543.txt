Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for timely business intelligence and decision-making. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in real-time data warehousing environments. Our method, called 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the best query execution plans based on runtime statistics and system workload. Experimental results on a popular open-source data warehousing platform demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional rule-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of average query response time.
