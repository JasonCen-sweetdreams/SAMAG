Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their effectiveness is often limited by cultural and linguistic biases. This study investigates the impact of cultural and linguistic adaptation on the usability and acceptability of voice assistants among diverse user groups. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants from five linguistic and cultural backgrounds, examining their interactions with a custom-built voice assistant adapted to their respective cultures and languages. Our results show significant improvements in user satisfaction, task completion rates, and perceived trust when the voice assistant is adapted to the user's cultural and linguistic context. We propose a framework for culturally and linguistically adaptive voice assistants and discuss implications for inclusive design in HCI.
