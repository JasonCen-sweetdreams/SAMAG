Knowledge graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, which hinders their applicability in various domains. Entity disambiguation is a crucial step towards KG completion, as it resolves ambiguity in entity references. This paper proposes a novel graph attention network (GAT) based approach for entity disambiguation, which leverages the graph structure of KGs to capture both local and global context. Our model, 'GAT-ED', outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, achieving a 12.5% relative improvement in disambiguation accuracy. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of GAT-ED in improving KG completion tasks, such as link prediction and entity classification.
