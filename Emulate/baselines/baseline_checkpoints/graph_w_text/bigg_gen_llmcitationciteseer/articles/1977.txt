Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their conversational interfaces often pose accessibility barriers for users with disabilities. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create more inclusive voice assistants. We collaborated with 20 participants with disabilities to co-design and evaluate a novel conversational interface that incorporates multimodal feedback, adaptive speech recognition, and personalized dialogue management. Our results show significant improvements in user experience, task completion rates, and perceived accessibility compared to commercial voice assistants. We contribute a set of design guidelines and a toolkit for developers to create more accessible conversational interfaces.
