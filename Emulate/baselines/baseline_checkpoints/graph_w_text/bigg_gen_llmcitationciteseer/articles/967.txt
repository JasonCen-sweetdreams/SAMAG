Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and network topology. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the distributed database system as a graph, where nodes represent data fragments and edges capture network connections. Our GNN-based query optimizer learns to predict optimal query plans by capturing complex patterns in the graph structure. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
