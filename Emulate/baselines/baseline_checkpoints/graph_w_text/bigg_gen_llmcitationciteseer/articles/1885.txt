In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex, black-box models that lack transparency and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in cooperative and competitive multi-agent scenarios. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents, features, and interactions, providing insight into the decision-making process. Experimental results on a variety of multi-agent environments demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in improving decision accuracy and transparency, while reducing the need for explicit communication between agents.
