In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel autonomous task allocation framework that leverages distributed reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in decentralized networks. Our approach, called 'DARLA', enables agents to learn from local interactions and adapt to changing system dynamics. We evaluate DARLA on a simulated logistics scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and system efficiency compared to traditional heuristic-based approaches.
