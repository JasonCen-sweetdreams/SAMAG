Node classification in graph-structured data is a crucial task in various applications, such as social network analysis and bioinformatics. However, most existing methods require a large amount of labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that tackles the few-shot node classification problem. HGAT leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and features at multiple scales, enabling it to learn effective node representations with limited supervision. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods and achieves competitive performance with fully supervised baselines.
