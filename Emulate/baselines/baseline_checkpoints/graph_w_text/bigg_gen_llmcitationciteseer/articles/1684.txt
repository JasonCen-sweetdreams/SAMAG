Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, but the high computational cost of modern detectors hinders their widespread adoption. This paper proposes a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method, 'EffiDet', which automatically discovers efficient object detection models. We introduce a hierarchical search space that leverages knowledge distillation and a novel 'resource-aware' loss function to optimize both accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate that EffiDet achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing inference time by up to 3.5x compared to existing models.
