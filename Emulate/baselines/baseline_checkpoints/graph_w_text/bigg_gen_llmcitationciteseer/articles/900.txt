Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in data integration, but existing approaches struggle with noisy databases. This paper presents a novel graph-based embedding approach, called 'GDE', which leverages both entity relationships and attribute similarities to disambiguate entities. GDE employs a scalable, distributed framework that can handle large, noisy datasets. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that GDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 12.5% and reducing computational time by 30%. Our approach has significant implications for data quality and integration in various domains.
