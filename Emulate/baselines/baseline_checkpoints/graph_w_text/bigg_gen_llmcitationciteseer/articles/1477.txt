In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that involves assigning tasks to agents to maximize overall performance. This paper presents a novel approach to coalition formation for task allocation in dynamic environments, where agents have varying capabilities and tasks have different priorities. We propose an intelligent coalition formation algorithm that uses machine learning-based negotiation protocols to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Our approach is evaluated through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced agent idle time compared to traditional coalition formation methods.
