Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but current VR interfaces often pose significant accessibility barriers. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CogniVR', a novel VR interface tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We employed a user-centered design approach, incorporating insights from gerontology and cognitive psychology to develop interface elements that accommodate cognitive decline. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to standard VR interfaces. Our findings have implications for the development of inclusive VR systems that promote digital accessibility and social inclusion for older adults.
