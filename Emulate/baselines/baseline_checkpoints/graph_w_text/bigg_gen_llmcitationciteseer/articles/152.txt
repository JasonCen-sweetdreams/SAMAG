In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We consider a scenario where agents with different capabilities and resources need to be assigned tasks with varying requirements. Our approach, based on distributed constraint optimization, allows agents to negotiate and allocate tasks without relying on a centralized authority. We introduce a novel heuristic for estimating the task allocation quality and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulations with varying numbers of agents and tasks. Our results show that the proposed framework achieves near-optimal task allocation while reducing communication overhead by up to 50% compared to existing decentralized methods.
