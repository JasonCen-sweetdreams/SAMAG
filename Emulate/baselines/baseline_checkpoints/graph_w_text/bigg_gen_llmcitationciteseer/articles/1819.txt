Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental task in information retrieval. Document expansion, a crucial step in this process, aims to enrich the original query by incorporating relevant terms from the top-ranked documents. Existing methods rely on statistical techniques, which can be limited by their inability to capture complex semantic relationships. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'DeepExpand', which leverages pre-trained language models to learn a dense representation of the query and documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that DeepExpand outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and recall, while reducing the computational overhead by an order of magnitude.
