Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely on effective query representation to retrieve relevant documents. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach to query expansion, leveraging semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms. Our method, termed GraphExp, constructs a query graph from a knowledge base and applies graph convolutional networks to learn dense representations of query terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphExp outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, particularly for ambiguous and rare queries, while reducing computational overhead.
