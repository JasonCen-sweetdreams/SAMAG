Conversational agents have become ubiquitous in human-computer interaction, but their design often neglects the emotional and social nuances of human communication. This study investigates the impact of emotional intelligence on user experience with conversational agents. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 120 participants, using a chatbot that exhibited varying levels of emotional intelligence. Our results show that agents with higher emotional intelligence led to increased user satisfaction, trust, and empathy. We also identify key design principles for inclusive conversational agents, including contextual understanding, affective feedback, and personalized support. Our findings have implications for the development of more empathetic and effective human-agent interactions.
