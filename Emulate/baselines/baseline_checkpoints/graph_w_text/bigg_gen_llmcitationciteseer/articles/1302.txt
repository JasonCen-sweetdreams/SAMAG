Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively expand user queries, leading to suboptimal search results. We propose a novel context-aware embedding approach, 'CAQE', which leverages semantic relationships between query terms and their contextual neighbors. By incorporating a graph-based attention mechanism, CAQE generates more informative and diverse expansion terms, improving retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate a significant increase in mean average precision and NDCG scores compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
