Distributed search engines have revolutionized the way we retrieve information from large-scale datasets. However, query efficiency remains a significant bottleneck, particularly when dealing with complex queries. This paper proposes an innovative approach to improve query efficiency by incorporating Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) into distributed search engines. We develop a novel indexing technique that leverages the semantic relationships between terms to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves an average query speedup of 3.2x compared to traditional indexing methods, while maintaining a high level of retrieval accuracy.
