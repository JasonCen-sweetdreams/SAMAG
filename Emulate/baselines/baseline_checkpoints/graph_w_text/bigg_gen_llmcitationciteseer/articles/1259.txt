This paper addresses the problem of task planning in multi-agent systems where resource availability is uncertain. We propose a hierarchical task network planning framework that integrates a probabilistic resource model with a planning-as-satisfiability approach. The framework allows agents to reason about resource uncertainty and adapt to changing availability during plan execution. Experimental results on a logistics domain demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of plan success rate and resource utilization. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the framework's computational complexity and completeness.
