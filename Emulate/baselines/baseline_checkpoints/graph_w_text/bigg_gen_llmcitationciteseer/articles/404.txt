Neural retrieval models have revolutionized the field of information retrieval, but their performance can be limited by the quality of the training data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query expansion using pseudo-relevant feedback, which leverages the model's own predictions to generate additional training data. Our method, dubbed 'NeuroExp', iteratively refines the query representation by incorporating feedback from the top-ranked documents. Experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroExp significantly improves the retrieval performance of state-of-the-art neural models, often outperforming traditional query expansion techniques.
