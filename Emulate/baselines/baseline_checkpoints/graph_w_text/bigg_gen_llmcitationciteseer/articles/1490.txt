Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in knowledge graph construction, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in a given context. Existing approaches rely on hand-crafted features or simple neural networks, which fail to capture complex relationships between entities. We propose a novel graph-based neural network approach, 'GED-Net', that leverages the graph structure of the knowledge graph to learn entity representations. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GED-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale knowledge graph construction.
