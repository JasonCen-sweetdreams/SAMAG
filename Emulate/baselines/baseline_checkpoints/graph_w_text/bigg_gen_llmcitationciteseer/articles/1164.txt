In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel agent architecture that combines a graph neural network with a deep Q-network, enabling agents to learn cooperative policies and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain show that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods and achieves near-optimal performance in dynamic environments with varying task demands and agent availability.
