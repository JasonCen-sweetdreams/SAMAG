Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in many applications, including industrial monitoring and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel approach, GraAD, which leverages graph-based attention mechanisms to capture complex patterns in time-series data. We model the data as a graph, where each node represents a time step, and edges encode temporal dependencies. Our approach uses self-attention to weigh the importance of neighboring nodes, enabling the detection of anomalies in real-time. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraAD in detecting anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.
