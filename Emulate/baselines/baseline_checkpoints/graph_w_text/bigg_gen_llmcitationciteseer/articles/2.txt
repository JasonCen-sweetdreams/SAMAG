Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have the potential to improve cognitive functioning in older adults, but their design should consider the unique needs and abilities of this population. This study investigates the impact of embodied cognition on cognitive performance in VR interfaces tailored for older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, aged 65+, who completed cognitive tasks in both embodied and non-embodied VR conditions. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly enhances cognitive performance, particularly in spatial reasoning and memory tasks. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of accessible VR interfaces for older adults.
