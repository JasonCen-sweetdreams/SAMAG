Individuals with motor disabilities face significant challenges when interacting with gesture recognition systems. This paper presents a novel framework for designing adaptive gesture recognition systems that can accommodate diverse motor abilities. Our approach combines machine learning with participatory design methods to develop personalized gesture models that adapt to an individual's unique motor characteristics. We evaluate our system with 15 participants with varying levels of motor impairment, demonstrating significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction. Our findings have important implications for the development of inclusive HCI systems that can be used by people with motor disabilities.
