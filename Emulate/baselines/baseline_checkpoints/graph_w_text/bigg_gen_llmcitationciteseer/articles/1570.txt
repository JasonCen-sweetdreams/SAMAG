Temporal graph databases have become increasingly popular for modeling dynamic relationships in social networks, traffic patterns, and other applications. However, indexing schemes for efficient query processing are still in their infancy. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, called TempoGI, which leverages the temporal locality of graph updates to reduce index maintenance costs. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TempoGI outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of update throughput.
