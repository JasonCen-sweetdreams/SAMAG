In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task allocation approach that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn the complex interactions between agents and tasks. Our method, called Hierarchical Task Allocator (HTA), represents the agent-task graph as a hierarchical structure and uses GCNs to learn task embeddings that capture the dependencies between tasks. Experimental results on a simulated robot swarm scenario show that HTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate and communication overhead.
