Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, especially when faced with novel classes and limited training data. This paper introduces a meta-learning approach, Hierarchical Task Embeddings (HTE), which learns to represent tasks as hierarchical embeddings that capture both inter-class and intra-class relationships. By leveraging these embeddings, our model can adapt to new classes with only a few examples, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. We also provide theoretical insights into the effectiveness of HTE and its ability to generalize to unseen tasks.
