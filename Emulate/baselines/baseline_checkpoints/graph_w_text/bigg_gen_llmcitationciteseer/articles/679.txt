Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have gained popularity for their scalability and convenience. However, optimizing query performance in multi-tenant environments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'QTune', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and query rewriting techniques to minimize response times and resource utilization. We propose a multi-objective optimization approach that balances query performance, fairness, and resource allocation across tenants. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate that QTune outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3.5x in terms of query latency and 2.2x in terms of resource efficiency.
