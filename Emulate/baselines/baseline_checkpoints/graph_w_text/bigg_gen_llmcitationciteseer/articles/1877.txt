Traditional document filtering methods in information retrieval often rely on hand-crafted features and shallow learning models, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a deep neural network-based approach, 'DeepFilter', which learns hierarchical representations of documents and queries to improve filtering accuracy. Our model leverages pre-trained language models and incorporates query-document interaction mechanisms to capture nuanced semantic relationships. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepFilter outperforms state-of-the-art filtering methods, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall.
