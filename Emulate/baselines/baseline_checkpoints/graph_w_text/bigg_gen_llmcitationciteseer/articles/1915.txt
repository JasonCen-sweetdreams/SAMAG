Passage retrieval has become a crucial component in many information retrieval systems. However, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive dense retrieval models or require large amounts of annotated data. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document expansion approach, 'QADE', that leverages sparse representations and document-centric indexing to efficiently retrieve relevant passages. Our method adaptively selects and expands relevant documents based on the query context, reducing the search space and improving retrieval efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QADE outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
