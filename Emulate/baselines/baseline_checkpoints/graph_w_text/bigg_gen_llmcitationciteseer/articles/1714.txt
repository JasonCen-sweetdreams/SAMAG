In heterogeneous multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism, 'HetAuction', which allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, availability, and preferences. HetAuction uses a novel combination of combinatorial auctions and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanisms to ensure truthful bidding and optimal task allocation. Experimental results on a realistic disaster response scenario demonstrate that HetAuction outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time, agent utility, and system scalability.
