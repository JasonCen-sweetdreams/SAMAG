Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, aiming to improve the retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper presents a novel adaptive query expansion approach, dubbed AQE-DNN, which leverages deep neural networks to learn the optimal expansion strategy. AQE-DNN employs a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes the query representation, expansion term selection, and ranking functions. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AQE-DNN outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
