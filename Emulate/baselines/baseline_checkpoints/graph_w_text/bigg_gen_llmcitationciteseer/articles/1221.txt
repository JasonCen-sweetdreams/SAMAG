In this paper, we address the problem of task allocation for autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments. We propose a decentralized approach that leverages both local and global information to optimize task assignments. Our methodology utilizes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where agents learn to adapt to changing environmental conditions and collaborate to achieve shared goals. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized solutions in terms of task completion efficiency and robustness to environmental uncertainty.
