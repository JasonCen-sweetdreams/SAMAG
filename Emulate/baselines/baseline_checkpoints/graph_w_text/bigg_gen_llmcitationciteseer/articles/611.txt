The increasing complexity of modern database systems necessitates efficient query optimization techniques. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'HIRO', which combines the benefits of B-Tree and hash-based indexing. HIRO dynamically adapts to varying query workloads and data distributions, thereby minimizing query latency and improving overall system throughput. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HIRO outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 35% in terms of query response time, while maintaining a competitive storage overhead.
