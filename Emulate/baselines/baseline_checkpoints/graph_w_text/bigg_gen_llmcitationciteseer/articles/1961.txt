This study examines the role of embodiment in fostering social presence in virtual reality (VR) environments. We conducted a user study with 48 participants, randomly assigning them to either a embodied or non-embodied condition. Our results show that users in the embodied condition reported higher levels of social presence, cooperative behavior, and emotional arousal when interacting with a virtual agent. We also found that the sense of embodiment was mediated by the user's perceived agency and self-representation in the virtual environment. The findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to facilitate social interaction and collaboration.
