Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, remains a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and fuse their representations. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers that extract features from each modality, followed by a hierarchical fusion layer that combines the features using attention weights. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal data, achieving an average F1-score of 83.2%.
