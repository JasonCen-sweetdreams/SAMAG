Gamification has been increasingly adopted in educational settings to enhance learner engagement. However, the effectiveness of gamification strategies can be influenced by individual differences in learners' abilities and preferences. This study examines the impact of personalized adaptive difficulty on player engagement in a gamified learning environment. We designed a novel algorithm that dynamically adjusts the difficulty level of game-based learning tasks based on learners' performance, cognitive styles, and emotional responses. Results from a user study with 120 participants show that personalized adaptive difficulty significantly improves learner engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention compared to fixed or adaptive difficulty without personalization.
