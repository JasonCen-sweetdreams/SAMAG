Distributed database systems pose significant challenges in query optimization due to the complexity of data distribution and network latency. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, 'DQO-RLL', learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database environment and receiving rewards based on query execution time. We evaluate DQO-RLL on a real-world distributed database benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance compared to traditional optimization techniques.
