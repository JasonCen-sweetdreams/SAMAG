Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but older adults often struggle with error recovery due to cognitive and motor impairments. This study investigates the effectiveness of various error recovery strategies in voice assistants designed for older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+, evaluating three recovery strategies: explicit error messages, implicit guidance, and adaptive hinting. Our results show that adaptive hinting significantly improves task completion rates and reduces user frustration. We provide design recommendations for accessible voice assistants and discuss implications for future research on error recovery in HCI.
