Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent from short, ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a neural re-ranking approach to query expansion, which leverages a pre-trained language model to generate a set of contextualized candidate terms. Our method, dubbed 'NeuQE', incorporates a novel term importance estimation module that adaptively weights the contribution of each expansion term based on its semantic relevance to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving state-of-the-art retrieval performance.
