Virtual reality (VR) has shown immense potential for remote social interactions, but users often report feeling disconnected from others. This paper presents an embodied avatar system, 'AvatarPlus', which incorporates subtle nonverbal cues and personalized gestural behaviors to enhance social presence in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that AvatarPlus significantly improves perceived co-presence, social bonding, and overall VR experience. Our findings have implications for designing more engaging and empathetic virtual social interactions.
