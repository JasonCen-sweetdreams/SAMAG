Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but their accessibility for visually impaired users remains a significant concern. This study investigates the design of inclusive chatbots that cater to the needs of visually impaired individuals. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving user interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify key accessibility barriers and design requirements. Our findings inform the development of a novel chatbot framework, 'AccessibleConverse', which integrates assistive technologies such as screen readers, Braille displays, and voice commands. We demonstrate the efficacy of AccessibleConverse in improving conversational experience and user satisfaction for visually impaired users.
