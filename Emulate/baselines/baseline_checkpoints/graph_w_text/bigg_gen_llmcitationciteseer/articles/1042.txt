Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but existing VR interfaces often exclude people with disabilities. This paper presents a novel, inclusive VR interface design framework that incorporates accessibility features for users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a user study with 30 participants with diverse abilities and identified key challenges and opportunities in VR interaction. Our proposed framework, 'AccessibleVR', includes a set of design guidelines, a software development kit, and a virtual assistant to facilitate accessible VR experiences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AccessibleVR through a case study on a VR-based education application.
