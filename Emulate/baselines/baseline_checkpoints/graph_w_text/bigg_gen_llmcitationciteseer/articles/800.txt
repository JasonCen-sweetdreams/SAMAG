Coordinating multiple agents in complex environments is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture for multi-agent coordination. HGAN learns to represent agent interactions as a hierarchical graph, allowing it to capture both local and global dependencies between agents. We evaluate our approach on a variety of multi-agent scenarios, including traffic management and resource allocation, and demonstrate significant improvements in coordination efficiency and overall system performance compared to existing approaches.
