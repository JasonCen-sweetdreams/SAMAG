This paper addresses the problem of coordinating autonomous agents to efficiently allocate resources in dynamic environments. We propose a novel multi-agent framework, 'DynaAlloc', which integrates machine learning-based demand forecasting, decentralized decision-making, and real-time adaptation to environmental changes. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and optimize resource allocation. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate that DynaAlloc outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of resource utilization, response time, and adaptability to changing demands.
