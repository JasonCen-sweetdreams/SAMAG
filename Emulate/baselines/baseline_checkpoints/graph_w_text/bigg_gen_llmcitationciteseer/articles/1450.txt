Expert search systems struggle to retrieve relevant documents due to the complexity of user queries. This paper proposes a neural query expansion approach, 'NQE-ES', which leverages a deep learning model to generate context-aware query expansions. NQE-ES learns to identify relevant terms and phrases from a large corpus of expert-annotated documents, and incorporates these into the original query. Experimental results on the TREC Expert Search dataset demonstrate that NQE-ES significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a 23% increase in retrieval precision and a 17% decrease in query latency.
