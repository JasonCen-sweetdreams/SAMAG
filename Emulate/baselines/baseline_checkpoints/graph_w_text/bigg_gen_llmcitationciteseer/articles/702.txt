Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained popularity in recent years, but existing methods often rely on simplistic user-item interaction graphs. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention (HGA) framework that models complex relationships between users, items, and attributes. HGA leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant graph components, enabling the discovery of nuanced patterns and relationships. We evaluate HGA on three real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art ERS methods.
