Multi-agent systems often require coordinating heterogeneous agents to accomplish complex tasks. Existing approaches rely on manual task assignment or limited adaptability to changing environmental conditions. We propose a novel framework, 'HTA-DRL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to dynamically assign tasks to agents based on their capabilities, current workload, and environmental factors. HTA-DRL is evaluated in a simulated rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates, reduced response times, and enhanced system adaptability compared to traditional approaches. Our method enables more efficient and effective coordination of heterogeneous agents in dynamic environments.
