Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. Traditional methods often struggle to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HierCon', which leverages contrastive learning to learn robust representations of time series data. We employ hierarchical clustering to identify anomalies at multiple scales, allowing for the detection of both local and global anomalies. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HierCon in improving detection accuracy and reducing false positives compared to state-of-the-art methods.
