Ad-hoc retrieval systems often rely on query expansion to improve retrieval effectiveness. However, existing methods may not fully capture the semantic relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach, 'GraphExpan', which leverages semantic embeddings to model query term relationships. GraphExpan constructs a query graph by incorporating word embeddings and semantic role labeling, and then applies a graph-based ranking model to select the most informative expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC Ad-hoc dataset demonstrate that GraphExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
