Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the robustness of GNNs by incorporating hierarchical attention mechanisms. Our method, 'HierAttn', adaptively focuses on relevant subgraphs and node features to mitigate the effects of adversarial perturbations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierAttn significantly enhances the robustness of GNNs against targeted attacks while maintaining their performance on clean data.
