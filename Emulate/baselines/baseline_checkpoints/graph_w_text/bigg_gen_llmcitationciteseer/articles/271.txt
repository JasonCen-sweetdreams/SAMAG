Predicting protein-ligand binding affinity is a crucial task in drug discovery and design. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this domain, but often struggle to capture complex interactions between protein and ligand structures. We propose a hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, AttentiveGNN, which leverages multi-scale graph attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant substructures and interactions. Our experiments on a benchmark dataset of protein-ligand complexes demonstrate that AttentiveGNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.23 kcal/mol.
