Virtual reality (VR) systems are increasingly being used in various domains, but their security remains a significant concern. This paper presents a novel gaze-based authentication system for VR environments using deep learning techniques. Our approach leverages the unique characteristics of VR head-mounted displays to capture users' gaze patterns and uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn discriminative features. Experimental results on a dataset of 100 users show that our system achieves a high accuracy of 97.5% and outperforms existing authentication methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in a real-world VR application, providing a promising solution for securing VR systems.
