Time-series data has become increasingly prominent in various applications, from IoT to financial analytics. However, existing main-memory database systems struggle to efficiently support secondary indexing for time-series data, leading to poor query performance. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, called TS-Index, which leverages the inherent temporal locality of time-series data to reduce indexing overhead. TS-Index integrates a compact in-memory data structure with a lazy update mechanism, achieving significant improvements in query throughput and memory efficiency. Our experimental evaluation on real-world time-series datasets demonstrates that TS-Index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x.
