Main-memory databases have gained popularity due to their improved performance and low latency. However, optimizing index selection for multi-dimensional range queries remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel cost-based approach, 'DIMON', which leverages statistical models to estimate query selectivity and identify the most effective index configuration. We develop a set of heuristics to prune the search space and reduce the optimization time. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that DIMON outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 30% in terms of query response time and I/O efficiency.
