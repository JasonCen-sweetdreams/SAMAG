Distributed database systems (DDS) struggle with optimizing queries involving joins, especially in the presence of data skew. Existing solutions either focus on single-node optimization or rely on static join ordering, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper presents ElasticQuery, a novel query optimization framework for DDS that adaptively reorders joins based on runtime data statistics. By incorporating a skew-aware join ordering algorithm and a cost-based optimization strategy, ElasticQuery improves query execution time by up to 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of ElasticQuery in handling complex queries with diverse data distributions.
