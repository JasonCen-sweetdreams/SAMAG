Main-memory database systems (MMDBs) have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to provide high performance and low latency. However, query optimization in MMDBs remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We design a DRL-based query optimizer that learns to select the best execution plan for a given query by interacting with the MMDB environment. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of execution time and memory usage.
