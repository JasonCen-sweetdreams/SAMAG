Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their accessibility for older adults remains a concern. This study investigates the speech patterns of older adults interacting with voice assistants, focusing on factors such as cognitive load, speech rate, and linguistic complexity. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, using a specially designed voice assistant prototype. Our results show that older adults exhibit distinct speech patterns, including slower speech rates and more frequent pauses, which can lead to errors in voice assistant interactions. We propose a set of design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants, including adaptive speech recognition and personalized feedback mechanisms.
