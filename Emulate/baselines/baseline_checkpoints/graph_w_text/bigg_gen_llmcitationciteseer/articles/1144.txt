Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, aiming to improve the retrieval performance by augmenting the original query with relevant terms. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, leveraging semantic embeddings to capture the contextual relationships between words. Our method, called DeepQE, employs a graph neural network to learn a dense representation of the query and its expansion terms, outperforming traditional methods based on term frequency and co-occurrence analysis. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepQE in enhancing the retrieval precision and recall.
