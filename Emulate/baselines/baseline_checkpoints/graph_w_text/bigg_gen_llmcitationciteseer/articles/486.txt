As data continues to grow, distributed database systems face significant challenges in optimizing query processing. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query planning and execution in distributed databases. Our proposed framework, 'RL-QueryOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan based on the database workload and system dynamics. We demonstrate that RL-QueryOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 50% in reducing query latency and improving system throughput. Experiment results on a real-world distributed database benchmark show the effectiveness of our approach in various query workloads.
