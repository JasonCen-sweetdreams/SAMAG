Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has witnessed significant progress with the advent of dense passage retrieval (DPR) models. However, these models are computationally expensive and require large-scale indexing infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense passage embedding (HDPE) approach that leverages a hierarchical clustering-based indexing strategy to reduce the retrieval complexity. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDPE achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art DPR models while reducing the inference time by 3.5x. We further analyze the effectiveness of HDPE in various ODQA scenarios, including cross-domain and few-shot settings.
