The increasing amount of online information necessitates efficient and effective document retrieval systems. This paper proposes a neural passage retrieval model that leverages BERT-based re-ranking to improve the ranking quality of top retrieved documents. Our approach combines a dense passage retriever with a BERT-based re-ranker, which fine-tunes the model to capture semantic relationships between queries and passages. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ranking accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art retrieval models.
