Distributed databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but efficient query processing remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'DRIAD', that accelerates multi-dimensional range queries in distributed databases. DRIAD leverages a hierarchical indexing structure that adapts to the data distribution and query patterns, reducing the number of nodes involved in query processing. We evaluate DRIAD on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing indexing techniques, achieving an average query response time reduction of 35%.
