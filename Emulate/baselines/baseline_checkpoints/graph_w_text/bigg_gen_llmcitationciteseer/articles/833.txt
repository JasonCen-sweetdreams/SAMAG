This paper presents a novel approach to designing gestural interfaces for older adults with motor impairments. We propose an adaptive system that utilizes machine learning to recognize and accommodate individual users' abilities, compensating for motor limitations. Our system incorporates a gesture recognition module, a motor ability assessment framework, and a personalized interface adaptation mechanism. A user study with 20 older adults with motor impairments demonstrates significant improvements in interaction accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional gestural interfaces. Our findings have implications for the development of inclusive and accessible HCI systems.
