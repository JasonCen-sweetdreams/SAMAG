This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating autonomous agents in smart grid management using hierarchical task networks (HTNs). Our approach, called Agent-HTN, enables agents to reason about high-level goals and decompose them into smaller, actionable tasks that can be executed in a distributed manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Agent-HTN in a simulated smart grid environment, where it achieves improved efficiency and resilience compared to traditional centralized control methods. Additionally, we provide a formal analysis of the system's scalability and fault tolerance.
