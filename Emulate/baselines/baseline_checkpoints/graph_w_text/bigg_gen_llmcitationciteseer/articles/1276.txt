Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR systems often fail to account for their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel VR system that incorporates cognitive support tools, simple navigation, and personalized feedback. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in user engagement and cognitive performance compared to traditional VR systems.
