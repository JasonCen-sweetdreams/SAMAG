Node attribute imputation is a fundamental problem in graph data analysis, where missing attributes need to be inferred from available information. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAN) model, which leverages the hierarchical structure of graphs to capture complex dependencies between nodes. HGAN consists of multiple graph attention layers, each of which adaptively assigns importance scores to neighboring nodes based on their attributes. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of imputation accuracy and robustness to noisy data.
