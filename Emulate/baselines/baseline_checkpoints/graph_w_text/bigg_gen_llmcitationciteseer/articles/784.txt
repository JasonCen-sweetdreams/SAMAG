Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing AR systems often neglect the needs of this population, leading to frustration and disengagement. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CARE', an inclusive AR interface tailored to the cognitive and perceptual abilities of older adults. We conducted a participatory design process with caregivers and older adults to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our interface incorporates visual and auditory cues, simplified interactions, and personalized feedback to support wayfinding, memory recall, and social interaction. A usability study with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments demonstrates the efficacy of CARE in improving task completion rates and user satisfaction.
