In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient decision-making to achieve global objectives. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for distributed task allocation, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on local observations and communicates with neighboring agents to achieve global coordination. We introduce a hierarchical policy representation that separates task allocation from execution, enabling agents to adapt to changing environments and task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized methods in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization.
