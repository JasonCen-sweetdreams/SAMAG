Traditional B-tree indexes are often suboptimal for main-memory databases, where memory access patterns and data distributions can be highly irregular. This paper explores the application of learned index structures, which leverage machine learning models to optimize query performance. We propose a novel technique, 'ML-Index', that integrates a learned model with a traditional B-tree to improve query latency and reduce memory accesses. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that ML-Index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x, while requiring minimal additional memory overhead.
