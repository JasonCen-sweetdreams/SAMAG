Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their acoustic design often neglects the needs of older adults, leading to difficulties in communication. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants, focusing on acoustic accessibility for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, exploring the impact of speech rate, pitch, and volume on older adults' comprehension and interaction experiences. Our findings inform a set of guidelines for acoustic design, emphasizing the importance of adaptable speech rates, clear enunciation, and personalized volume control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these guidelines through a prototype voice assistant, showcasing improved comprehension rates and user satisfaction among older adults.
