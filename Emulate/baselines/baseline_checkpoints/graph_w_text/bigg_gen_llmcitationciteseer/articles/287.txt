Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their usability and accessibility limitations can alienate older adults. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create personalized accessibility features for voice assistants, catering to the diverse needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving surveys, interviews, and usability testing with 30 older adults, identifying key design recommendations for improved accessibility. Our proposed framework, 'VoiceEase', incorporates adaptable speech recognition, simplified command structures, and multimodal feedback mechanisms, resulting in a 35% reduction in error rates and a 25% increase in user satisfaction.
