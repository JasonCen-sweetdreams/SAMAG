Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems generate vast amounts of multimodal data, making it challenging for users to interpret and interact with the data. This paper presents 'GazeVista', a novel gaze-based interactive visualization framework that enables users to explore and analyze BCI data in real-time. We utilize machine learning algorithms to predict user intent from gaze patterns, allowing users to select and inspect data segments of interest. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates that GazeVista improves data exploration efficiency by 35% and reduces cognitive load by 28% compared to traditional visualization methods.
