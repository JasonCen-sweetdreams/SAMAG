Distributed database systems (DDBS) are crucial for modern applications, but query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an adaptive data replication strategy, 'ADRe', which dynamically adjusts replication factors based on query patterns and data access frequencies. ADRe leverages machine learning techniques to predict query hotspots and optimize data placement across nodes, reducing latency and improving overall system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world DDBS deployment demonstrate significant performance gains, with average query response times reduced by up to 35% compared to traditional static replication schemes.
