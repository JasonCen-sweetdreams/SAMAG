High-dimensional data indexing is a crucial component of many applications, including similarity search and data analytics. Traditional indexing methods often suffer from poor query performance due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose an adaptive indexing framework, ADIx, which dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. ADIx leverages a novel combination of hierarchical clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques to identify the most informative features and optimize index construction. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and reduced indexing overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.
