This paper introduces a novel decentralized multi-agent coordination framework that leverages hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to enable efficient and scalable decision-making in complex systems. We propose a graph-based representation of the agent interaction space, which allows agents to learn and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Our framework is evaluated on a series of benchmarks, demonstrating improved coordination efficiency and robustness compared to traditional centralized and decentralized approaches. We envision applications in autonomous systems, smart cities, and swarm robotics.
