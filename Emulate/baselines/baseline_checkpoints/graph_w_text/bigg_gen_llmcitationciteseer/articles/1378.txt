Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely heavily on effective query expansion techniques to bridge the vocabulary gap between users and documents. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages the ranking capabilities of deep neural networks to generate high-quality expanded queries. We propose a hierarchical neural model that captures both local and global contextual relationships between query terms and documents. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art query expansion methods, with an average precision gain of 12.5%.
