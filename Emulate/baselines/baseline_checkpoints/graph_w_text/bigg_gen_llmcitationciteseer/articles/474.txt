This study investigates the design of conversational interfaces for older adults using voice-controlled smart home systems. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, exploring their needs, preferences, and challenges when interacting with voice assistants. Our findings highlight the importance of designing interfaces that accommodate age-related cognitive and physical declines. We propose a set of design guidelines and recommendations for developing more accessible and usable voice-controlled systems, including the use of clear and concise language, intuitive voice commands, and visual feedback mechanisms. Our work contributes to the development of more inclusive and supportive smart home technologies for older adults.
