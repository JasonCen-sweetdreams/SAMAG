Predicting protein-ligand binding affinity is crucial for drug discovery, but existing methods often struggle to capture complex interactions between proteins and ligands. We propose a hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) that leverages both local and global structural features of protein-ligand complexes. HAGNN employs a novel attention mechanism to selectively focus on key residues and interactions, leading to improved prediction accuracy and interpretability. Extensive experiments on the PDBbind dataset demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.23 kcal/mol.
