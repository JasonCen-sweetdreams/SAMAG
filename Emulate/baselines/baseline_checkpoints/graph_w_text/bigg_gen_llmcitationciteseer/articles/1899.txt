Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper proposes a robust deep learning framework, 'TransAD', that leverages transfer learning to improve anomaly detection performance. We demonstrate that pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on image datasets can be effectively fine-tuned on time-series data, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. Our approach is robust to varying anomaly types and densities, outperforming traditional statistical methods and shallow machine learning models. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the efficacy of TransAD in detecting anomalies in time-series data.
