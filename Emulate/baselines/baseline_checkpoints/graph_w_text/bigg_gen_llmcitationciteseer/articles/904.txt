In multi-agent systems, efficient resource allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. However, centralized approaches are often limited by scalability and robustness issues. This paper presents a decentralized autonomous system (DAS) that enables agents to self-organize and adapt to dynamic environments. We propose a novel negotiation protocol that leverages machine learning-based preference modeling and iterative bargaining to allocate resources efficiently. Simulation results on a smart city scenario demonstrate that DAS outperforms traditional centralized and distributed approaches in terms of resource utilization and response time.
