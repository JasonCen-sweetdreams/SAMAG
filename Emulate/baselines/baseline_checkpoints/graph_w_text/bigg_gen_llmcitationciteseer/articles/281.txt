Neural search models have shown significant improvements in retrieval performance, but their computational overhead hinders their deployment in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-NS', that reduces the number of neural model invocations while maintaining retrieval effectiveness. HQE-NS leverages a multi-level representation of the query, iteratively expanding it using a combination of lexical and semantic techniques. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that HQE-NS achieves significant efficiency gains, with an average reduction of 35% in neural model invocations, while retaining 95% of the original retrieval performance.
