Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and use a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query execution. Our approach is able to adapt to changing workload and system conditions, and experimental results show significant improvements in query response time and system throughput compared to traditional optimization techniques.
