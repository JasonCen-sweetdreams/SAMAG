As the global population ages, designing inclusive interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments is crucial. This paper presents 'ElderVoice', a voice-based interface framework tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive decline. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, combining user-centered design with cognitive assessments. Our results show that ElderVoice's simplified language model, acoustic adaptations, and personalized feedback mechanisms significantly improve task completion rates and user satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for accessible HCI design and future research directions.
