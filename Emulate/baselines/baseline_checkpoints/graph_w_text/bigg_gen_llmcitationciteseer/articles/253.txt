Individuals with speech and language disorders often face significant barriers when interacting with voice-based interfaces. This paper presents a novel design framework, 'AccessibleVoice', which incorporates insights from speech-language pathology and human-computer interaction to improve the accessibility of voice assistants. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with speech and language disorders, resulting in the identification of key design principles for enhancing interface intelligibility, error tolerance, and user experience. A prototype voice-based interface implementing these principles was evaluated, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates.
