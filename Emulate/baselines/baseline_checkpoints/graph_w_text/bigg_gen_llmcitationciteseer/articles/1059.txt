Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing engaging VR experiences remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of personalization on user engagement in VR interfaces. We conducted a series of user experiments using a novel VR platform that adaptively adjusts its visual and interactive elements based on users' preferences, goals, and behavioral patterns. Our results show that personalized VR experiences lead to increased user satisfaction, reduced cognitive load, and improved task performance. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of future VR systems and highlight opportunities for further research.
