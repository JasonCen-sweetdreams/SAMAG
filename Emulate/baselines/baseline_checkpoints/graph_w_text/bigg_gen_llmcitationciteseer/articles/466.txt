Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) is a crucial technique for ensuring data consistency in distributed databases. However, existing indexing methods struggle to efficiently support MVCC, leading to performance degradation. This paper presents 'DynIndex', a novel indexing approach that leverages a combination of versioned B-trees and delta-encoding to minimize storage overhead and optimize query performance. We demonstrate through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset that DynIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in MVCC environments, achieving up to 35% improvement in query latency and 25% reduction in storage costs.
