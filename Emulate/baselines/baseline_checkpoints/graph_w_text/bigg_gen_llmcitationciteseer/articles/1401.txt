The increasing complexity of modern datasets has led to a surge in query processing times, hindering the performance of database systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HyperIndex', which tackles the problem of efficient query processing for multi-dimensional data. HyperIndex leverages a combination of grid-based indexing and adaptive tree structures to minimize disk I/O and optimize query execution. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HyperIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving an average query time reduction of 35% and a storage overhead of less than 10%.
