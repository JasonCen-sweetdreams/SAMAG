This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems by leveraging hierarchical task networks (HTNs). We introduce a hierarchical planning framework that enables agents to reason about both local and global goals, and to dynamically adapt to changes in the environment. Our approach is evaluated in a simulated robot soccer domain, where we demonstrate improved team performance and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized planning methods. Theoretical analysis and empirical results show that our HTN-based coordination mechanism scales to large teams of agents and is robust to agent failures and uncertainties.
