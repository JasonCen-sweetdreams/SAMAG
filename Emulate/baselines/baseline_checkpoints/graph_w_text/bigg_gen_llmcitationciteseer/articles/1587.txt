Few-shot learning of rare diseases is a challenging task due to the scarcity of training data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages the hierarchical structure of medical ontologies to improve the learning of rare disease classifiers. Our HAN model adaptively focuses on relevant features and ontological concepts, enabling effective learning from limited data. We evaluate our approach on a realistic dataset of rare diseases and demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods.
