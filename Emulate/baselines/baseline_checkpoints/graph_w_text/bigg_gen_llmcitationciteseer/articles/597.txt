As the global population ages, there is a growing need to design intuitive interfaces for older adults. Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have shown promise in facilitating natural human-computer interaction, but their impact on cognitive load is not well understood. This study investigates the effect of ECAs on cognitive load in older adults using a mixed-methods approach. We developed an ECA-based system for completing daily tasks and evaluated its effectiveness in reducing cognitive load compared to a traditional graphical user interface. Results show that the ECA-based system significantly reduced cognitive load and improved user satisfaction, suggesting a promising avenue for designing accessible interfaces for older adults.
