Individuals with upper limb impairments face significant challenges when interacting with digital systems. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interface designed to provide assistive capabilities for individuals with limited hand dexterity. Our system, 'EasyReach', utilizes a machine learning-based gesture recognition approach that can detect and classify a set of 12 predefined gestures, including grasping, pointing, and manipulation actions. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that EasyReach significantly improved interaction accuracy and reduced fatigue compared to traditional mouse-based interfaces.
