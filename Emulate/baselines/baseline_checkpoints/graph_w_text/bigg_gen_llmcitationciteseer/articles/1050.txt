Explainable planning is crucial for trustworthy autonomous systems, yet existing methods often lack transparency and flexibility. This paper introduces Hierarchical Task Networks (HTN-XP), a novel planning framework that integrates symbolic task planning with neural network-based plan recognition. HTN-XP represents plans as hierarchical graphs, enabling explicit modeling of task dependencies and abstraction levels. We demonstrate that HTN-XP outperforms state-of-the-art planning methods in explainability, scalability, and plan quality on a range of autonomous driving scenarios. Our approach has significant implications for real-world autonomous systems, where transparency and accountability are essential.
