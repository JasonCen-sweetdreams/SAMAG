As urban populations continue to grow, traffic congestion has become a major challenge for cities worldwide. This paper presents a novel approach to urban traffic management using multi-agent systems coordinated by hierarchical task networks (HTNs). We develop a decentralized agent architecture that integrates traffic signal control, route optimization, and traffic prediction to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. Our experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate that the proposed HTN-based approach outperforms traditional traffic management methods, achieving a 23% reduction in average travel time and a 17% decrease in congestion.
