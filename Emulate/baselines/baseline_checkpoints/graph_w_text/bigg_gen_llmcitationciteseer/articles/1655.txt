Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is a challenging task due to the complexity of relationships between variables. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural network-based approach, 'HiTS', which leverages both local and global patterns in the data to identify anomalies. HiTS consists of multiple levels of neural networks, each processing a subset of variables and their correlations. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HiTS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and false alarm rate, making it a promising solution for real-time monitoring and decision-making applications.
