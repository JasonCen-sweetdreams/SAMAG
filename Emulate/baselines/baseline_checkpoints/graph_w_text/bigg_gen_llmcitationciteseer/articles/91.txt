In task-oriented multi-agent systems, forming coalitions dynamically is crucial for efficient task allocation and execution. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'DynaCoal', which leverages graph neural networks to model agent relationships and predicts optimal coalition structures in real-time. DynaCoal integrates a decentralized decision-making mechanism, enabling agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DynaCoal outperforms existing coalition formation methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utility, and communication overhead.
