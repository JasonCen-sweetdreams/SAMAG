Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR), particularly when dealing with short and ambiguous queries. This paper introduces a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NQE-Filter', which leverages a dual-encoder architecture to learn query-document relevance. Our method first generates a set of correlated sub-queries using a neural query expansion module, and then applies a filtering mechanism to prune irrelevant documents. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that NQE-Filter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing the computational cost by up to 30%.
