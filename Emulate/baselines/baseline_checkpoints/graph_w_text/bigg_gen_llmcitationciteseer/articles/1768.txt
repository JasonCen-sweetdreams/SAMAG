This paper explores the role of emotional intelligence and empathy in chatbot design, with a focus on creating more inclusive and supportive human-computer interactions. We conducted a user study with 100 participants, analyzing their interactions with a chatbot prototype that employed empathetic responses and emotional intelligence-based dialogue management. Our results show that users perceived the empathetic chatbot as more trustworthy and helpful, particularly among participants with anxiety or depression. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing more empathetic and supportive chatbots that cater to diverse user needs and abilities.
