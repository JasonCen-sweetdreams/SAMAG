Distributed column-store databases have become increasingly popular for big data analytics, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'Colix', which combines the benefits of column-store indexing with those of row-store indexing. Colix adaptively selects the most suitable indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution, reducing query latency by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques. We evaluate Colix on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving query performance, scalability, and resource utilization.
