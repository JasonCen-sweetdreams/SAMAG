Traditional ranking models for document retrieval rely on sparse, hand-crafted features that fail to capture user preferences and contextual nuances. We propose a neural ranking framework, 'DeepRank', which leverages deep learning to learn dense, personalized representations of documents and users. Our approach integrates a multi-task learning objective that jointly optimizes relevance, novelty, and diversity metrics. Experimental results on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate that DeepRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction.
