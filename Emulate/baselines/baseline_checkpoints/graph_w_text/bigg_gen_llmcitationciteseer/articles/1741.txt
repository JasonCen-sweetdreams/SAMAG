As data warehouses continue to scale, distributed query optimization becomes increasingly critical. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, 'DyIndex', which leverages probabilistic data structures and adaptive sampling to efficiently process queries in cloud-based data warehouses. DyIndex reduces query latency by up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques, while maintaining high accuracy and adaptability to dynamic workloads. We evaluate DyIndex using a real-world dataset from a leading e-commerce platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing query processing times and improving overall system throughput.
