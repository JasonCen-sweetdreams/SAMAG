Multi-agent systems often rely on complex interactions to achieve cooperative goals. This paper introduces HeteroGAT, a novel graph attention framework that enables explainable cooperation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. By integrating agent-specific attention mechanisms with graph neural networks, HeteroGAT captures nuanced relationships between agents and their environments. We demonstrate improved cooperation and interpretability in a variety of scenarios, including traffic management and disaster response. Our results show that HeteroGAT outperforms existing approaches in terms of both task performance and explainability.
