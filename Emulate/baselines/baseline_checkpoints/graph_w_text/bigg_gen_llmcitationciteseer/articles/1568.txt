With the increasing scale of modern databases, query response time has become a critical performance bottleneck. This paper presents a novel adaptive caching framework, 'CacheFlex', designed to optimize query response time in distributed database systems. CacheFlex leverages machine learning-based predictive modeling to dynamically adjust cache sizes and content, taking into account workload patterns, data access frequencies, and system resource availability. Our experimental evaluation using the TPC-C benchmark demonstrates that CacheFlex achieves up to 35% reduction in average query response time compared to state-of-the-art caching strategies, while maintaining a low cache miss rate.
