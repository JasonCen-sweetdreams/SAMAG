Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on simplistic term frequency-based approaches. This paper proposes a novel context-aware embedding-based query expansion framework, 'CAQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and their contexts. We demonstrate that CAQE significantly improves retrieval performance on standard benchmarks, particularly for ambiguous and multi-faceted queries. Furthermore, we show that CAQE can be efficiently integrated with existing retrieval architectures, making it a practical solution for real-world search engines.
