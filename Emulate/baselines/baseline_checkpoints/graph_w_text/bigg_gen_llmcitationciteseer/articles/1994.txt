Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complexity and ambiguity of patent documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages deep semantic embeddings to capture the nuanced relationships between patent concepts. Our approach, called PatentSE, uses a combination of word embeddings and graph convolutional networks to learn a dense representation of patent documents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PatentSE on a large-scale patent dataset, showing significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach has important implications for patent search and innovation management.
