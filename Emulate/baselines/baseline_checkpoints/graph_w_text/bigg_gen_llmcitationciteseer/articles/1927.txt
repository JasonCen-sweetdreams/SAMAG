Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it helps to bridge the lexical gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion, leveraging deep neural ranking models to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'NeuralExp', integrates a pre-trained language model with a ranking-based neural network to generate context-aware expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuralExp outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, yielding significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and robustness.
