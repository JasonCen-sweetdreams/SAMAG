Main-memory database systems have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics. However, existing indexing techniques for time-series data are not optimized for main-memory scenarios, resulting in poor query performance. This paper presents 'TS-Index', a novel indexing scheme specifically designed for real-time time-series data in main-memory database systems. TS-Index leverages the properties of main memory to reduce index creation time and improve query performance. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that TS-Index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 5x in query latency and 3x in index creation time.
