Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but their design often neglects the needs of users with visual impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to visually impaired users. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with visually impaired participants to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a novel conversation flow management system, 'VoiceGuide', which utilizes multimodal feedback and adaptive prompts to facilitate more efficient and enjoyable interactions. A user study demonstrates that VoiceGuide significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
