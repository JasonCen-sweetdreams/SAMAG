Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods often rely on simplistic user-item interaction data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that incorporates both user and item embeddings, as well as their interactions, to provide personalized and interpretable recommendations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on three benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.
