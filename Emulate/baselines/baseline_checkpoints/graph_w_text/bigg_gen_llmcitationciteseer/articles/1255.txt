Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively rank documents when the query contains ambiguous or nuanced terms. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural ranking model, 'DocEx', which incorporates document expansion techniques to capture semantic relationships between query terms and document content. Our approach leverages a novel graph-based neural network architecture that jointly learns term weights, document representations, and query-document interactions. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in ranking accuracy and robustness to query ambiguity compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
