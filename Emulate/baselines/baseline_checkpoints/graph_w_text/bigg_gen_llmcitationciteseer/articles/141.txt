Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and suffer from limited scalability. This paper presents a neural query expansion approach, dubbed 'NeuQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate semantic embeddings for queries and documents. NeuQE adaptively selects relevant expansion terms by optimizing a novel scoring function that balances relevance and diversity. Experiments on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
