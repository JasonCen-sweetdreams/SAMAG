Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval systems to improve the recall of relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query expansion, where keywords are represented as nodes in a graph and their relationships are captured through edge weights. We introduce a novel scoring function that leverages the graph structure to identify the most relevant expansion terms. Experiment results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of mean average precision and recall.
