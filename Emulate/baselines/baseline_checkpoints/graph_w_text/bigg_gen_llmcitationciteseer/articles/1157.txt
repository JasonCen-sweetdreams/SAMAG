Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but it can be computationally expensive and may not always improve retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion based on hierarchical document representation. We propose a multi-level document embedding model that captures both local and global semantic relationships between terms and documents. Our experiments on several standard IR datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
