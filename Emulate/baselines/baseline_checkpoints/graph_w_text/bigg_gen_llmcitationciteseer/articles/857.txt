Virtual reality (VR) systems can significantly benefit from understanding users' intentions to provide more natural and efficient interactions. This paper presents a novel approach to detect users' intentions in VR environments using gaze-based analysis. Our system, called 'GazeIntent', leverages machine learning models to classify users' gaze patterns into distinct intention categories, such as selection, navigation, or exploration. We evaluate GazeIntent in a user study involving a VR gaming application and demonstrate a significant reduction in user frustration and improvement in task completion times.
