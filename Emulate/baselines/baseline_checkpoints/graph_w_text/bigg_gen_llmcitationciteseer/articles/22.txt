This paper addresses the problem of coordinating large numbers of autonomous agents in complex, dynamic environments. We propose a novel distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) framework that enables agents to reason about their local constraints and negotiate with neighboring agents to find a globally optimal solution. Our approach leverages a hierarchical decomposition of the problem space, allowing agents to focus on local optimization while still ensuring global consistency. Experimental results on a logistics domain demonstrate that our DCOP framework outperforms existing coordination methods in terms of scalability and solution quality.
