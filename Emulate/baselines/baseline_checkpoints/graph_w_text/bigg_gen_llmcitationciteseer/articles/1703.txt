Few-shot learning (FSL) has made significant progress in recent years, but its robustness to distribution shifts and noisy data remains a major concern. This paper introduces a novel approach to FSL, dubbed 'AdaptiveMargin', which leverages a self-adaptive margin loss function to improve model robustness. Our method dynamically adjusts the margin based on the support set's similarity to the query images, allowing the model to generalize better to unseen classes. We conduct extensive experiments on popular FSL benchmarks, demonstrating that AdaptiveMargin outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.
