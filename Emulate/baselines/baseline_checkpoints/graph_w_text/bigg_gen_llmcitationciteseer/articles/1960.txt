Real-time data warehousing has become crucial in modern analytics, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQOpt', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in real-time data warehouses. We design a customized neural network architecture that learns to predict optimal query plans from a vast space of possible plans. Our experiments on a real-world data warehouse demonstrate that DeepQOpt achieves an average query response time reduction of 37% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
