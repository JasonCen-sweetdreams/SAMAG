Virtual reality (VR) systems have seen significant advancements in recent years, but user interaction remains a major bottleneck. This paper explores the potential of gaze-based interaction in VR, leveraging eye-tracking technology to enable users to select and manipulate virtual objects. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our gaze-based interaction system, comparing it to traditional controller-based interaction. Results show that gaze-based interaction improves user experience and reduces task completion time, particularly for tasks requiring precision. We also identify key factors influencing user performance, including gaze accuracy and cognitive load.
