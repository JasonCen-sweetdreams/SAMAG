Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often overlooks the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered study on conversational strategies for inclusive voice assistants. We conducted in-depth interviews and usability testing with 25 older adults to identify pain points and design opportunities. Our findings highlight the importance of explicit feedback, incremental learning, and empathetic responses. We propose a set of design guidelines and demonstrate their effectiveness through a prototype voice assistant, 'ElderGuide', which improved task completion rates by 35% and user satisfaction by 40% compared to a baseline system.
