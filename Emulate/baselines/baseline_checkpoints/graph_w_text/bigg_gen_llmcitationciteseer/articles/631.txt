Smart home automation systems often rely on complex interfaces, which can be challenging for elderly individuals. This paper presents a novel gestural interface, 'EasyHome', designed specifically for elderly users. EasyHome utilizes a combination of computer vision and machine learning to recognize and interpret elderly-friendly gestures, such as waving, pointing, and grasping. We conducted a user study with 20 elderly participants and found that EasyHome significantly reduced error rates and improved overall user experience compared to traditional touchscreen interfaces. Our approach has the potential to promote independent living and improve quality of life for elderly individuals.
