This paper proposes a novel deep learning architecture, Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN), for multi-agent decision-making in complex environments. HAN combines hierarchical graph attention mechanisms with reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn effective communication and cooperation strategies. We evaluate HAN on a suite of benchmarks, including autonomous vehicle coordination and smart grid management, and demonstrate significant improvements in performance and scalability compared to existing methods. Our approach has potential applications in real-world domains such as traffic management, supply chain optimization, and distributed robotics.
