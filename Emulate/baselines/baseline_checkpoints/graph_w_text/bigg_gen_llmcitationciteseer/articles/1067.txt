Domain-specific search engines require efficient and accurate document retrieval mechanisms to cater to the diverse information needs of users. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural network architecture, 'HNN-DR', that leverages semantic embeddings and domain knowledge to improve retrieval performance. We introduce a two-stage retrieval framework that combines a coarse-grained relevance scoring model with a fine-grained ranking model, enabling efficient filtering and ranking of documents. Experimental results on a large-scale domain-specific dataset demonstrate that HNN-DR outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision and a 30% reduction in retrieval time.
