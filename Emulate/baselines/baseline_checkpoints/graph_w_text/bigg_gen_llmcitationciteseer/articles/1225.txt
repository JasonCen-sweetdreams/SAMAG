Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely on effective query expansion techniques to improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepExpan', which leverages deep learning-based document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. We introduce a neural network architecture that jointly learns document and query representations, enabling the generation of context-aware expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness.
