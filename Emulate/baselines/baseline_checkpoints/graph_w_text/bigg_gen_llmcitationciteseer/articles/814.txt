Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular for cloud-based services, but they pose significant challenges in terms of scalability, security, and performance isolation. This paper presents a novel architecture, 'MT-DB', that leverages a combination of data partitioning, encryption, and access control mechanisms to ensure secure and efficient data processing in multi-tenant environments. We evaluate MT-DB using a real-world e-commerce dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance, data security, and resource utilization compared to existing approaches.
