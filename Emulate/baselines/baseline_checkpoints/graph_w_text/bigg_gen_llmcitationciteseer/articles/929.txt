Anomaly detection in high-dimensional data is a challenging task due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel deep autoencoder-based approach, 'HDAE', which leverages the power of hierarchical representations to identify anomalies. Our method uses a stacked denoising autoencoder to learn a robust and compact representation of the data, followed by a one-class SVM to detect anomalies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HDAE on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of detection accuracy and F1-score.
