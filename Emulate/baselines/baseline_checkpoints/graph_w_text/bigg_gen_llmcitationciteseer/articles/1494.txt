Protein structure prediction is a fundamental problem in bioinformatics, and recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results. However, existing methods often neglect the hierarchical nature of protein structures, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN (HAGNN) architecture, which models protein structures as hierarchical graphs and leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant residue-residue interactions. We evaluate HAGNN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in protein structure prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
