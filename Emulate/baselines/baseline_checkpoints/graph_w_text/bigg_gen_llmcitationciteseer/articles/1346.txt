Biomedical information retrieval (BIR) systems rely on effective query expansion techniques to retrieve relevant documents from large repositories. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep neural networks, which learns to capture semantic relationships between terms and generates context-aware expansion terms. Our model, dubbed BioQE, utilizes a combination of word embeddings and convolutional neural networks to identify salient terms and predict their relevance to the query. Experimental results on the TREC 2019 BIR dataset demonstrate that BioQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval precision and recall.
