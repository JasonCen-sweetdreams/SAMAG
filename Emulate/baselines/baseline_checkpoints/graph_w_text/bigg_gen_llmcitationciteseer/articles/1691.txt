This paper presents a study on designing inclusive gestural interfaces for older adults, leveraging machine learning-based gesture recognition. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults to identify common gesture patterns and challenges. We developed a custom gesture recognition system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and evaluated its performance on a dataset of gestures from older adults. Our results show that the system achieves an accuracy of 92.5% and significantly outperforms existing gesture recognition systems. We provide design recommendations for creating accessible and usable gestural interfaces for older adults, highlighting the importance of personalized gesture recognition and feedback mechanisms.
