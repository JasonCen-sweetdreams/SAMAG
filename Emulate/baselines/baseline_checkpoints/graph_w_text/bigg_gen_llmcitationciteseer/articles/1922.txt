Optimizing query execution plans is crucial for efficient performance in distributed database systems. Current approaches rely on hand-crafted heuristics, which often fall short in complex scenarios. This paper presents 'DeepQOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to adaptively generate optimal execution plans. By modeling query optimization as a Markov decision process, our approach learns to navigate the vast space of possible plans and identifies superior solutions. Experimental results on a commercial database system demonstrate that DeepQOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 3.2x, while reducing optimization time by 45%.
