Distributed information retrieval (IR) systems face scalability challenges due to the exponential growth of data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HierIndex', to optimize query processing in distributed IR systems. HierIndex leverages a multi-layered indexing structure to prune irrelevant documents at early stages, reducing the number of nodes involved in query processing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HierIndex through extensive experiments on a large-scale web crawl dataset, achieving up to 40% reduction in query latency and 25% improvement in resource utilization compared to existing indexing techniques.
