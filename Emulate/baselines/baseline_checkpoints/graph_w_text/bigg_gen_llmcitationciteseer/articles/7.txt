Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and resources must coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper presents a novel adaptive auction-based framework, 'AuctionMA', which enables efficient task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. AuctionMA uses a probabilistic bidding strategy that adapts to the agents' task completion probabilities and resource availability, leading to improved system performance and robustness. Experimental results on a simulated search and rescue scenario demonstrate that AuctionMA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization.
