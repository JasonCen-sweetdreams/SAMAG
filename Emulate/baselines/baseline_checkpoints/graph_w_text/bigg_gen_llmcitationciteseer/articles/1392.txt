Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have become increasingly popular, offering scalable and on-demand database resources to multiple tenants. However, query optimization in multi-tenant environments is a challenging problem due to resource contention and varying workload characteristics. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MTQO', which leverages machine learning-based workload classification and predictive modeling to optimize query execution plans. We evaluate MTQO on a real-world DBaaS platform and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
