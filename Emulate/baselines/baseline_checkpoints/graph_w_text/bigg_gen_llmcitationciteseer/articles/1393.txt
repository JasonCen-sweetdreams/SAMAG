Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources to diverse workloads. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'CloudAllocator', which leverages a hybrid actor-critic architecture to optimize resource allocation decisions. By incorporating a graph neural network to model workload dependencies and a proactive exploration strategy to handle uncertainty, CloudAllocator achieves significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments on a real-world cloud platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in dynamic, large-scale environments.
