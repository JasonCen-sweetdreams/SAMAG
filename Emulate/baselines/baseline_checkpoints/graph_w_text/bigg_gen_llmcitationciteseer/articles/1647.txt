Autonomous traffic management systems require efficient decision-making strategies to optimize traffic flow and minimize congestion. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'SMART', which enables scalable and decentralized control of autonomous vehicles. SMART leverages graph neural networks to model complex traffic dynamics and incorporates a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture to facilitate cooperation among agents. Our experiments on a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate that SMART outperforms traditional traffic management approaches, reducing travel times by up to 30% while improving safety and reducing emissions.
