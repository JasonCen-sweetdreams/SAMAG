This paper presents a novel hierarchical task network planning approach for multi-agent systems. We extend the traditional HTN framework to accommodate the complexities of multi-agent coordination, introducing a decentralized planning algorithm that allows agents to reason about their own tasks and goals while considering the plans of other agents. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of scenarios, including disaster response and smart city applications. We show that our method outperforms existing decentralized planning techniques in terms of plan quality and scalability.
