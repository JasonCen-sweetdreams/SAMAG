Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents a participatory study involving 20 participants with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive disabilities. We co-designed and evaluated a novel voice assistant prototype that incorporates accessible features such as customizable speech output, tactile feedback, and gesture-based input. Our findings highlight the importance of inclusive design principles and suggest that participatory methods can lead to more usable and empowering voice assistants for users with disabilities.
