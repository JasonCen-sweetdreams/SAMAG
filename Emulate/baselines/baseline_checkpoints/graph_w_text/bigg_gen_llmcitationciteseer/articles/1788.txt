Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults, who may struggle with complex language interactions. This paper presents a participatory design study involving 20 older adults, exploring the challenges and opportunities of voice assistant design for this demographic. We identify key design recommendations, including simplified language processing, personalized feedback mechanisms, and multimodal input support. Our findings inform the development of inclusive voice assistants that can enhance the daily lives of older adults, fostering independence and social connection.
