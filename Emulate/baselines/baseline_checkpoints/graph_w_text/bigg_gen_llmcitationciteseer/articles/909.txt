Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a widely used technique to improve retrieval performance, but existing methods often rely on simplistic term weighting schemes and ignore the semantic relationships between query terms. In this paper, we propose a neural query expansion model, 'NQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn the semantic representation of query terms and their relationships. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness while reducing computational overhead.
