Distributed database systems often struggle with query performance due to data skew, leading to inefficient resource utilization and slow response times. This paper proposes a novel skew-aware histogram (SAH) approach to optimize query performance in distributed databases. SAH leverages statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to identify data hotspots and adapt histogram construction accordingly. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that SAH reduces query latency by up to 35% and improves resource utilization by 20% compared to traditional histogram methods.
