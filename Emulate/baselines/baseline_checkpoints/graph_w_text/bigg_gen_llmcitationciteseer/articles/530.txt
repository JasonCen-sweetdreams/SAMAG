This paper presents a novel approach to gaze-based interaction with augmented reality (AR) objects using deep learning. Our system, 'GazeAR', uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and track the user's gaze, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict the intended interaction with the AR object. We evaluate GazeAR on a dataset of 20 users interacting with 10 AR objects and demonstrate an average accuracy of 92.5% in intent recognition. Our approach enables intuitive and hands-free interaction with AR objects, and has applications in areas such as gaming, education, and healthcare.
