Individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder characterized by impaired articulation, often face difficulties interacting with voice-based interfaces. This paper presents a co-design approach to create more accessible and usable voice-based interfaces for this population. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with individuals with dysarthria, caregivers, and speech therapists to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a novel speech recognition system that incorporates personalized acoustic models, adaptive error correction, and multimodal feedback mechanisms. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in speech recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
