In multi-agent systems, cooperation is crucial for achieving common goals. However, current methods often rely on complex black-box models, hindering interpretability. This paper presents HAN-MAC, a novel hierarchical attention network that facilitates explainable cooperation among agents. By incorporating attention mechanisms at both the intra-agent and inter-agent levels, HAN-MAC selectively focuses on relevant information and relationships, enabling more effective and interpretable decision-making. We evaluate HAN-MAC on a series of cooperative navigation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and transparency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
