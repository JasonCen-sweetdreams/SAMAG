Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in enhancing learning experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user motivation and interaction in VR-based learning environments. We designed and developed an adaptive avatar system that incorporates user preferences and learning style to create personalized virtual representations. Our user study with 120 participants indicates that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, self-efficacy, and knowledge retention compared to generic avatars. The results have implications for the design of VR-based learning systems and highlight the potential of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience.
