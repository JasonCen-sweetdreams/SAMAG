Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively rank documents for complex queries. We propose a novel document expansion approach that incorporates query-aware context to improve retrieval performance. Our method, 'QEAX', generates a query-specific document representation by combining the original document content with relevant passages from a knowledge graph. We evaluate QEAX on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain compared to state-of-the-art retrieval models.
