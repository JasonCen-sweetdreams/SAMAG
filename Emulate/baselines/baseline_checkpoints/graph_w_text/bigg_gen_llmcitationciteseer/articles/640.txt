As robots become increasingly integrated into human-centric workspaces, understanding the factors that influence human-robot collaboration is crucial. This study investigates the role of embodiment in human-robot collaboration using virtual reality (VR). We designed a VR-based experiment where participants interacted with a robot either through a virtual embodiment (VE) or a traditional screen-based interface. Our results show that VE significantly improves collaboration outcomes, including task completion time and user satisfaction, by enhancing the sense of agency and social presence. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of future human-robot collaboration systems.
