Real-time data warehousing has become crucial for businesses to make timely decisions. However, traditional row-oriented storage systems struggle to handle high query volumes, leading to poor performance. This paper proposes a novel column-oriented storage approach, 'ColStar', designed specifically for real-time data warehousing. ColStar leverages a hybrid storage architecture that combines in-memory column stores with disk-based storage, enabling efficient query processing and reducing storage overhead. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColStar outperforms traditional row-oriented systems by up to 3x in query response time while maintaining comparable storage efficiency.
