This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated task allocation in multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'CATRL', which enables agents to learn cooperative policies for task assignment and execution. Our method leverages a graph neural network to represent agent interactions and a deep Q-network to optimize task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that CATRL outperforms traditional auction-based approaches in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization.
