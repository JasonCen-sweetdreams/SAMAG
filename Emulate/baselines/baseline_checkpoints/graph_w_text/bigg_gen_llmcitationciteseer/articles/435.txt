Virtual reality (VR) systems are increasingly being adopted for various applications, but their accessibility for users with disabilities remains a concern. This paper presents ' GestureKey', a novel gesture-based authentication system designed for accessible VR systems. GestureKey leverages machine learning algorithms to recognize and classify hand gestures, providing an alternative to traditional password-based authentication methods. Our evaluation with 20 participants, including those with motor disabilities, shows that GestureKey achieves high recognition accuracy (>95%) and usability, making it a promising solution for inclusive VR experiences.
