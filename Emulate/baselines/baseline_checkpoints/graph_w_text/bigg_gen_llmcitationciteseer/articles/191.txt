Older adults with cognitive impairments often face difficulties interacting with digital systems. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for voice-based interfaces tailored to this population. We conducted a series of workshops and usability studies to identify design principles that facilitate intuitive interaction, reduce cognitive load, and promote error recovery. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice-based interface, 'EasyTalk', which incorporates features such as simplified language processing, personalized feedback, and adaptive error correction. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
