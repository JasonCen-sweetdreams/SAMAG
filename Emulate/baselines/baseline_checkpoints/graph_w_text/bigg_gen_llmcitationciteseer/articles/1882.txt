Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in many real-world applications, but existing models often lack interpretability. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that integrates feature attention and temporal attention to generate explainable forecasts. Our approach captures complex interactions between variables and time steps, while providing insights into the contribution of each feature to the forecasting process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in terms of forecasting accuracy and explainability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
