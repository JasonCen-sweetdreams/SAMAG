Distributed search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from vast, geographically dispersed collections. This paper presents a novel proximity-aware query expansion approach that leverages semantic relationships between query terms to improve document retrieval. We propose a two-stage framework, where the first stage generates a set of expanded query terms using a graph-based method, and the second stage employs a proximity-aware ranking model to prioritize documents based on their relevance and geographical proximity to the user. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and precision compared to traditional query expansion methods.
