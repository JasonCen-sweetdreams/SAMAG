In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is crucial for achieving common goals. However, in real-world scenarios, agents often have incomplete information about each other's capabilities and preferences. This paper introduces a decentralized coalition formation algorithm, 'DICA', which leverages Bayesian learning and distributed constraint optimization to facilitate coalition formation among autonomous agents with incomplete information. We prove the convergence of DICA to a stable coalition structure and demonstrate its efficacy in a simulated disaster response scenario. Our results show that DICA outperforms existing centralized approaches in terms of coalition quality and robustness to incomplete information.
