Short-text retrieval is a challenging task in information retrieval due to the limited context and ambiguity of short queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep semantic embeddings to capture the underlying semantics of short queries. Our approach uses a graph-based method to integrate term relationships and semantic associations, resulting in more effective expansion terms. Experimental results on several short-text retrieval datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.
