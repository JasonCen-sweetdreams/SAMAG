Multi-tenant database systems require efficient query optimization to ensure satisfactory performance for diverse workloads. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQuery', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in multi-tenant environments. We design a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that adapts to changing workloads and learn optimal query plans using a combination of graph neural networks and Q-networks. Experiments on a real-world benchmark demonstrate that DeepQuery outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
