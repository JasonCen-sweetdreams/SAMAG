This paper presents a novel framework for designing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) that provide emotional support to older adults. Our framework, 'EASE', integrates principles from human-computer interaction, affective computing, and gerontology to create personalized, empathetic, and engaging interactions. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, demonstrating that EASE-based agents can effectively recognize and respond to users' emotional cues, leading to increased feelings of comfort, trust, and social connection. The framework's modular architecture enables easy integration with various sensing and actuation technologies, making it a promising tool for promoting healthy aging and social well-being.
