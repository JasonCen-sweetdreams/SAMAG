Information retrieval (IR) systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent from short, ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural query expansion (HNQE) approach that leverages both lexical and semantic relationships to generate more informative queries. Our HNQE model combines a graph-based keyword extractor with a contextualized language model to generate a set of expanded queries that better align with the user's information need. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, with an average increase of 23.5% in precision and 17.2% in recall over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
