The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to increasing complexity in resource allocation. This paper proposes an autonomous agent-based framework, 'IoT-Agent', which leverages decentralized decision-making to optimize resource allocation in heterogeneous IoT networks. Each agent, representing an IoT device, employs a multi-objective optimization strategy to negotiate resource allocation with its peers. We evaluate IoT-Agent on a realistic IoT testbed and demonstrate significant improvements in network performance, energy efficiency, and adaptability to dynamic network conditions compared to traditional centralized approaches.
