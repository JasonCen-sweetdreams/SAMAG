Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, but its adoption is hindered by a lack of understanding of user experience. This paper explores the role of embodiment, the sense of owning a virtual body, on user experience in VR. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR platform with varying levels of embodiment. Our results show that increased embodiment leads to higher user satisfaction, presence, and emotional engagement. However, we also found that individual differences in body ownership and agency play a crucial role in moderating these effects. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems that prioritize user experience and emotional resonance.
