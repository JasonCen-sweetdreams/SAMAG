With the increasing volume and velocity of big data, real-time data warehousing (RTDW) has become a crucial requirement for various applications. However, existing indexing techniques struggle to provide efficient query processing and data ingestion in RTDW systems. This paper presents a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'HierIndex', which combines the benefits of column-store and row-store indexing. HierIndex leverages a hierarchical data structure to facilitate fast query processing, while adaptively adjusting the indexing granularity based on data distribution and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that HierIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query performance and data ingestion rates.
