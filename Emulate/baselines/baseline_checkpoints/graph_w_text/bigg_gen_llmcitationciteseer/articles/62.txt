In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, traditional centralized approaches are often limited by scalability and robustness issues. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to enable autonomous agents to learn optimal allocation strategies. Our approach, called 'AgentRL', utilizes a multi-agent Q-learning algorithm that incorporates graph-based representations of task relationships and agent capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentRL outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion time and robustness to agent failures in a simulated warehouse management scenario.
