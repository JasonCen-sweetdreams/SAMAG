Virtual assistants (VAs) have become ubiquitous, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the impact of gamification techniques on user engagement with VAs. We designed and developed a VA prototype that incorporates various gamification elements, such as points, badges, and leaderboards. A user study with 100 participants revealed that gamified VAs led to increased user interaction, improved task completion rates, and enhanced overall user experience. Our results provide insights into the effective design of gamified VAs and highlight the potential for gamification to improve human-computer interaction.
