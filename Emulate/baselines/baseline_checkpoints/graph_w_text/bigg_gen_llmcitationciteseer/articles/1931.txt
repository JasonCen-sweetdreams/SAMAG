Proximity search is a fundamental problem in information retrieval, where the goal is to efficiently retrieve the nearest neighbors to a query point in a high-dimensional space. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'Hypersphere++,' which leverages the concept of hyperspheres to reduce the search space and improve query efficiency. We demonstrate that Hypersphere++ outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, including HNSW and Annoy, on several benchmark datasets, achieving up to 3x speedup while maintaining comparable accuracy.
