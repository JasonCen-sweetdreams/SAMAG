Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel hierarchical partitioning approach, called 'HierPart', which leverages a combination of vertical and horizontal partitioning to minimize data redundancy and improve query execution times. We propose a cost-based optimization model that considers query patterns, data distribution, and system resources to dynamically adjust the partitioning scheme. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HierPart can reduce query latency by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art partitioning techniques.
