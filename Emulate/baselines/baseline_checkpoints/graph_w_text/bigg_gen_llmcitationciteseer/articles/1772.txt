As the global population ages, designing accessible interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments becomes increasingly important. This paper presents a novel approach to gestural interface design, 'GestAlt', which uses machine learning to adapt to individual users' abilities and preferences. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults with mild cognitive impairment, demonstrating that GestAlt significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional gestural interfaces. Our approach has implications for the development of more inclusive and supportive technologies for aging populations.
