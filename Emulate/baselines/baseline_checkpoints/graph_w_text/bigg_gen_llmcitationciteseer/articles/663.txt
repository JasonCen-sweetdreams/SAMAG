In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'MATRL', which learns to allocate tasks to agents in a decentralized manner. MATRL utilizes a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture to optimize task allocation. Experimental results show that MATRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications such as warehouse management and disaster response.
