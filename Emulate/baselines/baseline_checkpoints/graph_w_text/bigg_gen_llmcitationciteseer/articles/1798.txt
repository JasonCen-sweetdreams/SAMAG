Ad-hoc retrieval has seen significant improvements with the advent of deep learning-based methods. However, query expansion remains a crucial component in enhancing retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion, leveraging knowledge graph embeddings learned through a deep neural network. Our model, 'KG-QE', effectively captures semantic relationships between entities and expands queries to improve retrieval recall. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that KG-QE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a 12.5% increase in mean average precision.
