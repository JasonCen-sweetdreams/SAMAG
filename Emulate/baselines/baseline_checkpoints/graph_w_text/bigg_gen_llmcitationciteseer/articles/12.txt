Coordinating exploration in multi-agent systems is crucial for efficient decision-making and information gathering. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphAttentionExplore', which leverages graph attention networks to model inter-agent dependencies and coordinate exploration strategies. By incorporating attention mechanisms, our method adaptively focuses on the most informative agents and tasks, achieving improved exploration efficiency and reduced communication overhead. Experimental results on a range of cooperative exploration tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAttentionExplore in enhancing overall system performance.
