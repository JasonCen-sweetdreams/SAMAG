This paper explores the role of emotional avatars in enhancing user engagement and feedback in multimodal human-computer interaction. We propose an emotional avatar-based feedback system, 'EmoAvatar', which incorporates facial expression recognition, sentiment analysis, and speech synthesis to provide users with personalized, empathetic responses. Our user study results show that EmoAvatar significantly improves user satisfaction and perceived system understanding compared to traditional text-based feedback. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of EmoAvatar in various HCI domains, including virtual assistants, e-learning, and affective computing.
