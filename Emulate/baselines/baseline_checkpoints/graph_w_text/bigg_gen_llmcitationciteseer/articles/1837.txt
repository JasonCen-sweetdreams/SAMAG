Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective retrieval of relevant passages from a large corpus. While dense retrieval methods have shown promise, their computational cost hinders their applicability. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NQE', which leverages a lightweight dense retriever to generate context-aware query expansions. By incorporating a learned passage encoder and a query reformulator, NQE achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results on popular ODQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of NQE in reducing the number of required passages while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
