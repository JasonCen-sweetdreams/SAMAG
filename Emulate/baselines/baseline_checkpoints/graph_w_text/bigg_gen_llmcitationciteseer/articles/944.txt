Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, aiming to enrich the original query with relevant terms to improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach, HierGNN-QE, which leverages hierarchical graph neural networks to model the complex relationships between query terms, documents, and their semantic representations. By incorporating both local and global graph structures, HierGNN-QE captures nuanced context-dependent dependencies and yields more effective expanded queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
