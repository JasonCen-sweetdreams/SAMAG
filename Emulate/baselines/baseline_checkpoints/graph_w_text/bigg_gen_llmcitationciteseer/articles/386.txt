Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph-based models. We represent the database schema as a graph and leverage graph neural networks to learn the query optimization strategy. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and scalability compared to traditional optimization techniques.
