Real-time data streams pose significant challenges for traditional indexing techniques in distributed database systems. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, called 'StreamIndex', which leverages a combination of bloom filters and min-hash functions to efficiently index high-volume, high-velocity data streams. We demonstrate the effectiveness of StreamIndex in reducing query latency and improving throughput in experiments on a real-world IoT dataset. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs between index construction time, query performance, and memory usage.
