Autonomous vehicles rely on accurate and efficient object detection to ensure safety. This paper proposes a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework, 'AVOD-NAS', tailored for real-time object detection in autonomous vehicles. AVOD-NAS leverages a differentiable search space and a machine learning-based performance predictor to efficiently identify optimal neural architectures. We demonstrate that AVOD-NAS discovers architectures that outperform state-of-the-art object detectors on the KITTI dataset while achieving significant reductions in computational resources and latency.
