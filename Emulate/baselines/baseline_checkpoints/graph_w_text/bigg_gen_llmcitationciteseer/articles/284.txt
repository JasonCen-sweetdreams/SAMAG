As robots increasingly interact with humans in various settings, it is essential to understand how their embodiment affects social perception. This study explores how people perceive and respond to robots with different levels of embodiment, from abstract avatars to humanoid robots. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment, combining behavioral data with subjective reports, to investigate the impact of embodiment on perceived trustworthiness, likability, and anthropomorphism. Our results show that robots with higher embodiment are perceived as more trustworthy and likable, but also more prone to anthropomorphism. We discuss the implications of these findings for designing robots that effectively interact with humans in various contexts.
