In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel cooperative task allocation approach based on Thompson sampling, a Bayesian heuristic for multi-armed bandits. Our algorithm, 'CATS', adaptively allocates tasks to agents by balancing exploration and exploitation, considering both individual agent capabilities and global system constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of CATS through extensive simulations, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized task allocation methods.
