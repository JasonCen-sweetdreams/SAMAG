Short-text retrieval is a challenging problem in information retrieval due to the limited context available for query representation. This paper explores the use of word embeddings for query expansion to improve the retrieval performance of short-text queries. We propose a novel method that leverages the semantic relationships encoded in word embeddings to generate expanded queries. Our approach is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, and the results show significant improvements in retrieval accuracy compared to traditional query expansion techniques. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different word embedding models and query expansion strategies on retrieval performance.
