State-of-the-art neural ranking models for information retrieval (IR) rely on complex query-document representations, which can be computationally expensive and limit their scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach, Neural Query Graphs (NQG), which represents queries as graph-structured entities and leverages graph neural networks to learn relevance signals. We demonstrate that NQG achieves significant improvements in ranking accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional neural ranking models on several benchmark datasets. Additionally, we show that NQG can be easily integrated with existing IR systems, making it a promising solution for large-scale IR applications.
