This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments and resource utilization. We introduce a hierarchical architecture comprising a high-level task allocator and low-level agent controllers, which learn to coordinate through a decentralized, model-free reinforcement learning approach. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in improving task completion rates and reducing agent collisions, outperforming traditional auction-based methods in complex, dynamic environments.
