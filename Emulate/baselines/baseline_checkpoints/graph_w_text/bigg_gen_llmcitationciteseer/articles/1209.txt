Online meetings have become an essential part of remote work, but they often suffer from low engagement and participation. This paper presents EyeGazePing, a novel system that utilizes eye gaze tracking to detect and respond to users' attention and interest in real-time. Our system uses a machine learning model to analyze participants' eye movements and generate personalized 'pings' to encourage more active participation. We conducted a user study with 30 participants and found that EyeGazePing increased meeting engagement by 35% and reduced distractions by 27%. Our results demonstrate the potential of gaze-based interfaces to enhance online meeting experiences.
