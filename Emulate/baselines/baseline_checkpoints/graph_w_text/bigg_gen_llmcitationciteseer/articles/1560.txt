Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their usability for users with disabilities remains a significant concern. This paper investigates the impact of conversational strategies on the accessibility of voice assistants for individuals with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a series of user studies to identify design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants, including the use of multimodal feedback, adaptive dialogue management, and personalized assistance. Our findings highlight the importance of considering disability-specific needs in voice assistant design and provide a framework for creating more inclusive conversational interfaces.
