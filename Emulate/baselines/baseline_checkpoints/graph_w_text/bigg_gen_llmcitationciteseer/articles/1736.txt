This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to improve learning outcomes. We design and evaluate a gesture-based interaction system that leverages users' bodily movements to enhance their understanding of complex concepts. Our study involves 30 participants who learn about spatial reasoning and geometry in a VR environment. Results show that the gesture-based interaction group outperforms the control group in terms of knowledge retention and transfer, highlighting the potential of embodied cognition in VR-based education. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of more effective and engaging learning experiences.
