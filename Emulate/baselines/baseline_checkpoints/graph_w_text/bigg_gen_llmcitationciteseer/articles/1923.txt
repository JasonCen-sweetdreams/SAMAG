Open-domain question answering (ODQA) models often struggle to provide comprehensive answers due to the inherent limitations of retrieval-based approaches. This paper presents a novel diversified deep retrieval framework, DDR, which leverages multiple retrieval strategies to gather a diverse set of relevant passages. Our approach integrates a question-dependent passage ranking module with a passage aggregation network to generate coherent and comprehensive answers. Experimental results on the ODQA benchmark demonstrate that DDR outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of answer completeness and ROUGE scores, while maintaining comparable performance in terms of answer accuracy.
