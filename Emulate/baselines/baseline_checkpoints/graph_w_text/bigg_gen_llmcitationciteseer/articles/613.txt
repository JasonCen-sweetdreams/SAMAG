This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems for traffic management using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). We propose a two-level HRL framework, where the high-level policy learns to allocate tasks to agents, and the low-level policy learns to execute tasks in a decentralized manner. Our approach is evaluated on a realistic traffic simulation environment, demonstrating significant improvements in traffic flow and reduction in congestion compared to traditional optimization methods. We also analyze the robustness of our approach under varying traffic conditions and agent failures.
