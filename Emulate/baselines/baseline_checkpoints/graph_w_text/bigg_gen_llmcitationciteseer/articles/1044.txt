Real-time analytics has become increasingly important in various domains, but traditional indexing techniques often struggle to keep up with the velocity and variety of modern data. This paper presents an adaptive indexing framework, 'AIQ', which dynamically adjusts its indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. AIQ leverages a novel cost-benefit model that considers both query performance and indexing overhead, enabling real-time analytics on large-scale datasets. Experimental results on a popular benchmark dataset demonstrate that AIQ outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time while maintaining a comparable storage footprint.
