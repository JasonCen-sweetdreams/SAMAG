Conversational search systems aim to retrieve relevant passages in response to user queries. However, the effectiveness of these systems is often hindered by the limited context and ambiguity of user queries. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based query expansion approach, 'QLEx', that leverages pre-trained language models to generate context-aware, semantically enriched queries. We evaluate QLEx on several conversational search datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in passage retrieval precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
