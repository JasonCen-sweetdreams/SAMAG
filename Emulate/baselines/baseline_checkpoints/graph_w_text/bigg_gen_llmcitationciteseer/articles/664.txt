Distributed database systems face the challenge of optimizing query execution plans to minimize latency and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. Our method, 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. We evaluate RL-QOpt on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
