Few-shot node classification in graph-structured data is a challenging task, especially when dealing with limited labeled nodes. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HATT-GNN) that leverages both local and global structural information. HATT-GNN adaptively selects relevant nodes and their features at multiple scales, allowing it to learn robust node representations from few labeled examples. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HATT-GNN, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification tasks.
