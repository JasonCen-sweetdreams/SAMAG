The increasing adoption of NoSQL databases has led to a surge in column-oriented storage systems. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the lack of a unified cost model. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and adaptive indexing. We introduce a column-store aware cost model that captures data distribution, storage layout, and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColOpt reduces query latency by up to 3x compared to existing optimization techniques, while minimizing indexing overhead.
