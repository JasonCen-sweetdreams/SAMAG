Knowledge graph embeddings have become increasingly popular for various AI applications, but their lack of interpretability hinders their adoption in high-stakes domains. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for explainable knowledge graph embeddings. HGAT incorporates multi-scale attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant graph structures and entities, thereby generating more informative and interpretable embeddings. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving link prediction and entity classification tasks, while providing insights into the graph attention patterns.
