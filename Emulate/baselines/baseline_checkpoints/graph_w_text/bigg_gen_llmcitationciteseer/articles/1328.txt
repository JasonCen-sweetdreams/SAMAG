Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach to scalable query optimization, which leverages graph neural networks to model query dependencies and optimize join ordering. Our approach, called GraphOpt, outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of execution time and scalability. We evaluate GraphOpt on a range of benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to handle complex queries and large-scale datasets.
