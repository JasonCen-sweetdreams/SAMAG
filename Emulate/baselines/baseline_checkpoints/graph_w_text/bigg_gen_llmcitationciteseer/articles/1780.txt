Real-time information retrieval (IR) systems require efficient document filtering to reduce latency and improve user experience. This paper presents an adaptive thresholding approach, 'AdaFilter', which dynamically adjusts the filtering threshold based on the query characteristics and document relevance distributions. Our method leverages a novel online learning framework to update the threshold in real-time, resulting in significant improvements in filtering accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results on the TREC news dataset demonstrate that AdaFilter outperforms existing filtering methods, achieving a 30% reduction in filtering time while maintaining a 95% recall rate.
