In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires agents to coordinate and make decisions with incomplete information. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation algorithm that leverages graph neural networks to learn communication protocols and allocate tasks efficiently. Our approach is robust to incomplete information and adapts to changing agent capabilities and task requirements. We evaluate our algorithm on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized methods.
