The proliferation of big data and cloud computing has led to the widespread adoption of distributed database systems. However, the complexity of query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DistOpt', which leverages a combination of machine learning and database-specific heuristics to optimize query plans. We introduce a probabilistic cost model that accurately estimates the execution time of query plans and a reinforcement learning-based optimizer that adaptively adjusts the query plan based on runtime feedback. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that DistOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
