Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQR', for query reformulation. We leverage a transformer-based architecture to model the semantic relationships between query terms and generate a set of reformed queries that better align with the user's information need. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that DeepQR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query reformulation techniques, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
