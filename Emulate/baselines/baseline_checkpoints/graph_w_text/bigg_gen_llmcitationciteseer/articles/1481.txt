Neural search engines have revolutionized information retrieval by leveraging deep learning models to capture semantic relationships between queries and documents. However, they often struggle with query ambiguity and scarcity, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'SemExpan', which utilizes semantic embeddings to generate high-quality expansion terms. SemExpan combines a neural query encoder with a graph-based expansion mechanism, allowing it to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and their contextualized meanings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
