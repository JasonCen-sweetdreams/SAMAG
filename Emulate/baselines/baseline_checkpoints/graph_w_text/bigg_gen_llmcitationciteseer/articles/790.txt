Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval to improve the retrieval performance. Existing methods often rely on term-based representation, which may not capture the semantic relationships between documents. This paper proposes a novel clustering-based document representation approach, ClusRep, which leverages document clustering to identify latent topics and enrich the query representation. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ClusRep outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision and recall, while reducing the computational overhead.
