In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized auction-based mechanism for task allocation, where agents bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We propose a novel auction protocol, 'Distributed Vickrey Auction', which ensures truthfulness and individual rationality. Our approach is scalable, flexible, and resilient to agent failures. Experimental results on a realistic scenario demonstrate that our method outperforms existing centralized and decentralized approaches in terms of task completion rate and overall system utility.
