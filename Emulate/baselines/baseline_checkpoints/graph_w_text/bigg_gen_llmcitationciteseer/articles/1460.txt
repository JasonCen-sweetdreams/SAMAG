This paper presents a novel approach to designing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) for emotional support in virtual reality (VR) environments. We propose an ECA framework that integrates emotional intelligence, empathy, and social presence to provide users with a sense of comfort and trust. Our system utilizes machine learning-based sentiment analysis and natural language processing to respond to users' emotional cues, and a 3D avatar with expressive gestures and facial expressions to convey empathy. A user study demonstrates the efficacy of our ECA in reducing stress and anxiety levels in VR, highlighting its potential for mental health support and therapy.
