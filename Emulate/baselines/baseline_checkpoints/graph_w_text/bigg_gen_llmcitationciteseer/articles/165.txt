In multi-agent systems, incomplete knowledge about the environment and other agents' intentions can lead to suboptimal decision-making. This paper presents a novel hybrid reasoning framework that integrates symbolic and probabilistic methods to address this challenge. Our approach leverages answer set programming to compute logical consequences of incomplete knowledge, while probabilistic graphical models capture uncertainty and conditional dependencies. We evaluate our framework in a scenario of cooperative task allocation, demonstrating improved decision quality and robustness compared to existing approaches.
