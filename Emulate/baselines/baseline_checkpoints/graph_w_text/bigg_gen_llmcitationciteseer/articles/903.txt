In this paper, we propose a novel approach to autonomous task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, called Multi-Agent Task Allocation with Deep Q-Networks (MATADQN), enables agents to learn optimal task assignment policies in complex, dynamic environments. We evaluate MATADQN in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced response times compared to traditional methods. The proposed approach has significant implications for real-world applications, such as search and rescue operations, and warehouse management.
