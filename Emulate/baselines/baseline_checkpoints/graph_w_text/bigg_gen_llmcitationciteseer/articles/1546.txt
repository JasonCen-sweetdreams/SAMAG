In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism, called 'Distributed Auction for Task Allocation' (DATA), which enables autonomous agents to bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We theoretically analyze the properties of DATA, including its incentive compatibility and allocative efficiency, and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations on a variety of task allocation scenarios. Our results show that DATA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of both task completion time and agent satisfaction.
