We present a novel decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to optimize task assignment and execution. Our approach, called 'AgentTA', utilizes a hierarchical graph neural network to model agent interactions and task dependencies. We demonstrate that AgentTA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to dynamic environments. Experimental results on a simulated drone swarm scenario show that AgentTA achieves a 25% reduction in task completion time compared to state-of-the-art decentralized allocation algorithms.
