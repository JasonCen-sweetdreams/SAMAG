Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has become a popular approach for ad-hoc search, but its effectiveness is heavily reliant on the quality of the input query. This paper proposes a reinforced query expansion (RQE) framework that iteratively refines the query representation by incorporatinLearning from user interactions. Our RQE model employs a deep reinforcement learning agent that learns to select the most informative expansion terms based on the retrieval results and user feedback. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DPR methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
