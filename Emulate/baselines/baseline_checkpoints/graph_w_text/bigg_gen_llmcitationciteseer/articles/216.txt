Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem in various domains, such as robotics, traffic management, and smart grids. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning with graph attention to learn effective coordination strategies. Our method, called Graph Attention Multi-Agent Q-Network (GAMAQN), utilizes a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn optimal actions. Experimental results on a traffic signal control problem demonstrate that GAMAQN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of coordination efficiency and adaptability to changing environments.
