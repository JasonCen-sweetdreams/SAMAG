In multi-agent systems, trust modeling is crucial for effective collaboration and decision-making. However, traditional approaches rely on simplistic trust metrics or assumed trust structures. We propose a novel adaptive trust model, 'GraphTrust', which leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn dynamic trust relationships between agents. GraphTrust incorporates agent features, interaction history, and contextual information to predict trust scores. We evaluate our approach on a simulated multi-agent system and demonstrate significant improvements in trust accuracy and resilience to malicious agents compared to state-of-the-art methods.
