Forest fires are complex phenomena that require accurate modeling to inform fire management strategies. This paper presents a novel hierarchical agent-based model (HABM) for spatially-explicit forest fire simulations. Our approach integrates multiple scales of fire behavior, from individual tree-level interactions to landscape-level fire spread. We utilize a multi-agent system to represent trees, fires, and environmental factors, allowing for realistic simulations of fire dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional cellular automata-based approaches. The HABM framework has significant implications for wildfire risk assessment and mitigation.
