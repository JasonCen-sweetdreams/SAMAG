Older adults with cognitive impairments face significant challenges in interacting with modern computing systems. This paper presents a novel gesture recognition system, 'CogniGest', designed to adapt to the unique needs of this population. CogniGest utilizes a probabilistic framework to dynamically adjust gesture recognition thresholds based on user performance, reducing errors and improving system accessibility. We conducted a user study with 20 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional, non-adaptive approaches. Our findings have important implications for the design of inclusive, cognitively supportive interfaces.
