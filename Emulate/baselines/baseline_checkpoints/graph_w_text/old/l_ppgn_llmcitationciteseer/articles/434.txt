Retrieving the top-K most similar documents to a query in high-dimensional spaces is a fundamental task in information retrieval. Existing indexing methods suffer from poor scalability, leading to high query response times. We propose a novel indexing scheme, called 'HyperCube', which leverages the inherent structure of high-dimensional data to reduce the indexing size and improve query efficiency. HyperCube employs a hierarchical decomposition of the data space, enabling fast pruning of irrelevant regions and effective caching of frequently accessed data. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that HyperCube achieves up to 5x query speedup and 3x indexing space reduction compared to state-of-the-art methods.
