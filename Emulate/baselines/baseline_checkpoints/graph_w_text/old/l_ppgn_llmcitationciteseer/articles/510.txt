Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph query languages and the distributed nature of the data. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph summarization and distributed query rewriting to reduce query latency and improve system throughput. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world social network dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
