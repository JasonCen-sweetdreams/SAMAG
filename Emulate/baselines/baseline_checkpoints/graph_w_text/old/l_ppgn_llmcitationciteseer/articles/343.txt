Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, but traditional methods often struggle to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms. This paper introduces ACE-QE, a novel query expansion framework that leverages adaptive contextualized embeddings to model query-term interactions. By dynamically adjusting the embedding space based on the query context, ACE-QE improves the retrieval of relevant documents and reduces the impact of query drift. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACE-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant gains in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
