Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, query optimization remains a challenging task due to the complexity of distributed systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workloads and system configurations. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan based on runtime statistics and feedback from the database. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
