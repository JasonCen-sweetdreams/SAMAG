Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a scalable framework, 'QueryRL', that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database environment. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that QueryRL outperforms traditional optimization techniques, achieving an average query execution time reduction of 30% and a 25% improvement in system throughput.
