In multi-agent systems, trust management is crucial for facilitating cooperation and preventing malicious behavior. This paper proposes a decentralized trust management framework, 'DLT-TM', which leverages distributed ledger technology (DLT) to provide a secure, transparent, and tamper-evident trust infrastructure. DLT-TM utilizes a permissioned blockchain to record and update agent interactions, enabling trust scores to be computed and shared among agents in real-time. We evaluate the performance and security of DLT-TM through simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and mitigating malicious behavior in large-scale multi-agent systems.
