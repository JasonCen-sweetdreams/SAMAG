This paper proposes a neural query expansion (NQE) approach to improve the efficiency of document retrieval in limited-domain search applications. Unlike traditional query expansion methods that rely on manual thesaurus construction or pseudo-relevance feedback, our NQE model learns to generate contextualized query representations from a small set of relevant documents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NQE on three limited-domain datasets, showing significant improvements in retrieval performance and reduction in query latency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
