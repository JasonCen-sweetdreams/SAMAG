Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages user-item interactions and item attributes to generate personalized explanations for recommendations. Our model employs a multi-level graph attention mechanism to capture complex relationships between users, items, and attributes. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models in terms of both rating prediction and explanation quality.
