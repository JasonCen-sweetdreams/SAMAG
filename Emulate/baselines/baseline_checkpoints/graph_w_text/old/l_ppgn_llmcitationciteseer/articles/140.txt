Query optimization is a crucial component of modern database systems, as it directly impacts the performance and efficiency of query execution. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on manual tuning and heuristics, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to optimize query execution. Our method uses machine learning models to predict the optimal query plan based on the query workload and data distribution. We evaluate our approach on a real-world database and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and efficiency compared to traditional optimization techniques.
