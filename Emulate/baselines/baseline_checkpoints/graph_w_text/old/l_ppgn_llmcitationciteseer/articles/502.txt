Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large volumes of data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate query optimization as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query execution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x in query execution time.
