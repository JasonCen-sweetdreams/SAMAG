In multi-robot systems, efficient task allocation relies on effective agent communication. This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive communication strategies in agent-based task allocation. Our approach leverages reinforcement learning to optimize communication protocols based on environmental dynamics and team performance. We evaluate our framework in a simulated warehouse scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of varying communication topologies on system performance and provide insights for designing robust multi-agent systems.
