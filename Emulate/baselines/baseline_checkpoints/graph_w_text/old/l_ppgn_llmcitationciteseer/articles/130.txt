Real-time traffic anomaly detection is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAN) that leverages graph-structured traffic data to identify anomalies. HGAN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism, which captures both local and global patterns in traffic flows. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and speed on two large-scale traffic datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in a real-world traffic simulation environment, showcasing its potential for real-time traffic management.
