Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the heterogeneity of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that leverages the strengths of each modality to recognize emotions more accurately. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers that selectively focus on relevant features, followed by a hierarchical fusion layer that combines modalities in a learnable manner. Experimental results on the benchmark Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a weighted F1-score of 0.83.
