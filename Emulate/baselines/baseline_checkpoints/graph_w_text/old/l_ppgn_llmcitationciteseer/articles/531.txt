In multi-agent systems, effective coordination is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper introduces the Adaptive Negotiation Strategy (ANS) framework, which enables agents to dynamically adjust their negotiation tactics based on the evolving environment and opponent behaviors. We propose a novel reinforcement learning approach that integrates graph neural networks to model agent relationships and adapt negotiation strategies. Experimental results on a variety of scenarios demonstrate that ANS outperforms existing negotiation frameworks in terms of convergence speed, fairness, and overall system performance.
