Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem in distributed artificial intelligence. This paper proposes a novel approach based on hierarchical graph attention networks (HGATs) to learn effective coordination strategies. Our method leverages the structural properties of agent interactions to identify key agents and their relationships, and then applies attention mechanisms to selectively focus on the most critical agents and their interactions. We evaluate our approach on a series of benchmark problems and demonstrate significant improvements in coordination performance compared to existing methods. The results have important implications for the development of autonomous systems, robotic teams, and other distributed AI applications.
