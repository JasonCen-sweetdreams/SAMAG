Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern technology, but their usability for older adults remains a significant concern. This paper presents a multimodal approach to designing accessible conversational interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+, examining the effects of speech, text, and gesture input modalities on task completion rates and user experience. Our results show that a hybrid approach combining speech and gesture input significantly improves interface accessibility, while our proposed accessibility metrics provide a reliable means of evaluating conversational interface usability for older adults.
