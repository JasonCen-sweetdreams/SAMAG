The increasing adoption of RDF (Resource Description Framework) for data representation has led to a surge in large-scale graph datasets. Query optimization for these datasets is crucial for efficient data retrieval. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach for distributed RDF graphs, which reduces query latency by up to 3x compared to existing methods. Our approach leverages graph partitioning and incremental indexing to facilitate fast query execution. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our proposed method.
