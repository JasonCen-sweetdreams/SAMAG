Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. Our method, called 'QOptRL', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy from a large dataset of query executions. We evaluate QOptRL on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution times compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
