Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies to identify key design principles and guidelines for accessible VR interactions. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and adaptability in VR interface design for this population. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a case study on a VR-based cognitive training application.
