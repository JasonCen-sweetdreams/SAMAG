Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships in large-scale datasets. However, optimizing query performance for distributed graph databases remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, subquery decomposition, and parallel execution to minimize query latency. We evaluate GraphOpt on various real-world graph datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing query optimization techniques.
