Explainability is a critical aspect of modern recommendation systems, as it enables users to understand the reasoning behind suggested items. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships. HGAT learns to attend to relevant user and item features, as well as their interactions, to generate personalized recommendations. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance and explainability compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach provides a more transparent and trustworthy recommendation system, which can be applied to various applications, such as e-commerce and content streaming.
