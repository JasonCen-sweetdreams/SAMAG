Conversational interfaces have the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing systems often fail to account for their unique needs. This paper presents a design framework for accessible conversational interfaces that incorporates insights from cognitive psychology and HCI. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 older adults with cognitive impairments, resulting in a set of design guidelines for simplifying language, reducing cognitive load, and providing emotional support. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a case study of a conversational assistant for medication reminders, which showed significant improvements in user engagement and task completion.
