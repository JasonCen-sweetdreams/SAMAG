Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuroXpand', which learns to expand queries by capturing semantic relationships between terms. Our model combines a graph-based neural network with a contrastive learning objective, enabling efficient expansion of queries while preserving their original intent. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroXpand outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while requiring minimal additional computational resources.
