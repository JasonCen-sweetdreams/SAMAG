Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their usability and accessibility for older adults remain understudied. This paper presents an empirical investigation into the speech recognition accuracy and error recovery strategies of three popular voice assistants for older adults. Our user study involving 30 participants aged 65-85 reveals significant variations in speech recognition performance across devices, with a mean accuracy of 82.5%. We identify key factors contributing to errors, including speech rate, vocabulary, and cognitive load. Furthermore, we develop and evaluate a novel error recovery interface that leverages multimodal feedback and incremental confirmation, resulting in improved user satisfaction and task completion rates.
