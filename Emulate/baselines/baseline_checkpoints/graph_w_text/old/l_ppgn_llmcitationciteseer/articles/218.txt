Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a complex problem. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and manual tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to query optimization in distributed database systems. We propose a novel framework, 'RL-Optimizer', which leverages a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan from a large search space. Our experiments demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
