Real-time data warehousing has become crucial for businesses to make timely decisions. However, existing solutions struggle to provide efficient transactional support, leading to performance bottlenecks. This paper presents 'RTDW-Tx', a novel architecture that integrates a main-memory database with a disk-based store. We propose a hybrid concurrency control mechanism that leverages both optimistic and pessimistic approaches to minimize conflicts and aborts. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that RTDW-Tx achieves up to 3x improvement in transactional throughput and 2x reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art solutions.
