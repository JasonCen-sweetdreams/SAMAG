Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'EmbedEx', which leverages neural embeddings to enrich query representations. By learning dense vector representations of query terms and documents, EmbedEx can capture semantic relationships and contextual dependencies that traditional lexical matching methods overlook. Our experiments on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that EmbedEx achieves significant improvements in mean average precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
