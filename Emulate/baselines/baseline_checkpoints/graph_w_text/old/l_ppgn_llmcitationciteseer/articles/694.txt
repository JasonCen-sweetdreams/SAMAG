The rapid growth of digital data has necessitated the development of more efficient and accurate information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel document ranking framework based on hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs). Unlike traditional ranking models that rely on hand-crafted features, our approach leverages the structural properties of document graphs to capture complex semantic relationships. Experimental results on several large-scale datasets demonstrate that our HGNN-based ranking model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and computational efficiency.
