Distributed database systems face significant performance challenges due to the complexity of query optimization. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in real-time. Our system, 'QOptRL', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database's current state and workload. We evaluate QOptRL on a real-world database benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and resource utilization compared to traditional query optimizers. Our approach is particularly effective in handling ad-hoc queries and dynamic workloads, making it suitable for modern distributed database systems.
