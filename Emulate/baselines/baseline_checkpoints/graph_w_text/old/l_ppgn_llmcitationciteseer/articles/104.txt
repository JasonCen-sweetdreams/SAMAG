Autonomous vehicle fleets require efficient coordination to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance safety. This paper presents a novel multi-agent system, 'AVENUE', designed to scale to large fleets. AVENUE combines decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with a hierarchical communication framework, enabling real-time decision-making and information exchange among vehicles. We evaluate AVENUE in a simulated urban environment, demonstrating improved response times, reduced traffic congestion, and increased fleet efficiency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
