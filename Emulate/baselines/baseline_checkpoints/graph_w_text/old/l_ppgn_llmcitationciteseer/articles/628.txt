Query optimization is a crucial component of relational database management systems, especially in distributed settings. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workload patterns and data distributions. Our method, called 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy from a large space of possible plans. We evaluate RL-Opt on a benchmark dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques. Our results show that RL-Opt is effective in handling complex queries and dynamic workloads, making it a promising solution for modern distributed database systems.
