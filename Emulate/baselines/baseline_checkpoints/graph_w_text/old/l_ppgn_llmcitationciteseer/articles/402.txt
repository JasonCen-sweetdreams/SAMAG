Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for multiple tenants sharing the same database. We design a reward function that captures query performance, resource utilization, and fairness among tenants. Our experiments on a real-world benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average improvement of 30% in query response time and 25% in resource utilization.
