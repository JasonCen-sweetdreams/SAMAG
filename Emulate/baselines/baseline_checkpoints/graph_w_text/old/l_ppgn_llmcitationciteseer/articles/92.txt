Voice assistants have the potential to enhance the daily lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but their current designs often fall short. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an accessible voice assistant tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing with 30 older adults with cognitive impairments. Our results highlight the importance of simplifying language, providing visual feedback, and incorporating cognitive support features. We propose a set of design guidelines and demonstrate their feasibility through a prototype implementation.
