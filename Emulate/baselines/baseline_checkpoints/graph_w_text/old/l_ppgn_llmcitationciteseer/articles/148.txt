Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using multi-armed bandits (MABs), which leverages online learning to adapt to changing workload patterns. Our MAB-based optimizer, 'AdaptOpt', dynamically adjusts query execution plans based on feedback from past executions, reducing the need for manual tuning and expertise. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that AdaptOpt achieves up to 30% improvement in query response times compared to state-of-the-art static optimizers.
