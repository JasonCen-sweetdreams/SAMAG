Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts performance and resource utilization. Traditional query optimizers rely on rule-based or cost-based approaches, which often struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads and complex query patterns. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-Opt', that leverages reinforcement learning to learn optimal query plans. We design a Markov decision process to model the query optimization problem and employ a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
