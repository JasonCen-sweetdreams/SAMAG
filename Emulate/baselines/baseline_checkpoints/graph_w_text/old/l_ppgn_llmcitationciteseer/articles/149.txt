This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on its local observations and communication with neighboring agents. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model the agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn the task allocation policy. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain show that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
