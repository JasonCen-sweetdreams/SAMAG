Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in enhancing learning outcomes, but user engagement remains a crucial factor in its adoption. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR learning environments. We designed a VR platform that allows users to create customized avatars and compared their engagement levels with those using standardized avatars. Results from a user study involving 120 participants show that personalized avatars lead to increased user satisfaction, reduced cognitive load, and improved knowledge retention. We discuss the implications of our findings on the design of VR-based educational systems.
