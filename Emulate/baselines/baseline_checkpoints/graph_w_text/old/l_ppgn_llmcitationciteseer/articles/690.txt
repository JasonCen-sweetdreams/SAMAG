Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this demographic. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and clinicians to identify key design principles and guidelines. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, familiarity, and support for cognitive and motor abilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study of a VR-based reminiscence therapy system.
