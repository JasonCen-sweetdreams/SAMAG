In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a fundamental problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks among agents in a distributed manner. We design a novel GNN architecture, 'AgentGNN', that incorporates agent-specific features and communication graphs to learn effective task assignments. Experimental results on various benchmark scenarios demonstrate that AgentGNN outperforms traditional optimization-based methods and achieves near-optimal solutions in highly dynamic environments.
