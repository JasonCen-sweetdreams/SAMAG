Recommendation systems face scalability challenges as user-item interactions grow exponentially. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that efficiently captures complex relationships between users and items. By hierarchically aggregating graph attention weights, HGAT reduces computational complexity while preserving recommendation accuracy. We evaluate HGAT on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art graph-based recommenders. Our approach enables real-time recommendations for massive-scale e-commerce platforms.
