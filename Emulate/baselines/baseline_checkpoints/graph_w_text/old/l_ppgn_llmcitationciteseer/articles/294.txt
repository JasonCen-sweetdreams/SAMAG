This paper addresses the problem of coordinating heterogeneous multi-agent systems in partially observable environments. We propose a decentralized framework based on partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), which enables individual agents to make decisions while taking into account the uncertainty of other agents' states and actions. We introduce a novel algorithm, 'Dec-POMDP-Coord', which leverages a distributed constraint optimization approach to compute approximate solutions to the coordination problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of scenarios, including robotic search and rescue, and smart traffic management.
