Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, aiming to improve the retrieval performance by reformulating the original query. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and may not capture the complex relationships between query terms. This paper presents a novel deep neural network-based approach, RelevanceNet, that leverages relevance feedback to learn effective query expansion strategies. RelevanceNet consists of a hierarchical attention mechanism and a semantic embedding layer, which jointly capture the semantic relationships between query terms and their relevance to the user's information need. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RelevanceNet outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of mean average precision and nDCG.
