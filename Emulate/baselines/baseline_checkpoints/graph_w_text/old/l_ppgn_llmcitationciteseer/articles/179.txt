Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, 'EasyVox', tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing with 30 older adults, revealing key challenges and preferences. EasyVox incorporates personalized voice prompts, simplified dialogue flows, and error tolerance, resulting in a 35% reduction in task completion time and a 25% increase in user satisfaction compared to existing commercial systems.
