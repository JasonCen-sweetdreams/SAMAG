Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but the impact of personalization on user experience in VR interfaces remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the effects of personalized recommendations, avatar customization, and adaptive difficulty adjustment on user engagement, satisfaction, and cognitive load in a VR-based educational game. Our results show that personalized features can significantly enhance user experience, but may also lead to increased cognitive load and decreased sense of agency. We discuss implications for VR interface design and provide guidelines for balancing personalization with user autonomy.
