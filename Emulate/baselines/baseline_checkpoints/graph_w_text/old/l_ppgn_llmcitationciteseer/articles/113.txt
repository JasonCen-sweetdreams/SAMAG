In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to agents in a distributed manner. Our method, called GraphTask, learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a graph and uses GNNs to predict task-agent affinity scores. We show that GraphTask outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and agent utilization, while also being more robust to agent failures and communication delays. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse robotics scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
