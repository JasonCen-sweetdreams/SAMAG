This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a social VR scenario. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance user engagement, emotional presence, and overall satisfaction. We also found that users with personalized avatars reported higher levels of self-identification and empathy towards their virtual representation. The findings have implications for the design of VR systems, suggesting that personalized avatars can improve user experience and facilitate more effective human-computer interaction.
