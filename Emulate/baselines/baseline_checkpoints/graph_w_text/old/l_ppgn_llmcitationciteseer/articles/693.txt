In distributed systems, efficient resource allocation relies on effective communication among agents. This paper presents a novel adaptive communication protocol, 'ACORN', that enables agents to dynamically adjust their message exchange strategies based on the system's changing resource availability. We introduce a probabilistic model that captures the uncertainty of resource demand and supply, and develop a distributed learning algorithm that allows agents to learn the optimal communication policies. Experimental results on a simulated grid computing environment demonstrate that ACORN outperforms existing protocols in terms of resource allocation efficiency and system responsiveness.
