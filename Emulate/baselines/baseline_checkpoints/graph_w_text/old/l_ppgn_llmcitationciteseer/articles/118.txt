Distributed search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from a vast, geographically dispersed corpus. This paper proposes a novel proximity-aware query expansion technique, 'PAQE', which leverages spatial proximity to improve document ranking and reduce network latency. By incorporating document proximity into the query expansion process, PAQE reduces the number of unnecessary document retrievals, resulting in significant performance gains. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that PAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and query response time.
