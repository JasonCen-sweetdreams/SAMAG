Column-oriented NoSQL databases are increasingly popular for storing and querying high-dimensional data. However, existing indexing techniques are often insufficient for handling the complex queries and large datasets common in these systems. This paper introduces 'HyperCube', a novel indexing approach that leverages the column-oriented storage layout to efficiently index high-dimensional data. HyperCube uses a hybrid indexing strategy that combines a grid-based indexing scheme with a compact bit-vector representation, enabling fast query processing and efficient storage utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperCube outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query performance and storage efficiency.
