As virtual reality (VR) technology advances, there is a growing need for more efficient and natural interaction methods. This paper explores the potential of gaze-based interaction for VR, focusing on foveated rendering and eye movement prediction. We propose a novel approach that integrates machine learning-based eye tracking with foveated rendering to reduce computational overhead while maintaining visual quality. Our user study demonstrates significant improvements in interaction accuracy and user experience compared to traditional controller-based input methods. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of gaze-based interaction on eye movement patterns and discuss implications for future VR system design.
