Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data processing. However, optimizing queries in DDS remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Our approach is able to adapt to changing database workloads and optimize queries more efficiently than traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach reduces query execution time by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
