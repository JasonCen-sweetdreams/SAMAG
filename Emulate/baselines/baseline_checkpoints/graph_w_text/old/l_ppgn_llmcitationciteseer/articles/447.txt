Virtual reality (VR) avatars play a crucial role in facilitating social interactions in immersive environments. However, existing avatar design approaches often neglect the importance of embodiment, leading to reduced social presence and user engagement. This paper presents an embodiment-driven design framework for VR avatars, which integrates insights from psychology, sociology, and HCI. Our framework incorporates three key components: 1) anthropomorphic avatar design, 2) nonverbal behavior modeling, and 3) real-time affective feedback. We evaluate our approach through a user study, demonstrating significant improvements in social presence, emotional connection, and overall user experience. The findings have implications for the design of VR-based social interactions, remote collaboration, and virtual events.
