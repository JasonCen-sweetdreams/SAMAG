Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods often rely on simplistic user-item interaction models. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that incorporates both user and item embeddings, as well as their complex relationships, to generate personalized recommendations. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant user and item features, enabling interpretable explanations for the recommended items. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models.
