This paper proposes a novel decentralized multi-agent coordination framework that leverages graph attention networks to efficiently allocate tasks and resources among agents. Our approach, called Dec-GAT, utilizes local observations and communication with neighboring agents to learn a hierarchical representation of the graph structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Dec-GAT in a variety of simulated environments, including autonomous vehicle coordination and smart grid management. Experimental results show that Dec-GAT outperforms traditional decentralized approaches in terms of convergence speed and task allocation efficiency.
