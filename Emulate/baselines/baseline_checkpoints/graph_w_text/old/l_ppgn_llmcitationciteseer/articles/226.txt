Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and provide high availability. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a challenging task due to the complexity of query execution plans and distributed resource allocation. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query performance in DDS. We design an RL agent that learns to select optimal query execution plans and resource allocation strategies based on feedback from the database system. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques and achieves significant improvements in query response time and throughput.
