Few-shot image classification involves learning to recognize novel classes from limited labeled examples. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a new meta-learning framework that leverages graph neural networks to model relationships between classes and instances. HGAT uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant classes and instances during inference, achieving state-of-the-art performance on popular few-shot benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in adapting to new classes with limited labeled data.
