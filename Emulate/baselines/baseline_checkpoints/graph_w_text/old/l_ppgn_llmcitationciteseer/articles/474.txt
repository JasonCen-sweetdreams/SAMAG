Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the underlying causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that integrates feature-level and temporal attention mechanisms to identify and explain anomalies in time-series data. Our approach achieves improved detection accuracy and provides visual explanations of the anomaly detection process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies and attributing them to relevant features and timestamps.
