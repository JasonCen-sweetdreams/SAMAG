Distributed database systems require efficient query optimization to minimize response time and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, 'RL-QOpt', learns to adapt to changing workloads and data distributions by exploring the query optimization space using a reward function that balances response time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of response time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
