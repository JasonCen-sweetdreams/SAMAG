In complex systems, resource allocation is a challenging problem that requires coordinating autonomous agents to achieve efficient outcomes. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to train agents to optimize resource allocation in decentralized environments. We develop a multi-agent framework that incorporates graph neural networks to model agent interactions and learn effective policies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization methods and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms in various resource allocation scenarios, showcasing its potential in real-world applications such as smart grids and traffic management.
