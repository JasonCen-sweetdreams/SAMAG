Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that not only detects anomalies but also provides explanations for the detected outliers. HAN learns to focus on relevant segments and features in the time-series data using a hierarchical attention mechanism. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting anomalies and providing interpretable explanations. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and F1-score.
