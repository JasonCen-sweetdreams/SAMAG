Distributed database systems have become ubiquitous in modern data-driven applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design an RL agent that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database system. Our approach leverages techniques from deep reinforcement learning to efficiently explore the vast space of possible query plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
