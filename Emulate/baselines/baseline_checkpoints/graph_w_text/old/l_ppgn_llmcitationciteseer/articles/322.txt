Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of personalized experiences. This paper presents a novel gaze-based adaptive user modeling approach that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to infer user preferences and adapt the VR environment accordingly. Our system utilizes a deep learning-based gaze estimation model and integrates it with a probabilistic user modeling framework to dynamically adjust the VR content, leading to enhanced user engagement and satisfaction. We evaluate our approach through a user study, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the overall VR experience.
