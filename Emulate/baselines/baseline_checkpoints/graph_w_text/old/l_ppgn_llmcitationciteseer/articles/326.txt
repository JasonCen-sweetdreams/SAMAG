Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) to improve the retrieval performance. However, traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and may not effectively capture the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. This paper proposes a novel neural attention-based query expansion approach, which leverages the strengths of deep learning to model the contextual dependencies between query terms and documents. Our approach uses a neural attention mechanism to selectively emphasize relevant query terms and expands the query through a iterative refinement process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
