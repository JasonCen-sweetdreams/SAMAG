We propose a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HierARL', for autonomous anomaly detection in time-series data. HierARL combines the strengths of hierarchical temporal representations and reinforcement learning to identify rare events and adapt to changing patterns. Our approach consists of a hierarchical encoder that extracts features at multiple scales, a reinforcement learning module that optimizes the anomaly detection policy, and a novel reward function that balances detection accuracy and false alarm rate. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HierARL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to concept drift.
