Specialized search engines cater to specific domains, but their retrieval efficiency is often hindered by the complexity of domain-specific queries. This paper presents a hierarchical query expansion framework, HQE-SSE, which leverages domain knowledge graphs to identify relevant concepts and expand user queries. Our approach employs a novel graph-based ranking model to prioritize expansion terms, resulting in improved retrieval precision and reduced latency. Experimental evaluation on a biomedical search engine demonstrates that HQE-SSE outperforms state-of-the-art expansion techniques, achieving a 25% increase in average precision at top-10 results.
