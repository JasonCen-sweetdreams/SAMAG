Cooperative task allocation is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to learn cooperative policies for task allocation. We introduce a decentralized framework, 'CoopTA', which utilizes a shared attention mechanism to facilitate communication among agents. Experiments on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that CoopTA outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to dynamic environments.
