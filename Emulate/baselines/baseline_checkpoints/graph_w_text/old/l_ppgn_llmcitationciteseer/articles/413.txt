This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible gesture-based interfaces tailored to older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with 15 older adults, resulting in a set of design recommendations for reducing error rates and improving user experience. Our proposed interface, 'Easy Gesture', incorporates machine learning-based gesture recognition and personalized feedback mechanisms to accommodate varying levels of motor ability. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to existing gesture-based interfaces.
