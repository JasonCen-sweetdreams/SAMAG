Intelligent traffic signal control systems can significantly reduce congestion and emissions in urban areas. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'Graph-MARL', which leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex traffic flow dynamics. By incorporating real-time traffic data and adaptive graph updates, Graph-MARL outperforms traditional Q-learning and deep Q-network approaches in a simulated urban traffic network. Our results demonstrate improved traffic flow efficiency, reduced congestion, and enhanced adaptability to changing traffic conditions.
