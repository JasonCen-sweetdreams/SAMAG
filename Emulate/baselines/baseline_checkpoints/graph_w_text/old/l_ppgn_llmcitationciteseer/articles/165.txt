Multi-agent systems (MAS) often operate in dynamic environments where agents must negotiate to achieve their goals. This paper proposes a novel hybrid negotiation strategy that integrates machine learning and game-theoretic approaches to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Our approach, called 'HybNeg', combines reinforcement learning with Bayesian Nash equilibria to optimize agent utilities while considering the uncertainty of opponent agents' actions. Experimental results in a simulated smart grid scenario show that HybNeg outperforms traditional negotiation strategies in terms of convergence speed and overall system efficiency.
