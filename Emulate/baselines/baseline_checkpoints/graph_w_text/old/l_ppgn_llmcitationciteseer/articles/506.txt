In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents in a way that maximizes overall efficiency. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task representations and allocate tasks to agents. Our approach, called 'GraphTask', models the agent-task graph as a heterogeneous graph and uses a GNN to learn node and edge representations. These representations are then used to compute task allocations that minimize communication overhead and maximize task completion rates. We evaluate GraphTask on a series of simulated scenarios and demonstrate significant improvements over existing decentralized task allocation methods.
