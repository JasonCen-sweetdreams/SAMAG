Large-scale knowledge graphs pose significant challenges for information retrieval tasks due to their vast size and complexity. This paper proposes a novel approach to document embeddings, Hierarchical Document Embeddings (HDE), which leverages the graph structure to learn dense vector representations of documents. By exploiting the hierarchical relationships between entities, HDE enables efficient querying and retrieval of relevant documents. Experimental results on a large-scale knowledge graph dataset demonstrate that HDE outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency.
