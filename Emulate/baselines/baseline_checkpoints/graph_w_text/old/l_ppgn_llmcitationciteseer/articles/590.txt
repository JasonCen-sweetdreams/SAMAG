Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a given question. While significant progress has been made in ODQA, passage retrieval remains a major bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HierRank', which leverages both local and global contextualized representations to improve passage retrieval efficiency. HierRank consists of a coarse-grained retriever that selects top-k passages using a lightweight neural network, followed by a fine-grained ranker that re-ranks the top-k passages using a more expressive, but computationally expensive, neural network. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HierRank achieves state-of-the-art passage retrieval performance while reducing computational cost by 30% compared to existing methods.
