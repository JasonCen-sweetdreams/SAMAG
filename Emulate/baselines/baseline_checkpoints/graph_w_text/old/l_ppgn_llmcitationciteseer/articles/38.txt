Traditional document ranking models in information retrieval rely on hand-crafted features and ignore the rich structural relationships between documents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) framework for document ranking, which learns to represent documents as nodes in a graph and captures their semantic relationships. Our HGNN model consists of a document encoder, a graph encoder, and a ranking module. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of ranking accuracy and efficiency.
