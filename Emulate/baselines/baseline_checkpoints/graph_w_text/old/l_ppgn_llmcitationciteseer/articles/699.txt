Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, but state-of-the-art models often come at the cost of high computational complexity. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural architecture search (HNAS) method to discover efficient object detectors. We introduce a multi-level search space that combines macro- and micro-search to optimize both the backbone network and the detection head. Experimental results on COCO and VOC datasets demonstrate that our searched models achieve comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art detectors while reducing computational complexity by up to 3.5x.
