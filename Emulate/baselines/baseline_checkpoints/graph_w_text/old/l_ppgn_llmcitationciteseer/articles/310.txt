Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education by providing immersive and interactive learning experiences. This study investigates the role of embodied cognition in VR-based learning environments, where learners engage with virtual objects using their bodies. We conducted a user study with 60 participants, who completed a series of tasks in a VR environment that either supported or hindered embodied cognition. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly improves learning outcomes, reduces cognitive load, and enhances user engagement. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR-based learning systems and highlight future research directions.
