Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing methods rely on simplistic feature interactions or lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages the strengths of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to provide personalized and interpretable recommendations. HGAT captures complex item relationships through hierarchical graph encoding and adaptively focuses on relevant item features using multi-layer attention. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and providing meaningful explanations.
