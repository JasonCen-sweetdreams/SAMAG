Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph-based tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a major concern. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical contrastive learning framework to enhance the robustness of GNNs against graph perturbations. By jointly optimizing node-level and graph-level contrastive losses, our approach effectively captures the structural and semantic properties of graphs. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves the adversarial robustness of GNNs while maintaining their performance on clean graphs.
