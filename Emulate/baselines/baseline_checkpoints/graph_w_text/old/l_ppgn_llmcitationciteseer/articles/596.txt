Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but our understanding of embodied cognition in VR environments remains limited. This paper investigates the role of gesture-based interaction in enhancing cognitive processing and user experience in VR. We designed an immersive VR experiment where participants performed gestures to solve spatial problems, and analyzed their brain activity, gesture patterns, and subjective reports. Our results show that gesture-based interaction increases cognitive load, but also improves problem-solving performance and user satisfaction. We discuss implications for VR interface design and embodied cognition theory.
