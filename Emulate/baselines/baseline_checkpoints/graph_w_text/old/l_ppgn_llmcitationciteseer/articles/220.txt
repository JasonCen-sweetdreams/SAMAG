As AI models become increasingly pervasive in natural language processing (NLP) applications, there is a growing need for transparent and explainable decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to provide insights into the model's reasoning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN on a range of NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis and question answering, and show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of both accuracy and interpretability.
