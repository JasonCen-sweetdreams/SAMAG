Entity disambiguation in knowledge graphs is a challenging task due to the presence of homonymous entities. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph attention networks (GATs) to disambiguate entities in large-scale knowledge graphs. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both local and global context information, enabling the model to distinguish between entities with similar names but different semantic meanings. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and F1-score, demonstrating the effectiveness of GATs in entity disambiguation tasks.
