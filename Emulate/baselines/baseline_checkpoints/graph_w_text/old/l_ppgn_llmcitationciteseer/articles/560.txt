Voice assistants have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but their adoption among older adults is hindered by limitations in speech recognition, dialogue management, and accessibility. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction framework, 'ElderVoice', which integrates speech, gesture, and gaze inputs to facilitate more intuitive and accessible interactions. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants. Our framework provides a foundation for inclusive voice assistant design, enabling older adults to fully benefit from AI-driven technologies.
