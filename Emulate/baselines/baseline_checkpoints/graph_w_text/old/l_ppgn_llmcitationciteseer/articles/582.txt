Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in DDS due to the complexity of data distribution and network topology. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the DDS as a graph, where nodes represent data partitions and edges represent communication links. Our GNN-based optimizer learns to predict the optimal execution plan for a given query by capturing the structural and relational features of the graph. Experimental results on a real-world DDS dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
