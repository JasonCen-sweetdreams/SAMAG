Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but designing these systems to foster user trust remains an open challenge. This paper explores the effect of anthropomorphic design elements, such as facial expressions, tone of voice, and language patterns, on user trust in conversational AI. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants, using a simulated conversational interface with varying levels of anthropomorphism. Our results show that moderate levels of anthropomorphism can increase user trust, but over-anthropomorphization can lead to a decline in trust and perceived system credibility. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of trustworthy conversational interfaces.
