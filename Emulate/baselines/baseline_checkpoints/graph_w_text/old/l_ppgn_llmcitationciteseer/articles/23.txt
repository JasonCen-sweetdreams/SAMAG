Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database system. Our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of execution time and resource utilization. We evaluate our method on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance.
