Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', learns to select the optimal query plan by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance compared to traditional optimization techniques.
