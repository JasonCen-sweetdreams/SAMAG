Autonomous agents in complex environments require efficient task allocation to achieve goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'RL-ATA', that utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize agent assignments. We model the environment as a Markov decision process and employ a multi-agent Q-learning approach to learn optimal task allocation policies. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that RL-ATA outperforms traditional allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
