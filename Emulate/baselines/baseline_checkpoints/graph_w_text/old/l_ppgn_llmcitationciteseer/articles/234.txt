In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. Our approach represents the agent-agent and agent-task interactions as a graph, and uses GNNs to learn a distributed task allocation policy. We evaluate our approach on a variety of benchmark scenarios, demonstrating improved performance and scalability compared to traditional centralized and decentralized methods. Our framework is applicable to various domains, including robotics, smart cities, and IoT systems.
