Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture document semantics, leading to suboptimal ranking performance. This paper proposes a novel document representation model, HierAttnDoc, which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant sentence and word contexts. Our approach incorporates a sentence-level attention module to weigh the importance of individual sentences, followed by a word-level attention module to refine the representation. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain over state-of-the-art baselines.
