Neural search engines have shown promise in improving retrieval performance, but often rely on simple query representations that fail to capture nuanced search intent. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach that leverages attention-based term embeddings to selectively incorporate relevant terms from the query context. Our method, termed Attentive Expansion, adaptively weights term importance based on their contextual relevance, leading to more effective query representations. Experimental results on the TREC Deep Learning Track demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
