As document collections continue to grow, traditional query expansion techniques struggle to maintain efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE', which leverages a multi-level indexing strategy to prune irrelevant terms and prioritize informative expansions. We introduce a probabilistic term weighting scheme that adaptively adjusts to the retrieval context, leading to significant improvements in precision and recall. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HQE in reducing query latency while achieving state-of-the-art retrieval performance.
