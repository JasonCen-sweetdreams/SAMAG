Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, where interpretability is crucial for real-world applications. We propose HiGAT, a hierarchical graph attention network that incorporates multi-scale node representations and attention mechanisms to capture complex patterns. HiGAT learns to attend to relevant node neighborhoods, providing interpretable insights into the classification process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate HiGAT's state-of-the-art performance and improved interpretability over existing graph neural networks.
