Emotion recognition in conversational agents is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the multimodal nature of human communication. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that integrates visual, acoustic, and linguistic features to recognize emotions in conversations. Our HAN model consists of three levels of attention: feature-level, modality-level, and conversation-level attention. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions in conversations, achieving an average F1-score of 84.2%.
