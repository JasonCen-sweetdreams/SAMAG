Temporal graph databases have become increasingly important for modeling complex relationships in dynamic networks. However, querying these databases can be computationally expensive due to the massive scale of data. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, Hierarchical Bitap Index (HBI), which leverages the hierarchical structure of temporal graphs to accelerate query processing. Our approach exploits the bitwise operations to efficiently filter out irrelevant graph patterns, reducing the search space and improving query performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HBI outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query latency and storage efficiency.
