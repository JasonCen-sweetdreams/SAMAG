With the increasing scale of modern information retrieval systems, query optimization has become a critical bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel distributed query optimization framework, 'DistroOpt', which leverages parallel processing and machine learning-based cost estimation to minimize response times. We introduce a hierarchical query decomposition strategy that selectively applies optimization techniques to individual query components, resulting in significant performance gains. Experimental evaluation on a large-scale distributed IR system demonstrates that DistroOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization methods by up to 30% in terms of query latency.
