The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors has led to an explosion of time-series data, posing significant challenges for efficient querying and indexing. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'TS-Adapt', which leverages a combination of bitap and tree-based indexing to achieve high query performance and adapt to changing data distributions. Our approach incorporates a scalable and incremental indexing mechanism that can handle high-volume inserts and updates, while minimizing memory footprint. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TS-Adapt outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of storage efficiency.
