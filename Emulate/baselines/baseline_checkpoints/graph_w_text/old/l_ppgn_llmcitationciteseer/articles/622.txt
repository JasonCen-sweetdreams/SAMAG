Time-series data is increasingly prevalent in various domains, leading to a growing need for efficient join operations in distributed database systems. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'TSJ-Tree', which enables fast and scalable time-series joins. TSJ-Tree leverages a combination of spatial and temporal indexing to prune the search space, reducing the number of unnecessary join operations. Our experimental evaluation on real-world sensor datasets demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing indexing methods, achieving up to 5x speedup in join execution time.
