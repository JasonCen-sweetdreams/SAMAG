Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on effective passage retrieval to provide accurate answers. This paper introduces a novel approach, Adaptive Dense Passage Retrieval (ADPR), which leverages a dense passage encoder and a question-aware adapter to dynamically generate relevant passages. ADPR adapts to the question context by learning a question-dependent attention mechanism, enabling the model to focus on the most informative passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that ADPR outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods, achieving a 5.2% absolute improvement in top-1 accuracy.
