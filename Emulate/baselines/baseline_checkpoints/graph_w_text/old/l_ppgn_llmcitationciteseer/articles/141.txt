Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel neural re-ranking approach, 'NeuQE', which leverages query expansion to refine search queries. Our method utilizes a transformer-based architecture to learn context-aware query representations and generates expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
