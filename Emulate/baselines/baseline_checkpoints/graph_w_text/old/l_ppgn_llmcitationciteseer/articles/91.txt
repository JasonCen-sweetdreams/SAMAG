Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the quality of retrieved documents. However, existing methods often rely on handcrafted rules or statistical models, which may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HREQ', which leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select expansion terms based on the query context. We demonstrate that HREQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving higher precision and recall while reducing computational overhead.
