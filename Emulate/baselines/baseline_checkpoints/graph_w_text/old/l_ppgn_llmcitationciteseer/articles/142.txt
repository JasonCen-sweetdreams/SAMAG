Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data analysis, but it becomes increasingly challenging as graph sizes grow. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical graph representations to improve scalability and accuracy. HGAT adaptively selects relevant subgraphs and attention weights, enabling efficient feature aggregation and node classification. We evaluate HGAT on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over existing state-of-the-art methods, especially on large graphs.
