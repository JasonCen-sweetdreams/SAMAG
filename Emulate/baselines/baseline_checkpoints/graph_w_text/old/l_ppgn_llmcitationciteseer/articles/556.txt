Conversational search systems aim to provide more natural and interactive search experiences. However, their effectiveness is often hindered by the lack of explicit query formulation. This paper proposes a deep hierarchical query expansion (DHQE) approach, which leverages a novel neural architecture to iteratively refine and expand initial search queries. Our DHQE model combines a hierarchical attention mechanism with a generative query expansion component, allowing it to adapt to the nuances of conversational queries. Experimental results on a large conversational search dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search relevance and user satisfaction metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
