Multi-tenant Database-as-a-Service (DaaS) platforms have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance in such environments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MTQO', which leverages machine learning models to predict query execution times and dynamically adjusts resource allocation. We introduce a hierarchical clustering approach to group tenants with similar workload patterns, enabling more effective sharing of resources and improved query throughput. Experimental results on a real-world DaaS platform demonstrate that MTQO reduces average query latency by up to 35% compared to traditional optimization techniques.
