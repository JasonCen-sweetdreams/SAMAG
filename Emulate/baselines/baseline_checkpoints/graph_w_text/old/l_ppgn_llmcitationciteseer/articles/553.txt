In multi-agent systems, decision-making often involves complex interactions and dependencies between agents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in such systems. Our approach learns to identify influential agents and their interactions, while also capturing hierarchical relationships between agents. Experiments on a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate that our HAN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of decision quality and interpretability. We also provide visualizations of attention weights, offering insights into the decision-making process.
