Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, but traditional methods often struggle to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn robust query representations. Our proposed model, 'NeuroExpander', combines a transformer-based encoder with a graph attention mechanism to generate expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
