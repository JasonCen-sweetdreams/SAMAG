Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents an inclusive VR interface design that incorporates multimodal feedback and adaptive navigation mechanisms to enable visually impaired users to effectively interact with virtual environments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and observed significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our findings provide valuable insights for designing accessible VR systems that can benefit a broader user population.
