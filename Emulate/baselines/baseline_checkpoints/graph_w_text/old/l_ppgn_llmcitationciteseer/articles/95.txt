Emotion recognition is a crucial task in human-computer interaction, but existing methods often struggle with multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision). We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features for emotion inference. Our HAN model consists of a feature-level attention mechanism that weights modality-specific features, followed by a decision-level attention mechanism that fuses the outputs from each modality. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal inputs, especially in cases where individual modalities are ambiguous or corrupted.
