As column stores become increasingly popular for big data analytics, efficient indexing techniques are crucial for optimizing query performance. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing approach, 'RANGEIX', specifically designed for range queries on distributed column stores. RANGEIX leverages a combination of adaptive sampling and zone mapping to reduce the number of disk accesses and enable parallel query processing. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RANGEIX outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of storage efficiency.
