Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to improve healthcare experiences for diverse patient populations. However, existing ECAs often lack cultural sensitivity, linguistic adaptability, and emotional intelligence. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive ECAs that incorporate anthropomorphic features, multimodal communication, and empathy-driven dialogue management. We conducted a user study with 120 participants from diverse backgrounds, demonstrating that our proposed ECA design improves patient engagement, trust, and satisfaction in healthcare consultations. Our findings have implications for the development of culturally responsive healthcare technologies.
