Voice assistants have the potential to improve the daily lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but their current designs often exacerbate existing accessibility barriers. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants, focusing on the needs of individuals with mild cognitive impairment. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant interface that incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified language prompts, visual cues, and error correction mechanisms. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
