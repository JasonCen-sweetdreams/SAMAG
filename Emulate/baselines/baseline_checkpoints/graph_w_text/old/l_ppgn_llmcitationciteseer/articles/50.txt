Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query representations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. By incorporating a self-attention mechanism, DeepQE adaptively weights term importance and discovers latent concepts, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Our experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly for verbose and ambiguous queries.
