Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it significantly impacts the retrieval performance. However, the existing methods often rely on handcrafted rules or supervised learning, which may not generalize well to diverse query distributions. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework for query expansion, which learns to select the most informative terms to expand the query. Our RL agent is trained using a reward function that maximizes the expected reciprocal rank, and we employ a neural network to approximate the Q-function. Experimental results on the TREC datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
