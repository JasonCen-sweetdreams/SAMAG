Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing, but query optimization remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a reinforcement learning agent that learns to optimize query plans based on a reward function that balances execution time and resource utilization. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
