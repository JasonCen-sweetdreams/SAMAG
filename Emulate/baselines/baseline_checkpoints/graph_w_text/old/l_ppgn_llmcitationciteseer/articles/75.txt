Query optimization is a critical component of database management systems. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics, rule-based systems, or exhaustive search, which can be inefficient and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RL-QO', that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. By formulating query optimization as a Markov decision process, RL-QO learns to adapt to changing data distributions, workload patterns, and system configurations. Our experiments on a large-scale distributed database show that RL-QO outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
