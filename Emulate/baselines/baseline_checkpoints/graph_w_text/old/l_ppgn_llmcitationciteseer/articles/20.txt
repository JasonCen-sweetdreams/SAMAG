Query expansion techniques are crucial for effective document retrieval, but existing methods often struggle with domain heterogeneity. This paper presents a hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HIEREXP', which leverages semantic relationships between words to adaptively expand queries. Our approach integrates a domain-aware term weighting scheme with a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify relevant expansion terms. Experiments on four diverse search domains (medicine, law, computer science, and social science) demonstrate that HIEREXP outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of both precision and recall.
