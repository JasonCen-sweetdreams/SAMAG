In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks to model complex agent interactions. Our approach, called 'GNN-TA', utilizes graph attention mechanisms to learn agent representations and predict task assignments. We evaluate GNN-TA on a variety of benchmark scenarios and demonstrate improved task allocation efficiency compared to traditional centralized approaches. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence and robustness of our method.
