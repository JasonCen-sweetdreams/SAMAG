As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly ubiquitous, securing user authentication on these devices is crucial. This paper proposes a novel gaze-based authentication system that leverages deep learning techniques to recognize users based on their gaze patterns. We introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that processes eye-tracking data from AR devices, achieving high authentication accuracy and robustness against various attacks. Our approach outperforms traditional password-based methods and demonstrates a promising solution for secure AR interaction.
