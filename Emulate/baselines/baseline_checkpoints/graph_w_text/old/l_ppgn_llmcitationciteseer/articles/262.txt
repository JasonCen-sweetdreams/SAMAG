Real-time data warehousing poses significant query optimization challenges due to the need for rapid data ingestion and analysis. This paper introduces 'DeepQOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to efficiently optimize query plans for real-time data warehousing workloads. We propose a custom deep Q-network architecture that learns to navigate the query optimization search space, leveraging query features and workload characteristics to guide the optimization process. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that DeepQOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
