Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it significantly impacts the system's performance and scalability. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which often fail to adapt to complex queries and dynamic workloads. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning techniques to predict optimal query plans. Our approach, called 'ML-QOpt', uses a combination of graph neural networks and reinforcement learning to learn from historical query patterns and optimize query plans for improved performance and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ML-QOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
