Multi-agent planning is a crucial aspect of artificial intelligence, but existing approaches often lack interpretability. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture that facilitates explainable planning in complex multi-agent systems. Our model leverages graph attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their relationships, while hierarchical abstraction enables efficient planning at multiple scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN on several benchmark domains, showcasing improved planning performance and enhanced explainability through visualizable attention patterns.
