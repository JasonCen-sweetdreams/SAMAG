Few-shot natural language processing (NLP) remains a significant challenge, as models often struggle to generalize to new tasks with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach, Hierarchical Task Embeddings (HTE), which learns to adapt to new NLP tasks by leveraging hierarchical relationships between tasks. Our method consists of two components: a task encoder that maps tasks to a hierarchical embedding space, and a meta-learner that adapts to new tasks by traversing this space. Experimental results on several few-shot NLP benchmarks demonstrate that HTE outperforms existing meta-learning approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as text classification and named entity recognition.
