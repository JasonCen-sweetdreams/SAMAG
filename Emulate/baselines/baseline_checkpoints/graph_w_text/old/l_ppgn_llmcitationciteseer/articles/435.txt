Multi-label classification tasks often involve complex label dependencies, which existing models struggle to capture. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that models label relationships through a hierarchical graph structure. The HAN framework consists of two components: a label-aware attention module that identifies relevant labels and a dependency-aware graph neural network that captures higher-order label relationships. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in both classification performance and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
