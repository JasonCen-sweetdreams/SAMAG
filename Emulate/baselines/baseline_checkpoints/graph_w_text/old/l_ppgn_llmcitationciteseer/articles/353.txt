Conversational search systems aim to retrieve relevant documents based on user queries. However, the ambiguity and brevity of natural language queries often lead to poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'NeuroXpand', which leverages deep neural networks to generate high-quality expansion terms. We introduce a dual-encoder architecture that captures both semantic and syntactic relationships between query terms and documents. Experimental results on the TREC Conversational Assistance Track dataset demonstrate that NeuroXpand outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
