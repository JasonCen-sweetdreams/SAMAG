Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but their performance can be limited by the quality of the input query. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our approach uses a neural ranker to select relevant documents and then applies a term-weighting scheme to extract expansion terms. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to existing query expansion techniques.
