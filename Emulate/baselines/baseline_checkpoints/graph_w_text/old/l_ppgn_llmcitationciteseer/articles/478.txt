Virtual reality (VR) systems have the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an inclusive VR platform, 'CAREVR', tailored to the cognitive and sensory abilities of older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Our user-centered approach incorporates simplified interfaces, audio-based cues, and personalized feedback mechanisms to facilitate engagement and enjoyment. A mixed-methods study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in user experience and cognitive stimulation compared to traditional VR systems.
