Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their adoption among older adults is hindered by difficulties in understanding and interacting with these systems. This study explores the design of inclusive voice assistants that accommodate the unique needs and abilities of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study, involving 30 participants aged 65+, to investigate the effects of multimodal interaction (speech, gesture, and text) on user experience and task completion. Our results show that a multimodal interface significantly improves task success rates and user satisfaction, particularly for individuals with hearing or speech impairments. We provide design recommendations for creating more accessible and usable voice assistants for older adults.
