Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, but existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules or labor-intensive domain-specific knowledge. This paper introduces NeuralQEx, a novel query expansion framework that leverages neural semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and relevant documents. We demonstrate that NeuralQEx outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of precision and recall, while reducing computational overhead by up to 30%. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to out-of-vocabulary queries and can be easily integrated into existing retrieval systems.
