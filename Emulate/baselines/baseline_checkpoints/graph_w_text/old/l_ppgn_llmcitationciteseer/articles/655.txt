Distributed database systems are increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a customized deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to optimize query execution plans based on runtime feedback. Our experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
