The proliferation of Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms has led to a surge in multi-tenancy, where multiple clients share the same database infrastructure. However, query optimization in such environments is challenging due to varying workload patterns and resource constraints. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MTQO', which leverages machine learning and graph-based techniques to efficiently optimize queries in multi-tenant DBaaS platforms. Our approach involves modeling tenant behavior, predicting query performance, and dynamically allocating resources to minimize latency and improve throughput. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization.
