User frustration is a pervasive issue in human-computer interaction, often resulting in diminished productivity and user experience. This paper investigates the role of emotion-adaptive interfaces in mitigating user frustration. We designed and implemented an adaptive system that utilizes multimodal affect recognition to detect user emotions and adjust the interface accordingly. Our user study involving 30 participants shows that the emotion-adaptive interface significantly reduces user frustration and anxiety, especially during periods of high cognitive load. The results provide valuable insights into the potential of affective computing in HCI and have implications for the design of more empathetic and user-centered interfaces.
