Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it allows users to refine their search queries and improve result relevance. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, 'DeepQExp', which learns to select optimal expansion terms from a large vocabulary. Our method utilizes a hierarchical policy network to balance exploration and exploitation, and incorporates a reward function that accounts for both query similarity and document relevance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQExp outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
