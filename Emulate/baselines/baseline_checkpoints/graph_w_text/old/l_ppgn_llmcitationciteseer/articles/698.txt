Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and behavior in VR environments. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, who interacted with a VR system using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, reduced cognitive load, and improved overall satisfaction. We also identify key design factors that influence avatar customization and provide guidelines for VR system designers.
