E-commerce search engines often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages user behavior and product metadata to disambiguate queries and improve search relevance. CAQE incorporates a graph-based representation of user-product interactions and a neural ranking model to re-weight query terms based on contextual cues. Experiments on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision and a 17% increase in user engagement.
