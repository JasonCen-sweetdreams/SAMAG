Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture user intent, often relying on simplistic term-weighting schemes. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, dubbed 'NeuroQE'. By modeling the semantic relationships between query terms and document contents, NeuroQE generates high-quality expansion terms that improve retrieval performance. Our experiments on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate significant gains in precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, showcasing the potential of deep learning methods in IR.
