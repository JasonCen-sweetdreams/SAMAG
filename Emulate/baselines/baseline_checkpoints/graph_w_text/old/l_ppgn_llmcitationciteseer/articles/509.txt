Coordinating multiple agents in dynamic environments is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HiGAT) that enables efficient cooperation among agents in complex scenarios. HiGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent interactions and incorporates a hierarchical framework to handle varying levels of abstraction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGAT in several benchmark environments, including a simulated search-and-rescue mission and a robotic soccer game. Experimental results show that HiGAT outperforms existing methods in terms of cooperation efficiency and adaptability to changing environments.
