Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in knowledge graph construction, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in a text. However, existing approaches struggle to scale to large knowledge graphs with millions of entities. We propose a novel graph attention network-based approach, 'GraphDisambiguate', that leverages the structural information in the knowledge graph to disambiguate entities. Our experiments on the YAGO and DBpedia datasets demonstrate that GraphDisambiguate achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significant reduction in computational time.
