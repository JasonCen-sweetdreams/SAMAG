As Virtual Reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding user engagement is crucial for designing effective VR experiences. This paper explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user engagement in VR. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, manipulating avatar personalization and tracking user behavior, self-reported engagement, and cognitive load. Results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, particularly for female participants, and reduce cognitive load. We discuss implications for VR system design and provide guidelines for creating effective personalized avatars.
