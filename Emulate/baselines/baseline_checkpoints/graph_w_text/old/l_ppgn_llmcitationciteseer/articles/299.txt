Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to optimize query plans. We model the query optimization problem as a graph optimization problem and use GNNs to learn the optimal query plan. Our approach is able to capture the complex dependencies between query operators and optimize the query plan efficiently. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x.
