Multi-agent systems operating in dynamic environments face the challenge of negotiating resource allocation and task assignment amongst agents. This paper presents a novel autonomous negotiation strategy, 'DynaNeg', which leverages reinforcement learning and dynamic game theory to adapt to changing environmental conditions. DynaNeg enables agents to learn effective negotiation tactics, balance individual goals with collective objectives, and respond to unexpected events. We evaluate DynaNeg in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved resource allocation efficiency and enhanced system resilience compared to traditional negotiation protocols.
