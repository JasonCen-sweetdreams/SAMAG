Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and IoT. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to identify relevant patterns at multiple scales and hierarchical levels, enabling the detection of complex anomalies. We propose a new attention-based feature importance metric, dubbed 'AnomalyRelevance', to provide interpretable explanations for the detected anomalies. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while offering meaningful insights into the underlying data.
