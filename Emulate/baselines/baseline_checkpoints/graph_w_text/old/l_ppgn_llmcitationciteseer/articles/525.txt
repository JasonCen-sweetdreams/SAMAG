Zero-shot image classification remains a challenging task in computer vision, particularly when faced with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, dubbed HierCon, which leverages the compositional structure of objects to improve zero-shot learning. HierCon combines a novel hierarchical attention mechanism with a contrastive loss function, encouraging the model to learn robust, high-level representations that generalize to unseen classes. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the potential of HierCon for real-world applications.
