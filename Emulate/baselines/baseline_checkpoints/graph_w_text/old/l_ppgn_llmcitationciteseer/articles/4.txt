Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of graph data and the need to balance query latency with resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process and design a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn an optimal query plan generator. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
