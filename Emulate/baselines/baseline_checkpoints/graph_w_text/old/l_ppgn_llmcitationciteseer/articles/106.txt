Optimizing query execution plans in distributed database systems is a complex problem. Traditional approaches rely on rule-based or cost-based optimization, which may not adapt well to changing workloads and system dynamics. We propose a novel reinforcement learning-based approach, 'RL-Optimizer', which learns to optimize query execution plans by interacting with the database system. Our experiments on a distributed database benchmark show that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization. We also demonstrate the adaptability of RL-Optimizer to changing workloads and system configurations.
