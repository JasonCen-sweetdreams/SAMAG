Coordinating multi-agent systems to achieve complex tasks is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel approach that combines hierarchical task decomposition with reinforcement learning to enable efficient coordination in large-scale multi-agent environments. Our method, called Hierarchical Agent Coordination (HAC), decomposes tasks into sub-tasks and assigns them to agents based on their capabilities and preferences. We then employ reinforcement learning to optimize agent policies and coordination strategies. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that HAC outperforms traditional planning-based approaches in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
