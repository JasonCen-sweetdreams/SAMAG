This paper presents a novel approach to designing gesture-based interfaces for older adults with motor impairments. Our system, 'EasyGest', uses machine learning to adapt to individual users' abilities and preferences, optimizing gesture recognition accuracy and reducing fatigue. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in interaction speed and satisfaction compared to traditional gesture-based interfaces. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and accessible interfaces for older adults with motor impairments, enabling them to fully engage with digital technologies.
