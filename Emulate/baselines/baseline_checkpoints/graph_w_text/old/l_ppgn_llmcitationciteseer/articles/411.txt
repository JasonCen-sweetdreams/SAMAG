In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks among agents. Our method, called GNN-TA, learns to represent agent capabilities and task requirements as graph embeddings, enabling agents to make autonomous decisions without central coordination. We evaluate GNN-TA on a series of simulated scenarios, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional auction-based methods.
