Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current VR interfaces often exclude users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces that accommodate users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key accessibility barriers and developed a set of design guidelines for creating accessible VR interactions. Our evaluation with 30 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing VR interfaces.
