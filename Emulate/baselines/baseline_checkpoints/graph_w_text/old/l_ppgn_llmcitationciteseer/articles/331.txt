Relational reinforcement learning (RRL) seeks to learn policies that generalize across diverse relational structures. We propose a novel hierarchical attention graph neural network (HAGNN) architecture that leverages the compositional nature of relational data. HAGNN utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant entities and relations, and integrates graph convolutional layers to capture complex structural patterns. Experiments on several RRL benchmarks demonstrate that HAGNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both sample efficiency and policy performance.
