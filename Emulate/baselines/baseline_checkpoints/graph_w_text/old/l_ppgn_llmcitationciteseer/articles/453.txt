Autonomous agents often need to allocate tasks in a decentralized manner, particularly in applications such as search and rescue, or environmental monitoring. This paper proposes a novel approach to decentralized task allocation using graph neural networks (GNNs). We define a heterogeneous graph structure that captures the relationships between agents, tasks, and the environment. By leveraging GNNs, our approach enables agents to learn a distributed allocation policy that adapts to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate improved task allocation efficiency and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional distributed optimization methods.
