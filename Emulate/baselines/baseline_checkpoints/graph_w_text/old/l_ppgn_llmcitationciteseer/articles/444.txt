Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between query terms and document contents. By training a neural encoder to capture contextualized embeddings of query and document representations, NeuroQE generates high-quality expansion terms that improve the retrieval performance of a baseline BM25 model. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that NeuroQE achieves significant gains in mean average precision and recall, outperforming existing query expansion techniques.
