In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often rely on complex interactions between agents. However, the lack of transparency in these interactions hinders the understanding of agent behavior. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture to address this issue. HAN combines self-attention mechanisms with hierarchical clustering to identify influential agents and their roles in the decision-making process. Experimental results on a real-world traffic simulation dataset demonstrate that HAN improves explainability and decision quality compared to traditional reinforcement learning approaches.
