Temporal graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale networks with evolving relationships. However, the complexity of temporal graphs poses significant challenges for indexing and query optimization. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, TempGraphIX, which leverages a combination of temporal partitioning, graph summarization, and adaptive query rewriting to accelerate query processing. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that selects the most efficient query plan based on the underlying graph structure and query patterns. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TempGraphIX achieves up to 5x performance improvement over existing indexing techniques for temporal graph queries.
