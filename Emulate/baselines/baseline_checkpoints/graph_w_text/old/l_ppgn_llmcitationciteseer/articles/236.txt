In e-commerce, autonomous agents can facilitate efficient and personalized trade negotiations. This paper presents a novel framework for multi-agent negotiation, 'ANES', which integrates machine learning-based opponent modeling with game-theoretic analysis. ANES enables agents to adapt their negotiation strategies based on opponent behavior, leading to higher agreement rates and improved outcomes. We evaluate ANES in a simulated e-commerce environment, demonstrating its effectiveness in various scenarios and its robustness to different opponent types.
