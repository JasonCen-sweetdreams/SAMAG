Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often rely on query expansion techniques to improve retrieval performance. However, selecting the most informative expansion terms remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'QL-Expander', which learns to optimize query expansion policies for ad-hoc retrieval. Our approach leverages a combination of term importance estimation and contextualized language modeling to guide the expansion process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QL-Expander outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
