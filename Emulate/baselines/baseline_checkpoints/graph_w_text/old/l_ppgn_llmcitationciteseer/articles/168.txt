This study investigates the effects of personalized avatar embodiment on user experience in virtual reality (VR) environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, who were randomly assigned to either a personalized or non-personalized avatar condition. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased feelings of presence, engagement, and emotional arousal in VR. Furthermore, we found that users with personalized avatars exhibited more confident and exploratory behavior in the virtual environment. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of VR-based training, education, and therapy applications.
