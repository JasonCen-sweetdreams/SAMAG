Smart home systems have the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. However, existing systems often require explicit user input to adapt to individual needs, which can be time-consuming and cognitively demanding. This paper presents a novel approach to eliciting user preferences for personalized accessibility in smart homes. We develop a machine learning-based framework that infers user preferences from subtle behavioral cues, such as gaze patterns and navigation habits. Our approach is evaluated through a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction and reduced effort compared to traditional explicit input methods.
