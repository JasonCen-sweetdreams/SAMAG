Cloud-native database systems have revolutionized the way enterprises manage their data, offering scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. However, multi-tenancy, a key feature of cloud-native databases, poses significant query optimization challenges. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'TENOPT', which leverages machine learning and graph-based techniques to efficiently optimize queries in multi-tenant environments. We develop a tenant-aware query cost model and a graph-based optimization algorithm that minimizes resource contention and maximizes query performance. Experimental results on a cloud-native database system demonstrate that TENOPT achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance and 2x reduction in resource utilization compared to existing optimization techniques.
