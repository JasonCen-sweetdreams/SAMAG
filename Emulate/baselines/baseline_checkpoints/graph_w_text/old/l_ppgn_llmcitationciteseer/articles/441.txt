In complex multi-robot systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient decision-making to optimize performance. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework, 'HRTA', that decomposes the task allocation problem into a hierarchical structure of high-level tasks and low-level actions. HRTA leverages a novel combination of Monte Carlo tree search and deep Q-networks to learn an optimal policy for task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse robotics scenario demonstrate that HRTA outperforms existing approaches in terms of task completion time, robot utilization, and adaptability to changing environments.
