Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph structures and the distributed nature of the data. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, called GraphRL, learns to select optimal query plans by interacting with the database and receiving feedback in the form of execution times. We evaluate GraphRL on a real-world graph dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance compared to traditional optimization techniques.
