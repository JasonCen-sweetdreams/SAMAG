Short-text retrieval is a challenging task in information retrieval due to the limited context and sparse term frequency. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach that incorporates both semantic and syntactic features of the query terms. We leverage pre-trained language models to generate contextualized embeddings, which are then used to select the most informative expansion terms. Our approach is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, including the TREC Microblog track, and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
