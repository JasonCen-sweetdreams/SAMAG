The rapid growth of digital data has made efficient document retrieval a crucial task in information retrieval systems. This paper presents a novel approach to document indexing using hierarchical neural networks. Our proposed method, Hierarchical Neural Indexing (HNI), leverages the strengths of both keyword-based and semantic-based retrieval methods. HNI learns a hierarchical representation of documents, enabling efficient filtering and ranking of relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
