Open-domain question answering (ODQA) models rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents from a large corpus. This paper proposes a novel approach to passage retrieval using hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs). Our model, HierPass, represents the document collection as a hierarchical graph, where nodes correspond to passages and edges capture semantic relationships. We learn node representations using a graph neural network and a novel attention mechanism that weighs the importance of neighboring nodes. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HierPass outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, achieving a 25% reduction in retrieval time compared to the best baseline.
