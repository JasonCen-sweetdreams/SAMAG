Distributed database systems (DDBS) have become increasingly prevalent in modern data centers, but optimizing query execution plans (QEPs) remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize QEPs for DDBS. Our RL framework, 'RL-Optimizer', learns to select the optimal QEP based on the underlying system dynamics and query characteristics. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world DDBS benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and system throughput compared to traditional optimization techniques.
