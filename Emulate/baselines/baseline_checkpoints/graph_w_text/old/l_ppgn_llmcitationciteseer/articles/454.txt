Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as text, audio, and video, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features for emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention modules and a hierarchical fusion mechanism, which enables it to capture both intra-modality and inter-modality relationships. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal data.
