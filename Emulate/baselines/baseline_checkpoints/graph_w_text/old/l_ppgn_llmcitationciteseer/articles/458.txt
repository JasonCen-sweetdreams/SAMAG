In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a novel approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to autonomous agents in a decentralized manner. Our method, called Dec-GNN, models the agent-task relationships as a graph and leverages GNNs to learn a distributed task allocation policy. We show that Dec-GNN outperforms traditional decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion time and resource utilization in simulated environments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of Dec-GNN to real-world scenarios involving autonomous robots.
