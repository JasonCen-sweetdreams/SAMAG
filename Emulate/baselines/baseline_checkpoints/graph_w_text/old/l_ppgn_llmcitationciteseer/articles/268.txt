Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various fields, but its accessibility for users with visual impairments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual impairments. We introduce a set of guidelines and design principles that focus on auditory and haptic feedback, spatial awareness, and navigation assistance. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving the overall VR experience for users with visual impairments. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of accessible VR design and provide valuable insights for the development of more inclusive VR applications.
