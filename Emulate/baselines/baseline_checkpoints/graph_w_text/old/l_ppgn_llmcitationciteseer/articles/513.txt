The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of real-time data streams, necessitating efficient query optimization techniques for timely analytics. This paper presents 'StreamOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages both data and query characteristics to minimize latency and maximize throughput. We introduce a probabilistic cost model that accounts for data stream dynamics and query semantics, enabling the optimizer to make informed decisions about join ordering, aggregation, and indexing. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that StreamOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
