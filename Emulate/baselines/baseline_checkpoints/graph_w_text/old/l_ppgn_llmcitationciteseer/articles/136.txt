Dense retrieval has become a popular paradigm for information retrieval tasks, but its computational cost and memory requirements can be prohibitive for large-scale datasets. This paper introduces HiDR, a novel hierarchical document representation that enables efficient query-based dense retrieval. HiDR leverages a multi-resolution representation of documents, where each level captures different granularities of semantic meaning. We propose a query-dependent aggregation mechanism that adaptively selects the most relevant document embedding levels, reducing the number of required similarity computations. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiDR achieves comparable retrieval performance to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational cost by up to 75%.
