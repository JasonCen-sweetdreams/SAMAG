Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using neural semantic embeddings, dubbed 'NSE-QE'. By leveraging pre-trained language models to encode query terms and documents, NSE-QE generates context-aware expansions that better capture the underlying semantic relationships. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the effect of embedding dimensions and query term weighting on retrieval performance.
