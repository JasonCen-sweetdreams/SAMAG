Conversational interfaces have transformed human-computer interaction, but their accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This study investigates the design of inclusive conversational agents that accommodate the needs of this demographic. We propose a novel framework, 'CogTalk', which integrates cognitive load management, semantic simplification, and emotional support mechanisms. A user study with 30 participants reveals that CogTalk significantly improves task completion rates, reduces cognitive load, and enhances user satisfaction compared to traditional conversational interfaces.
