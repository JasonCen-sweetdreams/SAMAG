Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to bridge the gap between user queries and relevant documents. Existing methods often rely on term co-occurrence or word embeddings, which may not capture the nuanced semantic relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach, 'GraphExpan', which represents query terms as nodes in a semantic graph and leverages graph convolutional networks to learn expanded query representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphExpan outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
