Real-time analytics has become a crucial aspect of modern data-driven applications. However, optimizing query workloads for distributed database systems remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization, dubbed 'DynaOpt', which leverages machine learning-based workload characterization and adaptive query scheduling. DynaOpt dynamically adjusts query priorities and resource allocation to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale distributed database system demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
