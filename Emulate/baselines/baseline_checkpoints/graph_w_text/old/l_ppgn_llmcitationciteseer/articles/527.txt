Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query results. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate query expansion as a Markov decision process, where the RL agent learns to select relevant expansion terms based on their expected impact on retrieval performance. Our proposed method, 'RL-QE', outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain. We also demonstrate the robustness of RL-QE to varying query types and lengths.
