Conversational AI systems rely on accurate intent detection to provide relevant responses. Existing approaches often struggle with handling complex, multi-turn dialogues. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that models conversations as graphs, capturing relationships between utterances, entities, and intents. HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving a 12.5% relative improvement in intent detection accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a real-world conversational AI system, showcasing its potential for improving user experience.
