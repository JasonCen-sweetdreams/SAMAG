Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the speech patterns and cognitive load of older adults interacting with voice assistants. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+, analyzing their speech input, error rates, and self-reported cognitive load. Our results show that older adults face significant challenges with voice assistants, including linguistic complexity, memory recall, and frustration. We propose a set of design guidelines for more inclusive voice assistants, incorporating simpler language, personalized feedback, and adaptive dialogue flows to reduce cognitive load and improve user experience.
