This paper presents a novel approach to designing adaptive gesture recognition systems for individuals with motor impairments. We propose a machine learning framework that leverages electromyography (EMG) signals to classify gestures, and adapts to individual users' abilities through a personalized transfer learning process. Our system, ' GestureAid', is evaluated on a dataset of 20 participants with varying levels of motor impairment, achieving an average accuracy of 92.1% and outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. We also conduct a user study to assess the system's usability and user experience, revealing significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction.
