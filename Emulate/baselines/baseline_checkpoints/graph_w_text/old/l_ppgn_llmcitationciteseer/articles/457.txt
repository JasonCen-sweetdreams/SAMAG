This paper presents a novel neural ranking model, 'HetRank', designed for efficient document retrieval in heterogeneous information networks. HetRank leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between entities and documents, while incorporating a retrieval-oriented objective function to optimize ranking performance. Our experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HetRank outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications such as search engines and recommender systems.
