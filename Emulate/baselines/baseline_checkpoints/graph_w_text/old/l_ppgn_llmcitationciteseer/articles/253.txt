In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive solutions. This paper proposes a novel approach based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. We model the agent-task interactions as a graph and leverage the expressive power of GNNs to learn a task allocation policy. Our approach can handle large-scale systems and dynamic task arrivals, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations on various scenarios, including disaster response and autonomous vehicle coordination.
