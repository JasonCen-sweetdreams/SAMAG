Time-series databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large volumes of temporal data. However, existing indexing techniques face limitations in handling complex queries, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the strengths of tree-based and hash-based indexing methods. Our proposed 'HybridTS' index leverages a hierarchical tree structure to efficiently prune unnecessary branches and incorporates a hash-based component to facilitate fast lookup and aggregation operations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HybridTS outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query processing times while maintaining comparable storage overhead.
