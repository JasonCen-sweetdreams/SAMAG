Modern distributed database systems often employ multiple indexing techniques to accelerate query execution. However, the optimal index selection strategy remains an open challenge, particularly in dynamic and heterogeneous environments. This paper proposes 'AdapIndex', a novel framework that adaptively selects the most effective index configuration based on workload characteristics and system resources. We develop a machine learning-based approach to predict query patterns and adjust the index selection accordingly. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AdapIndex significantly outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques, achieving up to 3.5x improvement in query performance.
