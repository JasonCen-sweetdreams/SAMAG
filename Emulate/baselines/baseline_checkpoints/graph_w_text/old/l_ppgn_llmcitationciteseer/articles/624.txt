Object detection is a crucial task in autonomous vehicles, requiring accurate and efficient processing of visual data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical multi-task learning framework, 'HMTRL', which jointly optimizes object detection, classification, and tracking tasks. By sharing knowledge across tasks and leveraging a hierarchical feature representation, HMTRL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI object detection benchmark while reducing computational overhead by 30%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HMTRL in real-world autonomous driving scenarios, highlighting its potential for widespread adoption in the automotive industry.
