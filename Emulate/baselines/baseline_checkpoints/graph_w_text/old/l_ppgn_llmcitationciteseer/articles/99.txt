Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve search results. Traditional query expansion methods rely on lexical and semantic analysis, but often struggle with limited context and domain-specific knowledge. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'QNNet', which leverages pre-trained language models to learn context-aware query representations. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QNNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly for complex and ambiguous queries.
