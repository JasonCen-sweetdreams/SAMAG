This paper addresses the challenging problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities must collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel decentralized approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn optimal task assignments in a distributed manner. Our method, called 'HTA-DRL', utilizes a graph neural network to represent the agent-task interactions and a decentralized Q-learning algorithm to update the task assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that HTA-DRL outperforms existing centralized and decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to changing system dynamics.
