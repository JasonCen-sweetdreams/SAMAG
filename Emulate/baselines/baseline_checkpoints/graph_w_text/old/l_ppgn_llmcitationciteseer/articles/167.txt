Traditional query expansion techniques rely on manual feature engineering and suffer from limited semantic understanding. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures contextual relationships between query terms and document entities, enabling more accurate expansion of relevant keywords. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
