Explainable recommendation systems are crucial in building trust with users. However, existing methods often rely on simplistic feature attribution, neglecting complex relationships between users and items. This paper introduces HGARec, a hierarchical graph attention network that models user-item interactions as a multi-level graph. By recursively applying attention mechanisms, HGARec captures both local and global patterns, providing fine-grained explanations for recommendations. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGARec in terms of recommendation accuracy and interpretability.
