Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but the cognitive implications of embodied experiences remain understudied. This paper investigates the effects of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load, spatial awareness, and user engagement in VR environments. Our user study involving 40 participants reveals that embodied cognition principles can be leveraged to design more intuitive and immersive VR interfaces, particularly for complex tasks. We discuss the implications of our findings for HCI design and provide recommendations for future research.
