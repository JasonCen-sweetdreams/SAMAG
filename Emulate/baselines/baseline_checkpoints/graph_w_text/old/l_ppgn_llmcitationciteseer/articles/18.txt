This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation for multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'RL-Allocator', which enables agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing task requirements. Our approach integrates a graph neural network with a deep Q-network to model agent-agent interactions and task relationships. Experimental results on a simulated rescue scenario demonstrate that RL-Allocator outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and agent utility. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the framework's convergence properties.
