Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning techniques to optimize query plans. Our method, called 'DQO', uses a graph neural network to learn the structural properties of query plans and predict optimal execution paths. We evaluate DQO on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional rule-based optimizers.
