Spatio-temporal databases require efficient query processing to support various applications, such as location-based services and IoT analytics. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, ST-HyperTree, which leverages a hybrid approach combining grid-based and tree-based indexing. ST-HyperTree adapts to varying data distributions and query workloads, achieving significant performance improvements over existing indexing methods. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach reduces query latency by up to 3x and improves throughput by up to 5x.
