Neural retrieval models have shown great promise in information retrieval tasks, but their performance is often hindered by the limited context of the query. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using graph-based keyword extraction. We leverage graph convolutional networks to model the relationships between keywords and identify the most informative terms to expand the query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the retrieval performance of state-of-the-art neural models, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
