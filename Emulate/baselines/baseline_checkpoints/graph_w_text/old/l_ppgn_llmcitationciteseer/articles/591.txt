In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for optimal performance. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using hierarchical reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel hierarchical architecture, consisting of a high-level manager agent and multiple low-level worker agents, which learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities and the system's overall objective. Our approach is evaluated on a simulated robotics scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
