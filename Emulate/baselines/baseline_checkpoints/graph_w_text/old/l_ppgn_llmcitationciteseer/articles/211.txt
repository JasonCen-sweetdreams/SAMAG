Explainable recommendation systems are crucial for building trust with users. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both item-level and user-level attention mechanisms. Our approach enables the model to focus on the most relevant features and interactions, providing transparent and personalized recommendations. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
