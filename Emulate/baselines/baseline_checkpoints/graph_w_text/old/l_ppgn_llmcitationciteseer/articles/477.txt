This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that enables agents to learn optimal task assignment strategies in a distributed manner. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and task dependencies, and incorporates a value-based reinforcement learning framework to optimize task allocation. Experimental results on a variety of scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving system performance and adaptability compared to traditional centralized methods.
