Graph query optimization is a fundamental problem in modern databases, with many real-world applications relying on efficient graph processing. This paper presents a novel approach to graph query optimization using learned index structures. By leveraging machine learning models to predict query patterns, we develop a scalable and adaptive indexing framework that significantly reduces query latency and improves throughput. Our experiments on large-scale graph datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2x better storage efficiency.
