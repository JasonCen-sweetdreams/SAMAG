Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights into the anomaly generation process. Our HAN model employs a hierarchical encoder to capture both local and global patterns in the time series data, and an attention mechanism to highlight the most relevant features contributing to the anomaly. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies and providing interpretable explanations.
