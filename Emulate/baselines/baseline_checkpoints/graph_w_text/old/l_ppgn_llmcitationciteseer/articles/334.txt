Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where a set of tasks needs to be assigned to a team of agents with varying capabilities and resource constraints. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach, called DAGAT, leverages GCNs to learn a robust and adaptive task allocation policy that minimizes communication overhead and maximizes system performance. Experimental results on a simulated multi-agent system show that DAGAT outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
