Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, optimizing queries for distributed graph databases remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed graph databases. Our method, called GraphQLearn, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the graph structure, query patterns, and system resources. Experimental results on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphQLearn improves query performance by up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
