Effective query intent classification is crucial for e-commerce search engines to provide relevant results. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach, GraphIC, which leverages graph-based clustering to identify latent query intent patterns. We represent search queries as nodes in a graph, where edges are weighted by their semantic similarity. Our method iteratively refines query clusters by minimizing a novel graph-based objective function, resulting in more accurate intent classification. Experiments on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that GraphIC outperforms state-of-the-art supervised models, particularly for rare and nuanced intent categories.
