In multi-agent systems, effective negotiation strategies are crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel autonomous negotiation framework, 'DynaNego', which leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic environments. DynaNego agents learn to adjust their negotiation tactics based on real-time feedback from the environment, leading to improved agreement rates and reduced negotiation time. Experimental results in a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate the efficacy of DynaNego in achieving efficient and fair agreements among self-interested agents.
