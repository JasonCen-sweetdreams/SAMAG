Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture the semantic intent behind user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using neural query graph embeddings, which learns to represent queries as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space. Our method, dubbed 'NQGE', leverages graph neural networks to model the complex relationships between query terms, and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness on several benchmark datasets. We also show that NQGE can be seamlessly integrated into existing retrieval frameworks, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.
