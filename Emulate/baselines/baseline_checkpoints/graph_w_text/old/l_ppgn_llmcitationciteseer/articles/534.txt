Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements. We then developed and evaluated a VR interface that incorporates these requirements, including simplified navigation, high-contrast visuals, and multimodal feedback. Our results show that older adults with cognitive impairments can effectively use and benefit from our designed VR interface, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in VR development.
