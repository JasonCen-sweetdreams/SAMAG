The increasing adoption of RDF data models in various domains has led to a growing need for efficient query optimization techniques in distributed RDF databases. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning algorithms to predict optimal query execution plans. Our method, called RDF-ML, uses a combination of feature extraction and supervised learning to minimize query response times and reduce network overhead. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RDF-ML outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and 25% in terms of network traffic reduction.
