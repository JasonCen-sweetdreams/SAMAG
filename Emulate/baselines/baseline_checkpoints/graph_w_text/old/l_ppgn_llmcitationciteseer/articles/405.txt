Short text retrieval poses significant challenges due to the limited context and ambiguity of query terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of query terms and expand them with relevant synonyms and related concepts. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, improving the mean average precision by up to 15%. We also show that DeepQE is efficient and scalable, making it suitable for real-world search engines.
