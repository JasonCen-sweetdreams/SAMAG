Distributed search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving documents from a vast, partitioned index. This paper proposes an Elastic Ranking Model (ERM) that adapts to the dynamic query workload and document collection. ERM leverages a hierarchical framework to learn a set of latent factors that capture the semantic relationships between queries and documents. We develop a novel online learning algorithm that updates the model parameters in response to user interactions, ensuring accurate ranking and efficient query processing. Experimental results on a large-scale web dataset demonstrate that ERM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and query latency.
