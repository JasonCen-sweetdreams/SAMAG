Time series forecasting is a crucial task in many applications, but the lack of interpretability in modern deep learning models hinders their adoption in high-stakes domains. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to highlight relevant temporal patterns and features. We evaluate HAN on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and providing visual explanations for the predicted outcomes. Our approach enables practitioners to identify key drivers of forecasting errors and make informed decisions.
