Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based applications, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HAT-GNN', which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to detect and defend against adversarial attacks on GNNs. Our method learns to identify suspicious patterns in graph structures and node features, and adaptively adjusts the attention weights to focus on the most reliable nodes. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAT-GNN outperforms existing defense methods in detecting adversarial attacks, while maintaining competitive performance on clean data.
