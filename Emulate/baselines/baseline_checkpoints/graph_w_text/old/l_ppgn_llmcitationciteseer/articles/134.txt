Conversational AI systems struggle to accurately detect user intent due to the complexity of natural language and the lack of transparency in existing models. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework, which leverages graph-based representations to capture contextual relationships between utterances and intents. By incorporating explainable attention mechanisms, HGAT provides interpretable intent detection results, outperforming state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in a real-world conversational AI system, showcasing its potential to improve user experience and trust.
