Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often struggle with the vocabulary mismatch problem, where the query terms fail to capture the essence of the user's information need. Query expansion techniques can mitigate this issue, but their effectiveness relies on the quality of the expanded terms. This paper proposes a novel approach, ReinforceQE, which employs reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query expansion policy. We model the query expansion process as a Markov decision process and use a deep Q-network to learn the optimal expansion strategy. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that ReinforceQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of MAP and NDCG.
