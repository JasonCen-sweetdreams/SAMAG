This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed an immersive VR experiment where participants performed a series of tasks using either gestures or traditional controllers. Our results show that gesture-based interaction enhances spatial awareness and cognitive load, while also improving user experience. We analyze the implications of embodied cognition on VR interface design and discuss the potential applications in areas such as education, training, and therapy.
