Autonomous traffic control systems aim to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'DMTRL', which enables autonomous agents to learn optimal traffic signal control policies in real-time. DMTRL leverages graph neural networks to model complex traffic dynamics and incorporates a novel distributed Q-learning algorithm that adapts to changing traffic conditions. We demonstrate the efficacy of DMTRL in a realistic simulation environment, showcasing significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional traffic control methods.
