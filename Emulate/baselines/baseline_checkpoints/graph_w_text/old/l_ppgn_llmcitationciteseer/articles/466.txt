In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a hierarchical framework, 'AgentTA', which combines a high-level task allocator with low-level agent controllers. The allocator learns to assign tasks to agents based on their capabilities and environmental context, while the controllers adapt to changing task requirements through reinforcement learning. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that AgentTA outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency.
