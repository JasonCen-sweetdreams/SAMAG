Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has been a crucial component in various artificial intelligence applications. However, existing KGE methods struggle to capture the complex hierarchical and non-Euclidean structure of knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a novel approach, HyperKGE, which leverages hyperbolic geometry to learn more accurate and informative representations of entities and relations. We theoretically analyze the advantages of hyperbolic space and demonstrate the efficacy of HyperKGE on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in link prediction and node classification tasks.
