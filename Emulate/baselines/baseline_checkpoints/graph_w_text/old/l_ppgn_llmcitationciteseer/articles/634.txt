Deep learning models have become increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can manipulate model predictions. Existing detection methods often rely on statistical analysis or feature extraction, but these approaches can be ineffective against sophisticated attacks. This paper proposes a novel graph-based anomaly detection framework, 'GraphSentry', that leverages the structural properties of the input data to identify adversarial samples. Our approach constructs a graph representation of the input data and applies graph-based clustering to detect anomalous patterns. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphSentry outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.
