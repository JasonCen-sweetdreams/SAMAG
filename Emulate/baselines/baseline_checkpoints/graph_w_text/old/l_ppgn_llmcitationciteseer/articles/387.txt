Distributed database systems have become ubiquitous in modern data processing, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to adapt to changing workloads and system conditions. Our method, 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to select the optimal query plan based on a set of features extracted from the query and system state. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that RL-Opt outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
