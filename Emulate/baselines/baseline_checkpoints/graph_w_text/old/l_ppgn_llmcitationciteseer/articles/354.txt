Virtual assistants are increasingly integrated into our daily lives, but their security remains a concern. This paper presents a novel gaze-based authentication approach for intelligent virtual assistants, leveraging eye movement patterns to verify user identities. We propose a deep learning-based framework that captures and analyzes eye movements during user interactions, extracting unique biometric features. Our evaluation demonstrates a significant improvement in authentication accuracy (97.5%) compared to traditional password-based methods, while maintaining a low false rejection rate. This approach has the potential to enhance the security and usability of virtual assistants in various applications.
