Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and provide high availability. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and use a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan. Our approach is able to adapt to changing database statistics and workload patterns, resulting in improved query performance and reduced latency. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving up to 30% improvement in query performance compared to traditional optimization techniques.
