Materialized views are essential in data warehousing and business intelligence applications, but maintaining them in distributed database systems poses significant scalability challenges. This paper presents a novel incremental view maintenance approach, 'DynaView', that leverages a combination of data streaming, caching, and adaptive sampling to minimize view refresh latency and reduce network overhead. Our experiments on a distributed relational database system demonstrate that DynaView outperforms existing solutions by up to 3x in terms of view maintenance throughput and up to 2x in terms of average query response time.
