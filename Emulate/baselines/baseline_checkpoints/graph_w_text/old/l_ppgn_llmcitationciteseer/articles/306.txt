This paper proposes a novel autonomous agent-based negotiation framework for efficient multi-resource allocation in smart grids. We design a multi-agent system where agents, representing different stakeholders, negotiate over resources such as energy, storage, and bandwidth. Our approach integrates a hybrid negotiation strategy combining argumentation-based reasoning with machine learning-based opponent modeling. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid environment demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of allocation efficiency, fairness, and robustness to dynamic changes.
