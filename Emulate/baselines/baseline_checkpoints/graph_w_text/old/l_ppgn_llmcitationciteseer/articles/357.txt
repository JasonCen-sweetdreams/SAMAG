Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, particularly for short texts where query representation is limited. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our model, called HQE-Net, consists of a stacked encoder-decoder architecture that captures both local and global context in the query-document interactions. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQE-Net significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
