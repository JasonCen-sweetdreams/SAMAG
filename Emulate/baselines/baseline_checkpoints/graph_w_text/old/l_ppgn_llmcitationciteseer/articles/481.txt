Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph patterns and the need to minimize communication overhead. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization, query rewriting, and cost-based optimization. We demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time and reduces network communication by up to 50%. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.
