Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but current interfaces often neglect the role of bodily experiences in shaping user behavior. This paper investigates the application of embodied cognition principles to VR design, focusing on gestural interfaces that leverage users' motor skills and proprioception. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, comparing a gesture-based interface to traditional controller-based input methods. Results show significant improvements in user engagement, task performance, and overall experience when using gestural interfaces. Our findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and immersive VR experiences.
