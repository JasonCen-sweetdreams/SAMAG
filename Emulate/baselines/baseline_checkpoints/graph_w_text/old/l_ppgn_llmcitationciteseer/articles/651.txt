Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, aiming to enhance the retrieval performance by incorporating relevant terms into the original query. However, existing methods often rely on simplistic assumeations about term dependencies, leading to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a novel context-aware embedding-based approach, CAQE, which leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and their contextual information to generate more effective expansions. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
