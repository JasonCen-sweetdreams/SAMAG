Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the relevance of search results. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. We propose a neural query expansion model, NQE, which learns to generate expanded queries from a large dataset of user queries and documents. NQE uses a combination of word embedding and recurrent neural networks to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that NQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in retrieval accuracy.
