In this paper, we address the challenging problem of task allocation in decentralized multi-agent systems. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn efficient task allocation policies. Our method, called DMAS-TA, uses a decentralized actor-critic framework to learn a policy that maps agent observations to task assignments. We evaluate DMAS-TA in a variety of simulated environments and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system efficiency compared to traditional, centralized allocation methods. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to changes in agent capabilities and environmental dynamics.
