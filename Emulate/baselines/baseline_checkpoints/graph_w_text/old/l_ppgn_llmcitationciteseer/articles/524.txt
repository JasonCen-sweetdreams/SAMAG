Collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems often rely on matrix factorization or neighborhood-based methods, which may not effectively capture complex item relationships. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, 'RankGNN', that learns to rank items by modeling their graph structure and node features. We leverage a self-attention mechanism to compute node representations and a ranking loss function to optimize the model. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RankGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and A/B testing metrics.
