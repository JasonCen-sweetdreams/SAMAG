Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but their query representation capabilities remain limited. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, HyperQEX, which leverages hyperbolic embeddings to model semantic relationships between query terms. By learning a hyperbolic query representation, HyperQEX can effectively capture nuanced context and improve retrieval performance. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperQEX outperforms existing query expansion methods, particularly for complex, open-domain queries.
