Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a widely used technique to improve retrieval performance, but it often relies on manual feature engineering and heuristics. This paper proposes a neural query embedding-based approach for query expansion, which learns to represent queries and documents in a shared vector space. Our approach, dubbed 'NQE-Expand', utilizes a neural network to encode queries and documents, and then applies a novel expansion strategy based on vector similarity. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQE-Expand outperforms traditional query expansion methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc retrieval.
