Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their interfaces often perpetuate exclusionary design. This paper presents an exploratory study on co-designing voice assistants with people with disabilities, focusing on inclusive dialogue management. We conducted a participatory design workshop with 15 participants with diverse disabilities, identifying key challenges and opportunities for adaptive dialogue strategies. Our findings inform the development of a novel dialogue management framework, 'IncluVA', which incorporates personalized, context-aware responses and explicit error handling. We demonstrate the feasibility of IncluVA through a prototype implementation, highlighting the potential for more accessible and empowering voice interactions.
