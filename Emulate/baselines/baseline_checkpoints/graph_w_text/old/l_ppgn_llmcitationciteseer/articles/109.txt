Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults, but existing systems often struggle to accommodate age-related cognitive and physical declines. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating accessible conversational interfaces, focusing on speech recognition and error recovery mechanisms. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, revealing significant usability issues with commercial speech recognition systems. Our proposed interface design incorporates personalized feedback, error correction, and adaptive dialogue management, resulting in improved user satisfaction and task completion rates.
