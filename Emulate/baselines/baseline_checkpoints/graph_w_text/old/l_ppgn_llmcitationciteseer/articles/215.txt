This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) designed to facilitate explainable communication among multiple agents in complex environments. The proposed architecture consists of two interconnected components: an attention-based message encoder and a hierarchical reasoning module. The encoder learns to extract relevant information from agent observations, while the reasoning module iteratively refines the attention weights to capture nuanced relationships between agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a multi-agent negotiation scenario, showcasing improved communication efficiency and interpretability compared to existing methods.
