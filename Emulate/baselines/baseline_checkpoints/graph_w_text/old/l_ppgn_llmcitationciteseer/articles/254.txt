 Passage retrieval is a crucial component of many information retrieval systems. However, most existing methods rely on fixed document representations, which may not effectively capture the query context. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document representation approach, 'QADR', which dynamically adjusts document embeddings based on the input query. Our method utilizes a transformer-based architecture to learn query-document interactions and generates context-aware document representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QADR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods, achieving an average improvement of 12.1% in MRR@10.
