Deep neural ranking models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but their computational cost and memory requirements limit their applicability to large-scale document collections. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates query expansion techniques with neural ranking models to improve the efficiency of document retrieval. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively expands the query representation based on the relevance of the top-ranked documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces the computational cost by up to 40% while maintaining comparable retrieval performance to existing neural ranking models.
