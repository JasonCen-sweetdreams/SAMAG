Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-structured data, where a model must generalize to new classes with limited labeled examples. This paper proposes a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global graph structures to learn robust node representations. Our model consists of a graph attention module that captures node dependencies at multiple scales, and a hierarchical classification module that incorporates attention weights to adapt to few-shot classes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, especially when the number of shots is extremely small.
