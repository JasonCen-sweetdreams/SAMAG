Multi-hierarchical data warehouses are becoming increasingly popular for storing and querying complex data. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel query rewriting approach, 'HierReWrite', that leverages the hierarchical structure of the data to reduce query execution time. HierReWrite uses a combination of rule-based and cost-based optimization techniques to rewrite complex queries into more efficient ones. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that HierReWrite outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 50% in terms of query execution time.
