Real-time object detection is a crucial task in various applications, including autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention neural network (HANN) architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time object detection. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant regions of the input image, reducing computational overhead while improving detection accuracy. We also introduce a novel anchor-free mechanism that eliminates the need for anchor boxes, further improving speed and accuracy. Experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing real-time object detection methods while maintaining a frame rate of 30 FPS.
