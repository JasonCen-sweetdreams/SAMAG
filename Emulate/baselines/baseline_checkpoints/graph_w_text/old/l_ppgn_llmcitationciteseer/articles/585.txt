Gesture recognition systems have the potential to improve the quality of life for individuals with motor disabilities. However, existing systems often struggle to adapt to the unique needs and abilities of each user. This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive gesture recognition, which leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to personalize the recognition model to each individual's motor patterns. Our system, 'Adapta Gesture', uses a hierarchical Bayesian framework to iteratively update the recognition model based on user feedback, achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction. We evaluate Adapta Gesture with a user study involving 20 participants with motor disabilities, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling more accurate and efficient gesture-based interaction.
