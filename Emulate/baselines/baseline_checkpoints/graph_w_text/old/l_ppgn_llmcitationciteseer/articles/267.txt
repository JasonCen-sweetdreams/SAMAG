Distributed search engines process massive amounts of data, making query expansion a critical step in improving retrieval efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE-Dist', which exploits the structural properties of document collections to reduce the dimensionality of the term space. HQE-Dist employs a two-layered approach, where the first layer applies a clustering-based term selection method, and the second layer performs a relevance-based term weighting scheme. Experimental results on a large-scale web dataset demonstrate that HQE-Dist outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval accuracy and query processing time.
