Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan. Experimental results on a distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
