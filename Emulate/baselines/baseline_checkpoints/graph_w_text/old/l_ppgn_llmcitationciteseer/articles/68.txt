As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the role of interface consistency in shaping user experience is crucial. This study explores the effects of interface consistency on user performance, satisfaction, and cognitive load in VR environments. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, exposing them to consistent and inconsistent interface designs in a VR task-oriented scenario. Results indicate that consistent interfaces significantly improve user performance, reduce cognitive load, and enhance overall user satisfaction. Our findings have implications for the design of VR interfaces, highlighting the importance of consistency in promoting effective and engaging user experiences.
