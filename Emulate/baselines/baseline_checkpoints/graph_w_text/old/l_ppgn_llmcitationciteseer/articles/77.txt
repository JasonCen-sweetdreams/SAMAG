Few-shot node classification is a challenging task, particularly in graph-structured data, where limited labeled nodes are available. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) model that leverages attention mechanisms at multiple scales to adapt to new classes. HAGNN consists of a hierarchical graph encoder, which learns to capture node representations at different granularity, and an attention-based few-shot classifier, which selectively weighs the importance of nodes based on their semantic relevance to the query class. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, especially when dealing with sparse and noisy graphs.
