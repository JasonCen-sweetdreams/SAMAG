Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAN) framework, which integrates graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical graph representation learning. HGAN captures complex item relationships and provides interpretable recommendations by highlighting influential items in the graph. We evaluate HGAN on multiple benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
