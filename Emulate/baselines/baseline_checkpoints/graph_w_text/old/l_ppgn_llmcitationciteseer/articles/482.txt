Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on simple term co-occurrence or word embeddings. This paper proposes a novel approach, HierDoc, which leverages hierarchical document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between queries and documents. Our method represents documents as nodes in a hierarchical graph, allowing for context-aware query expansion and more accurate retrieval. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
