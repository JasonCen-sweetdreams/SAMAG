Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel two-stage retrieval framework, 'DPRank', which leverages dense passage representations and a hierarchical ranking mechanism to improve both recall and precision. We introduce a novel document expansion strategy that incorporates keyword extraction and semantic search to further enhance the retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on the Natural Questions benchmark demonstrate that DPRank outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval models, achieving a 15% increase in recall and a 20% increase in precision.
