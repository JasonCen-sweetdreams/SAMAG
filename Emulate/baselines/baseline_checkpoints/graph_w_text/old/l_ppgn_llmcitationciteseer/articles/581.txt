In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent settings. Our HAN model captures inter-agent relationships and reasons about their interactions using a hierarchical attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of multi-agent scenarios, including autonomous driving and smart grids, and show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of decision quality and interpretability.
