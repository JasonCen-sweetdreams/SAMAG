In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents with diverse capabilities and constraints. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to efficiently allocate tasks in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Our approach utilizes a novel constraint relaxation technique that allows agents to iteratively refine their task assignments based on local information and intermittent communication with neighboring agents. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
