In decentralized multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. Traditional approaches rely on centralized authorities or assume trusted agents. This paper proposes a blockchain-based reputation system, 'RepuChain', that enables autonomous agents to evaluate and select trustworthy peers for task allocation. We design a novel consensus mechanism that integrates reputation scores with smart contracts, ensuring fair task distribution and preventing malicious behavior. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of RepuChain in improving task completion rates and reducing agent failures.
