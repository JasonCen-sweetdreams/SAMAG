Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, where the goal is to predict the labels of nodes in a graph. Recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results, but they often neglect the hierarchical structure inherent in many real-world graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) model, which leverages attention mechanisms to capture both local and global hierarchical relationships in the graph. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially on graphs with complex hierarchical structures.
