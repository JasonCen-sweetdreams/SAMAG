This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion for ad-hoc retrieval, leveraging context-aware embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'ConEx', learns to represent queries and documents in a shared vector space, incorporating both local and global context information. We demonstrate that ConEx outperforms state-of-the-art expansion techniques on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall. Furthermore, we show that ConEx can be effectively combined with existing retrieval models to enhance overall search performance.
