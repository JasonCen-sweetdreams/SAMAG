Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their adoption by older adults with cognitive impairments is hindered by existing design limitations. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants that cater to the unique needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings informed the development of 'CARE', a novel voice assistant prototype that incorporates cognitive support features, such as proactive reminders, simplified dialogue flows, and personalized feedback. Evaluation results show significant improvements in user engagement, task completion, and overall satisfaction among older adults with cognitive impairments.
