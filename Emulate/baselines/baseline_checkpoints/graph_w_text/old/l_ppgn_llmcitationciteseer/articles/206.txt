Traditional information retrieval systems rely on keyword-based matching, which often fails to capture nuanced query semantics. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'QueryGCN', which leverages graph convolutional networks to learn query-document relationships. We represent queries as graphs, where nodes correspond to query terms and edges encode their semantic relationships. QueryGCN then performs node-wise aggregation to generate a query representation, which is used to re-rank documents. Experimental results on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate that QueryGCN outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving a 15% increase in NDCG@10.
