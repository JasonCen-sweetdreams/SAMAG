Individuals with motor impairments often face challenges in interacting with gesture-based systems. This paper presents a novel approach to designing adaptive gesture recognition systems that can accommodate varying levels of motor ability. We introduce a machine learning-based framework that incorporates kinematic and kinetic features to recognize gestures, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a user study involving participants with cerebral palsy. Our results show improved recognition accuracy and reduced fatigue compared to traditional gesture recognition systems.
