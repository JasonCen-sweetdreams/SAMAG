Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network, 'HAT', which detects anomalies in time series data while providing explainable results. HAT leverages a hierarchical structure to capture both local and global patterns, and attention mechanisms to highlight the most relevant features contributing to the anomaly score. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAT in detecting anomalies and providing interpretable explanations.
