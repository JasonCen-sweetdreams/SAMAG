This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems by incorporating adaptive social learning. We propose a framework, 'AdaptLearn', that enables agents to learn from each other's experiences and adjust their behavior in response to changing task requirements. Our approach leverages a decentralized, graph-based learning mechanism that facilitates the diffusion of knowledge across agents. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptLearn improves task allocation efficiency by up to 30% compared to traditional, centralized approaches, while also enhancing system robustness and adaptability in dynamic environments.
