As virtual reality (VR) technology advances, designing intuitive and natural interfaces becomes crucial for an immersive user experience. This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in VR, where users' bodily gestures influence their cognitive processes. We propose a novel gestural interface, 'EmboVR', which leverages machine learning-based gesture recognition to enhance user engagement and reduce cognitive load. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that EmboVR improves task performance and user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. Our findings have implications for the design of future VR systems that incorporate embodied cognition principles.
