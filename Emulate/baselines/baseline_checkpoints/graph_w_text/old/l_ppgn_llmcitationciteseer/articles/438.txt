With the increasing adoption of AI in healthcare, there is a growing need for transparent and interpretable models. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) for text classification in healthcare, which leverages both local and global attention mechanisms to identify salient features in clinical text data. Our approach enables explainable predictions by generating attention weights that highlight relevant terms and phrases. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset of clinical notes demonstrate that our HAN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy while providing valuable insights into the decision-making process.
