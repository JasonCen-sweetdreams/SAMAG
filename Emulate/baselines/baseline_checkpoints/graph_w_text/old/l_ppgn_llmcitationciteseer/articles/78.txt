This paper presents a novel approach to intention recognition in human-computer interaction using gaze-based features. We propose a deep learning framework that combines convolutional neural networks with recurrent neural networks to classify user intentions from eye movement patterns. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 92.5% on a dataset of 50 participants performing various tasks, outperforming existing methods that rely on manual feature engineering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing user experience through a prototype system that adapts to user intentions in real-time.
