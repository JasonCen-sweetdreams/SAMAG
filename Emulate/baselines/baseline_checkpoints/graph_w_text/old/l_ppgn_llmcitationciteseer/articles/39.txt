This paper presents a novel heterogeneous multi-agent system (HMAS) for real-time traffic signal control. The proposed HMAS consists of autonomous agents with different functionalities, such as traffic monitoring, signal control, and optimization. We develop a decentralized coordination mechanism that enables agents to share information and adapt to dynamic traffic conditions. Our experimental results show that the HMAS approach outperforms traditional centralized control methods in reducing congestion and decreasing travel times. We also evaluate the scalability and robustness of our approach using a simulation framework.
