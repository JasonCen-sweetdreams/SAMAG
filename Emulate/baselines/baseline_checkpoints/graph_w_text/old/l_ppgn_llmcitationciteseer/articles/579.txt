In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). Our method, called Agents-DCOP, leverages the strengths of both DCOP and multi-agent systems to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark problems demonstrate that Agents-DCOP outperforms existing decentralized methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. We also provide a thorough analysis of the communication overhead and scalability of our approach.
