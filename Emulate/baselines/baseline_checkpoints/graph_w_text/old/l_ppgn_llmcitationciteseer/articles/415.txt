Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale data. However, efficient indexing for multi-dimensional range queries remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'DRIVE', which leverages a combination of Bloom filters and space-filling curves to accelerate query processing. We demonstrate that DRIVE achieves significant performance improvements over existing indexing methods, particularly for high-dimensional datasets. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing its applicability in various data-intensive applications.
