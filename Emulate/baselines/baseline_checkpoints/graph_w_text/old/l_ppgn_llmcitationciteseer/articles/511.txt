Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to select the optimal query plan based on the system's performance metrics. Our proposed algorithm, 'RL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan and adapts to changing system conditions. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that RL-QO outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
