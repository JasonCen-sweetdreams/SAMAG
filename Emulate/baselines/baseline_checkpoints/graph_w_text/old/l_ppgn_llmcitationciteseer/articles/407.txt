Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed environments. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database's workload, system configuration, and query characteristics. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers, reducing query latency by up to 30% and improving throughput by 25%. We also explore the applicability of our approach to various database systems and query types.
