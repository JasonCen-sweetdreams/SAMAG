Traffic signal control is a complex problem that requires coordinating multiple autonomous agents to optimize traffic flow. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to train agents to make decentralized decisions. Our method, called 'TrafficAdapt', uses a multi-agent Q-network to learn cooperative strategies that adapt to changing traffic conditions. We evaluate TrafficAdapt in a simulated environment and demonstrate improved traffic efficiency and reduced congestion compared to traditional signal control methods. The results have significant implications for developing intelligent transportation systems.
