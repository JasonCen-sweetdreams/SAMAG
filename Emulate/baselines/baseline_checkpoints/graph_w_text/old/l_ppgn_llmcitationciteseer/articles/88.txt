The cold start problem in search engines refers to the challenge of ranking documents for novel queries without sufficient user interaction data. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based document ranking approach, 'ColdRank', which leverages semantic representations of queries and documents to alleviate the cold start problem. ColdRank incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture complex contextual relationships between query terms and document contents. Experiments on a large-scale search engine dataset demonstrate that ColdRank significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both ranking accuracy and computational efficiency.
