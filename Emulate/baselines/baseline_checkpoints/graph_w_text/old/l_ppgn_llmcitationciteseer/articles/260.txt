Effective task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and expertise need to collaborate to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'AdaComm', that enables agents to adaptively communicate and allocate tasks based on their individual strengths and weaknesses. By learning from experience, agents in AdaComm can optimize task assignments, reduce communication overhead, and improve overall system performance. We evaluate AdaComm in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication costs compared to traditional, rule-based allocation methods.
