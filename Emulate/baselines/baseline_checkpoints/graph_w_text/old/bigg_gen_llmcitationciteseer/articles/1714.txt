Automated anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promise, they often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) for time-series anomaly detection, which incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to identify salient features and contextual relationships. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing visual explanations for detected anomalies.
