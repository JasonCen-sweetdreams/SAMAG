Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained increasing attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework for ERS, which leverages the power of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to generate personalized explanations for users. Our approach learns to represent users and items as hierarchical graph structures, enabling the model to capture complex relationships between entities. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
