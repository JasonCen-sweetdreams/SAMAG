Traditional retrieval models in search engines often struggle with balancing relevance and efficiency. This paper proposes a hybrid retrieval model, 'HRM', that combines the strengths of sparse and dense retrieval techniques. HRM leverages a sparse term-frequency representation for efficient filtering and a dense neural ranking model for accurate relevance scoring. We introduce a novel late-fusion approach that adaptively weighs the contributions of both components based on the query context. Experimenting with the TREC Deep Learning Track dataset, we show that HRM outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both NDCG@10 and query processing time.
