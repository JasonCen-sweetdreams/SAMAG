Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR environments. We conducted a controlled study with 120 participants, using a novel avatar creation system that incorporates facial recognition, body tracking, and machine learning-based persona modeling. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibit increased emotional investment, social presence, and overall engagement in VR experiences. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR-based applications in education, therapy, and entertainment.
