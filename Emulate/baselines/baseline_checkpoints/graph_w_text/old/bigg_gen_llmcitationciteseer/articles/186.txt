In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to heterogeneous agent capabilities and dynamic task environments. Our approach, called 'RL-TA', uses a novel combination of graph neural networks and deep Q-networks to learn task-agent affinity matrices and optimal assignment policies. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-TA outperforms traditional auction-based methods and centralized optimization approaches in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system scalability.
