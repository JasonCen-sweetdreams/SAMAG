This paper presents a novel approach to query graph optimization for document retrieval, leveraging neural networks to learn effective query representations. Our proposed model, NeuralQueryOpt, incorporates a graph attention mechanism to capture complex query-document relationships and a reinforcement learning framework to optimize query performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art query optimization methods.
