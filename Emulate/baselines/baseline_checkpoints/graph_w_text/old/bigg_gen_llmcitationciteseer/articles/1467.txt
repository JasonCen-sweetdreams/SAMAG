Autonomous traffic management is a complex task that requires coordinating multiple agents to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for multi-agent systems, where each agent learns to make decisions based on local observations and communicates with a central controller to achieve global optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated urban traffic network, showing significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional traffic light control methods.
