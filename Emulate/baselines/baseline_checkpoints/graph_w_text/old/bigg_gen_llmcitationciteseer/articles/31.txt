Short text documents, such as tweets and product reviews, pose significant challenges for information retrieval systems due to their brevity and sparsity. Query expansion techniques can improve retrieval performance by incorporating relevant context and semantics. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'TEQA', which leverages a combination of term co-occurrence analysis and word embeddings to identify high-quality expansion terms. Experimental results on several short text benchmarks demonstrate that TEQA outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall.
