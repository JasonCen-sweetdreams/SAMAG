Explosive growth in digital data necessitates efficient information retrieval (IR) systems. This paper presents a novel approach to real-time document filtering using hierarchical neural query expansion (HNQE). Our method leverages a deep neural network to learn a hierarchical representation of query terms, which are then used to expand the initial query. We evaluate HNQE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and latency compared to traditional query expansion techniques. Furthermore, we develop an optimized indexing strategy to facilitate real-time filtering, making HNQE a viable solution for large-scale IR applications.
