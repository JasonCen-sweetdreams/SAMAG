Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay between data distribution, query patterns, and system resources. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based approach to query optimization, which learns to adaptively select optimal query plans based on feedback from the system. Our approach, called GraphQOpt, leverages a deep Q-network to explore the vast space of possible query plans and converges to near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphQOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency.
