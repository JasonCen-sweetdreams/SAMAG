Autonomous agents operating in decentralized environments require robust trust management mechanisms to ensure secure and efficient interactions. This paper proposes a novel decentralized trust management framework, 'BlockTrust', which leverages blockchain technology and reinforcement learning to enable autonomous agents to establish trust relationships dynamically. BlockTrust utilizes a decentralized reputation system to store and update agent interactions, and a reinforcement learning-based trust model to predict the trustworthiness of agents. Experimental results demonstrate that BlockTrust improves the overall system trust and reduces the number of malicious interactions compared to traditional centralized trust management approaches.
