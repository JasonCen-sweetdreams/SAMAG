Despite recent advances in multi-agent systems, understanding the decision-making processes of autonomous agents remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAN) framework, designed to facilitate explainable cooperation among multiple agents. HGAN integrates graph attention mechanisms to model complex agent interactions and hierarchical abstraction to capture high-level task structures. We evaluate HGAN on a series of multi-agent cooperation tasks, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability compared to existing methods. Our approach has implications for real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicle coordination and smart city management.
