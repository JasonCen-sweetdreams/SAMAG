Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in modern data management, but optimizing query processing remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select the most efficient query execution plans. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal plan based on the database's workload and system dynamics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
