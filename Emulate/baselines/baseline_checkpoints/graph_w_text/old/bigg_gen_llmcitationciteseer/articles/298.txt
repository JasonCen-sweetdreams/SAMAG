Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their conversational interfaces often exclude users with disabilities. This paper investigates the effectiveness of tailored conversational strategies for improving the accessibility of voice assistants. We conducted a user study with 30 participants with disabilities, exploring the impact of adaptive response generation, explicit error handling, and personalized feedback on user experience and task completion. Our results show that these strategies significantly enhance user engagement, trust, and overall satisfaction. We provide guidelines for designers and developers to create more inclusive voice assistants that cater to diverse user needs.
