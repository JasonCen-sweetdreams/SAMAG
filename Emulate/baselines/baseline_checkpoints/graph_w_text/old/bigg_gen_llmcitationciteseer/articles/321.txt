Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in many applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects and explains anomalies in multivariate time series data. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to model complex temporal relationships and identify relevant features contributing to anomalies. We evaluate HAN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and explainability. Additionally, we provide a visual analytics framework to facilitate human-in-the-loop anomaly diagnosis.
