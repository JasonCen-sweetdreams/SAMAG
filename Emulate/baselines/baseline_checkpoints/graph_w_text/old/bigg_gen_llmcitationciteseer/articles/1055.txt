Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph structures and the need to minimize communication costs. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based approach for efficient query optimization in distributed graph databases. Our method, called GraphRL, learns to select optimal query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query performance. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
