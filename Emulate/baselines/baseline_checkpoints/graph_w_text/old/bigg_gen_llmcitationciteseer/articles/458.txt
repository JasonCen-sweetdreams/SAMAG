Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, as graph sizes continue to grow, query optimization techniques struggle to maintain performance. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'GraphIndex', which leverages a combination of graph decomposition and hierarchical indexing to accelerate query processing. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that adaptively selects the most effective indexing strategy based on query patterns and graph structure. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time.
