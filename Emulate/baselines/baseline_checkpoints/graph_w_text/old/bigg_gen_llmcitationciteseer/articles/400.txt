State-of-the-art neural ranking models (NRMs) have significantly improved the accuracy of document retrieval systems. However, their computational complexity and memory requirements often hinder their deployment in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical NRM architecture, 'HiRank', which leverages a multi-level representation of documents to reduce the computational cost of ranking while maintaining retrieval accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating that HiRank outperforms existing NRMs in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.
