Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. One popular approach to improve retrieval performance is query expansion, which involves adding relevant terms to the original query. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network-based approach for query expansion, dubbed 'DeepExpand'. Our model leverages a combination of word embeddings and neural language modeling to identify relevant expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepExpand outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as Rocchio and Robertson-Sp√•rck-Jones, in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
