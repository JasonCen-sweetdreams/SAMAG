Effective task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities must collaborate to achieve complex goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent-agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach, called DAGAT, uses a hierarchical GNN architecture to learn a task allocation policy that minimizes communication overhead and maximizes system utility. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that DAGAT outperforms traditional task allocation algorithms in terms of solution quality and adaptability to dynamic environments.
