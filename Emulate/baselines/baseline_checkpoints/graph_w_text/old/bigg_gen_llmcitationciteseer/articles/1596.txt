Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization in DDS, which models the data distribution and query execution plans as graphs. We develop a set of efficient algorithms for graph-based query optimization, including graph partitioning, subquery optimization, and join ordering. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
