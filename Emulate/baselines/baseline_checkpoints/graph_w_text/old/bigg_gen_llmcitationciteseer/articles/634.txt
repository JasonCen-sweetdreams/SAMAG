This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, called MARL-TA, leverages a decentralized actor-critic framework to learn task allocation policies for individual agents, while taking into account the global system objective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MARL-TA in a variety of simulated scenarios, including packet routing in communication networks and resource allocation in smart grids. Experimental results show that MARL-TA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods and achieves near-optimal system performance in real-time.
