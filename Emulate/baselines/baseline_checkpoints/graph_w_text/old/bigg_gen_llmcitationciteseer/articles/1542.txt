Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'RL-QE', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of expansion terms. Our method learns to balance the trade-off between query representation and term relevance, outperforming traditional methods that rely on static heuristic rules. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
