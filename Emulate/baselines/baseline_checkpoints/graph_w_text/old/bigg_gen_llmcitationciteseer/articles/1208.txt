Multi-tenant database systems (MTDS) have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing query performance for diverse workloads and tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'Aurora', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning to adapt to changing workload patterns and tenant-specific resource constraints. Aurora incorporates a graph-based query representation, a hierarchical optimization strategy, and a feedback loop to refine optimization decisions. Experimental results on a large-scale MTDS prototype demonstrate that Aurora achieves up to 3.5x improvement in query performance and 2x reduction in resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
