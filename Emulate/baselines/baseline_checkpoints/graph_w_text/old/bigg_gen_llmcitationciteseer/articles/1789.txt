Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in large-scale data analytics, but query optimization remains a significant performance bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that adapts to the dynamic database environment and optimizes query execution time. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional rule-based and cost-based optimization techniques.
