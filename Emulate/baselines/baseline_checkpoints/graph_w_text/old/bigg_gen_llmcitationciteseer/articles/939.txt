Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR) due to the complexity of query intent and document ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages the representational power of deep neural networks to learn semantic query-document relationships. Our model learns a dense query representation using a variant of the BERT architecture, and uses this representation to expand the original query with relevant terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion methods, with a maximum increase of 12.5% in mean average precision.
