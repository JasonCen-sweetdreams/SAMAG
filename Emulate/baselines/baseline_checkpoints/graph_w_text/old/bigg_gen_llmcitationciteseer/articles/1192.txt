Decentralized task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish tasks without a central authority. We propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a decentralized task allocation policy. Our method, called GNN-TA, represents the agent-task graph as a dynamic graph and uses GNNs to learn a task allocation strategy that takes into account the agents' capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. Experimental results on a real-world disaster response scenario demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and communication overhead.
