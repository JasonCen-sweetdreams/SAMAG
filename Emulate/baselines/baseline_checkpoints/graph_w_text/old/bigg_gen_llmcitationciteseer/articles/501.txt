Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging problem in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short and ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to generate context-aware expansion terms. Our model, dubbed Query2Vec, learns to represent queries and documents as dense vectors, enabling effective capturing of semantic relationships. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Query2Vec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving improvements of up to 20% in terms of mean average precision.
