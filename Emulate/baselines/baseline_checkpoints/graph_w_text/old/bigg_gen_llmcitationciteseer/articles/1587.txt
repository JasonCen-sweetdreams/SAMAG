As virtual reality (VR) systems become increasingly popular, the need for secure and convenient authentication mechanisms grows. We propose a novel gaze-based implicit authentication approach, 'GazeAuth', which leverages the unique properties of VR head-mounted displays. Our method utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the user's gaze patterns and identify distinctive features that can be used for authentication. We conducted a user study with 30 participants and achieved an equal error rate of 3.2%, outperforming existing implicit authentication methods for VR. GazeAuth offers a promising solution for enhancing the security and usability of VR systems.
