Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) offer a natural framework for modeling complex relationships between diverse entity types. Node classification in HINs is a challenging task due to the heterogeneity and scale of the data. This paper introduces HiGAT, a novel hierarchical graph attention network that leverages both node and edge features to learn rich representations of nodes in HINs. HiGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges at different levels of abstraction, resulting in improved classification performance. Experimental results on real-world HIN datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGAT over state-of-the-art node classification methods.
