Decentralized task allocation for autonomous agents is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies. We model the agent interactions as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn a distributed allocation policy that maximizes system utility. Our approach outperforms traditional methods in simulations with varying agent and task densities, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications such as search and rescue operations or smart transportation systems.
