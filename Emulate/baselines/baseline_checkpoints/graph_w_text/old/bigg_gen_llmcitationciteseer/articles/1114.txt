Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution plans in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query planning. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans in DDS. We design an RL framework that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query characteristics, and system workload. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
