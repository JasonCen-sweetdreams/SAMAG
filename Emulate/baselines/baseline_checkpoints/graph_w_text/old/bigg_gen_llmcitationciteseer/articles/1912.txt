Query optimization is a critical component of relational database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and system scalability. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL) in distributed relational databases. We propose a deep Q-network-based RL framework that learns to optimize query execution plans based on runtime performance feedback. Our approach leverages distributed database features, such as data partitioning and parallel query processing, to improve optimization efficiency. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our RL-based optimizer outperforms traditional cost-based optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
