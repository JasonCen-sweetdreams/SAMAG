Multi-modal recommendation systems leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) have gained popularity, but KG embedding remains a performance bottleneck. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based KG embedding method, 'HATKE', which selectively focuses on relevant entity relationships and modalities. HATKE adaptively aggregates KG information using a hierarchical attention mechanism, allowing for more expressive and context-aware representations. Our experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods.
