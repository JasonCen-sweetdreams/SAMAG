Passage retrieval is a crucial step in open-domain question answering, where the goal is to retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus that answer a given question. In this paper, we propose a novel neural ranking model that incorporates document expansion to improve passage retrieval. Our approach uses a neural retriever to generate a set of relevant documents, which are then expanded using a novel document expansion algorithm that leverages semantic similarities between documents. The expanded document set is then re-ranked using a neural ranker to produce the final list of passages. Our experiments on the MS MARCO dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval models, achieving a 15% improvement in recall@10.
