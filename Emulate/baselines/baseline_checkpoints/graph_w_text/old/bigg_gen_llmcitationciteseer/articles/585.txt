Knowledge graphs have become a crucial component in various applications, but entity disambiguation remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchy-aware Entity Disambiguation (HED), which leverages hierarchical embeddings to capture the complex relationships between entities. Our method consists of two stages: (1) learning hierarchical entity representations and (2) performing entity disambiguation using a graph attention mechanism. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that HED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale knowledge graphs.
