Distributed relational databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management systems. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the most efficient query plan based on the database schema, data statistics, and query workload. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
