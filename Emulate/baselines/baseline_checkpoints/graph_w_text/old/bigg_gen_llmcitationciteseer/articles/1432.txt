Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents given a user query. Query expansion is a crucial step in this process, as it aims to augment the original query with relevant terms to improve retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method using deep reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to selectively add terms to the query based on their expected relevance. Our approach, dubbed 'RL-QE', leverages a neural network to estimate the relevance of candidate terms and uses a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the query expansion process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy.
