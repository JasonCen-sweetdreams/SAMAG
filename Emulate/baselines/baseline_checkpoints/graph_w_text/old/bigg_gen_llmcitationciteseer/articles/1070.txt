Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their lack of emotional intelligence can lead to frustration and exclusion for users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing conversational interfaces that incorporate emotional intelligence, empathy, and affective understanding. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with diverse abilities, exploring the impact of emotional intelligence on user experience and accessibility. Our results show that emotionally intelligent voice assistants can significantly improve user satisfaction, trust, and overall accessibility. We provide design guidelines and recommendations for developing more inclusive and empathetic conversational systems.
