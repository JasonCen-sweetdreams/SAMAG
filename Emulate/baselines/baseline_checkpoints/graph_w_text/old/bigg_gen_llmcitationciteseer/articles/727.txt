As multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need for transparent and interpretable decision-making mechanisms. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in complex multi-agent scenarios. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, while also capturing hierarchical relationships between agents. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management domain demonstrate that our HAN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of decision accuracy and interpretability.
