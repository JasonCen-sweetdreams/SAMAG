Explainable recommender systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide insights into the recommendation process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) for explainable recommender systems. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between users and items, and hierarchical graph encoding to capture high-order dependencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanatory power.
