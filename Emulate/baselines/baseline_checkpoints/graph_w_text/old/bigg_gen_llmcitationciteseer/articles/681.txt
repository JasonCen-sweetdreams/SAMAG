In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'RL-TA', which leverages reinforcement learning to enable autonomous agents to adaptively allocate tasks based on their capabilities and environmental dynamics. We introduce a novel task-embedding mechanism that captures task similarity and complexity, allowing agents to learn effective task allocation strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-TA outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
