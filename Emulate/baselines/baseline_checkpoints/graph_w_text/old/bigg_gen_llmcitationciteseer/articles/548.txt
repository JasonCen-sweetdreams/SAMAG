Few-shot learning (FSL) has made significant progress in recent years, but its performance on real-world image classification tasks remains limited. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical FSL approach, 'HiFi', which leverages both class-level and instance-level semantics to adapt to new classes with limited examples. HiFi employs a meta-learning framework to learn a hierarchical representation that captures both inter-class and intra-class relationships, allowing for more effective knowledge transfer and adaptation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiFi outperforms state-of-the-art FSL methods on real-world image classification tasks.
