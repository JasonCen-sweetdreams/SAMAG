Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. We propose a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization and machine learning-based cost estimation. GraphOpt significantly reduces query latency and improves resource utilization compared to existing optimization techniques. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world social network dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphOpt in reducing query execution time by up to 50%.
