Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems is challenging due to the complex interactions between the graph data and the distributed architecture. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to optimize queries based on the graph structure, query patterns, and system performance metrics. We develop a customized reward function and a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
