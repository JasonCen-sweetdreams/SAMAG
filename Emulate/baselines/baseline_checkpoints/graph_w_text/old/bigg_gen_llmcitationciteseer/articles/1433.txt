Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have garnered significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture for ERS. HGAT leverages the strengths of graph attention networks and hierarchical representations to learn complex user-item relationships. We introduce a novel attention mechanism that adaptively weighs user and item features at multiple granularities, enabling the model to provide personalized explanations for recommendations. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
