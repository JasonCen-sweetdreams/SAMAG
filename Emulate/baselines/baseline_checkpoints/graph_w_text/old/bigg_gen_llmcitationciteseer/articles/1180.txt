Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper presents a novel hierarchical indexing approach that leverages the inherent structure of distributed data to improve query performance. Our approach utilizes a combination of local and global indexing techniques to reduce the number of nodes involved in query processing, resulting in significant reductions in query latency and network overhead. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
