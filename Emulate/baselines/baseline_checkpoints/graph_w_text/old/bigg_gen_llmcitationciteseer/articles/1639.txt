In today's information-rich era, retrieving relevant documents from large-scale heterogeneous information networks (HINs) has become a crucial task. While traditional ranking models excel in homogeneous networks, they often struggle to capture the complex relationships and heterogeneity in HINs. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'HINRank', which leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to efficiently retrieve documents in HINs. Our experiments on a real-world HIN dataset demonstrate that HINRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while also providing interpretable results.
