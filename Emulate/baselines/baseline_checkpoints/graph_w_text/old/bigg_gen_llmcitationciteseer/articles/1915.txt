Skeleton-based human action recognition has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its applicability in various fields such as robotics, healthcare, and surveillance. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages the hierarchical representation of skeletal data to recognize human actions. By incorporating attention mechanisms at multiple scales, HGAT can selectively focus on relevant joints and contextual information, leading to improved recognition performance. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and robustness to noise and occlusion.
