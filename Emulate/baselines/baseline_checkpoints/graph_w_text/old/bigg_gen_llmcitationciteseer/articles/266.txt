This paper presents the design and evaluation of an accessible conversational interface tailored to older adults with cognitive impairments. We employed a participatory design approach, involving 15 older adults with cognitive impairments in the design process. Our interface incorporates several novel features, including simplified language processing, visual cues, and adaptive response generation. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces. Our findings provide insights into the design of conversational interfaces that support older adults with cognitive impairments, enabling more inclusive and accessible interaction with digital technologies.
