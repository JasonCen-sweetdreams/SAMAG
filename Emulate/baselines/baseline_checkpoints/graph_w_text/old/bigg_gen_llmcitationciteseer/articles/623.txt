Individuals with motor impairments often struggle with traditional text entry methods. This paper introduces EyeGazeType, a novel gaze-based text entry system that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to enable efficient and accurate typing. EyeGazeType uses a deep neural network to classify gaze patterns and predict the intended character, achieving an average typing speed of 15 words per minute with an error rate of 5.2%. We conducted a user study with 15 participants with motor impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in typing speed and accuracy compared to existing gaze-based systems.
