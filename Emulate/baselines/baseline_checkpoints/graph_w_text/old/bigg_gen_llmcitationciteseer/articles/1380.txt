Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach leveraging deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between terms. Our method, 'DeepQE', uses a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query representation, term weighting, and expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
