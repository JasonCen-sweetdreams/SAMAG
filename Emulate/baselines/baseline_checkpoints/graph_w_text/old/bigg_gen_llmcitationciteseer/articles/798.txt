In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach, called GTA-GNN, leverages the graph structure of the agent network to learn a distributed task allocation policy. GTA-GNN outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization, particularly in scenarios with varying agent capabilities and dynamic task arrival rates. We evaluate GTA-GNN using simulations on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications such as search and rescue operations.
