Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or underspecified queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our method, dubbed 'RL-QE', learns to select optimal expansion terms by maximizing a reward function that balances retrieval effectiveness and query reformulation complexity. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
