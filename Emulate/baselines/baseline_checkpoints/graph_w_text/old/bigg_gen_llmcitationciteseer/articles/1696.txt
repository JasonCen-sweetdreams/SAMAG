Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have gained popularity, but optimizing query performance for multi-tenancy remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MQOpt', which leverages machine learning-based workload prediction and dynamic resource allocation to minimize query latency and improve resource utilization. We evaluate MQOpt on a real-world DBaaS platform and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
