Entity disambiguation is a critical step in data integration, but existing approaches struggle to scale with large, distributed databases. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to disambiguate entities across multiple databases. Our method, called 'GNN-ED', represents each database as a graph and uses a message-passing mechanism to propagate entity information across graphs. We demonstrate the scalability of GNN-ED on a real-world dataset comprising 100 million entities and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
