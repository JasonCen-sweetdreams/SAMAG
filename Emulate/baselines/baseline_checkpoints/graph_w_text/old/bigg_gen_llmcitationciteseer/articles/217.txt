Deep learning-based object detection systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can compromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel adversarial training framework, 'ROAR', designed to improve the robustness of object detectors in autonomous driving scenarios. ROAR employs a curriculum-based approach, where the model is initially trained on clean data and gradually exposed to increasingly perturbed samples. We demonstrate that ROAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI object detection benchmark, while reducing the success rate of adversarial attacks by 35%. Our approach has significant implications for the development of reliable and secure autonomous vehicle systems.
