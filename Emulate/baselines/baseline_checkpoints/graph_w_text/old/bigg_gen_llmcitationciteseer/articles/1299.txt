Materialized views are a crucial optimization technique in distributed databases, but their maintenance becomes increasingly complex in the presence of continuous data updates. This paper presents a novel incremental maintenance algorithm, 'InView', which leverages a combination of caching, delta-based computation, and parallel processing to minimize the overhead of view maintenance. We theoretically analyze the correctness and efficiency of InView and experimentally demonstrate its superiority over existing approaches on a real-world dataset. Our results show that InView reduces maintenance costs by up to 70% while ensuring consistent view freshness.
