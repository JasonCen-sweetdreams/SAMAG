Retrieving relevant information from heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is a challenging task, particularly when queries are ambiguous or unclear. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion (CAQE) framework that leverages network structural features and semantic relationships to disambiguate queries and improve retrieval efficiency. CAQE integrates a graph attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different types of relationships and entities in the HIN, and incorporates a reinforcement learning-based ranking model to optimize the retrieval process. Experimental results on a large-scale HIN dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CAQE in enhancing retrieval performance and reducing query latency.
