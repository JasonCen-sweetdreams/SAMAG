Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to be assigned tasks to optimize system performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical auction-based mechanism, 'HAMS', that enables efficient and scalable task allocation in decentralized settings. HAMS utilizes a two-level auction framework, where agents bid on tasks at the lower level and a mediator allocates tasks to agents based on a hierarchical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism. We prove that HAMS achieves near-optimal social welfare and is resistant to manipulation by selfish agents. Experimental evaluations on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate the efficacy of HAMS in improving system performance and reducing communication overhead.
