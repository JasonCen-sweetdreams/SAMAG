Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but their design often neglects the needs of users with dyslexia. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces that accommodate users with dyslexia. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with dyslexia, revealing that existing chatbots and voice assistants often exacerbate cognitive load and frustration. We propose a set of design guidelines and principles for creating accessible conversational interfaces, including the use of multimodal input, adaptive font sizes, and error-tolerant language processing. Our evaluation demonstrates that these designs significantly improve user experience and task completion rates for users with dyslexia.
