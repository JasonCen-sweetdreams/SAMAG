Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) are crucial for building trust in AI-driven decision-making. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel graph neural network architecture for ERS. HGAT leverages hierarchical graph attention mechanisms to capture complex item relationships and generate personalized explanations for users. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality, while providing interpretable insights into the recommendation process.
