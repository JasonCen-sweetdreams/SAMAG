Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, where models must learn to generalize from limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical meta-learning framework, 'TaskEMBED', which learns task-aware embeddings that adapt to the underlying task distribution. Our approach leverages a probabilistic task encoder to capture task semantics and a hierarchical meta-learner to learn task-conditioned model parameters. We demonstrate TaskEMBED's effectiveness on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet. Moreover, we show that TaskEMBED's learned embeddings transfer well to new tasks, enabling few-shot adaptation with minimal additional data.
