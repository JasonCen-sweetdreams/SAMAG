Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but the role of personalization in shaping user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the effects of personalized avatars, interaction modalities, and feedback mechanisms on user engagement, cognitive load, and overall satisfaction in VR environments. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly improve user immersion, while adaptive feedback mechanisms reduce cognitive load. We also identify critical factors influencing personalization preferences and provide design recommendations for VR interface developers.
