Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but the role of embodiment in shaping user experience remains unclear. This study explores how embodiment affects user engagement, presence, and cognitive load in VR. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a virtual environment using either a fully embodied or a non-embodied avatar. Our results show that embodied users reported higher levels of presence and engagement, but also exhibited increased cognitive load. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR system design and provide recommendations for enhancing user experience through embodied interaction.
