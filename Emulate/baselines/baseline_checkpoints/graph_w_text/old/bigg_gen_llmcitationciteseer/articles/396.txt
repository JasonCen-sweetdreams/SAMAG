Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information. However, the impact of embodiment on cognitive processes in VR environments remains understudied. This paper presents an empirical study examining the effect of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load in a VR-based learning task. We recruited 30 participants to complete a spatial reasoning task using either gesture-based or controller-based input. Results show that gesture-based interaction reduces cognitive load, as measured by pupillary response and self-reported task difficulty, while improving task performance. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based educational systems, suggesting that embodied interaction can enhance learning outcomes.
