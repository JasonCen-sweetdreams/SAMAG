Graph-based recommendation systems have shown promising results in modeling complex relationships between users and items. However, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying factors driving the recommendations. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both graph-structured and sequential data to generate personalized recommendations. Our approach enables explainable recommendations by identifying influential nodes and edges in the graph and highlighting relevant item attributes. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in improving recommendation accuracy and providing insights into the decision-making process.
