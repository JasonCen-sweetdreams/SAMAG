Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of human emotions. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that can effectively capture the interactions and relationships between different modalities. Our HAN model consists of a feature-level attention mechanism to weight the importance of each modality and a task-level attention mechanism to selectively focus on the relevant emotional cues. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our proposed HAN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal data.
