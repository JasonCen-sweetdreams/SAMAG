Faceted search is a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms, enabling users to navigate and filter search results by relevant attributes. However, extracting high-quality facets from unstructured product data remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, dubbed 'FacetNet', which leverages neural networks to learn semantic representations of product features and automatically identify relevant facets. We demonstrate that FacetNet outperforms state-of-the-art keyword-based and graph-based methods on a large-scale e-commerce dataset, achieving a 25% increase in facet accuracy and a 30% reduction in computational time.
