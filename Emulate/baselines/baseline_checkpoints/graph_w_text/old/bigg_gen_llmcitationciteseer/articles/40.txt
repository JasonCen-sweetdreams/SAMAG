Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent due to the limitations of traditional query expansion techniques. This paper proposes a novel neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuroExpand', which leverages the semantic relationships between queries and documents to generate effective expansion terms. By incorporating a graph attention mechanism, NeuroExpand adaptively weights the importance of context words and identifies relevant synonyms, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval performance. Our experiments on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate the efficacy of NeuroExpand in enhancing recall and precision, particularly for difficult queries.
