Multi-tenancy is a crucial feature of modern Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms, enabling efficient resource sharing among multiple clients. However, query optimization in such environments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MT-Optimizer', which leverages machine learning-based prediction models to identify the most effective query plans for multi-tenant workloads. We introduce a hierarchical query classification approach that considers both tenant-specific and global workload patterns, leading to improved query performance and reduced resource consumption. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate the effectiveness of MT-Optimizer in reducing average query latency by up to 35% compared to traditional optimization techniques.
