Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in large-scale data processing applications, but query optimization remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed databases. Our method, called 'Distributed Query Optimizer' (DQO), learns to predict the optimal join order and indexing strategy based on workload characteristics and system resources. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that DQO outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving up to 30% improvement in query execution time and 25% reduction in resource utilization.
