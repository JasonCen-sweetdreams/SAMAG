Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare and education for older adults, but cognitive load can be a significant barrier to adoption. This study investigates the effectiveness of personalized avatars in reducing cognitive load in VR environments for older adults. We designed and implemented a VR system with customizable avatars and conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+. Results show that participants using personalized avatars exhibited significantly lower cognitive load and improved task performance compared to those using generic avatars. We discuss the implications of these findings for accessible VR design and highlight future research directions.
