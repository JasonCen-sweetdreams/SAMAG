Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to scalable query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the database schema as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn a representation of the query optimization problem. Our approach, dubbed 'GQO', outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimization methods in terms of query response time and resource utilization. We evaluate GQO on a large-scale distributed database benchmark and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling complex queries and dynamic workloads.
