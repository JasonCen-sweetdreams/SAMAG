Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with large document collections. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical document representation framework, called HiDocRep, which leverages both local and global semantic relationships to capture document meaning. We propose a neural architecture that learns to represent documents as hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient retrieval and ranking of relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiDocRep outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving significant improvements in terms of precision, recall, and query latency.
