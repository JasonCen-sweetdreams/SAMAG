Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, query rewriting, and cost-based optimization to minimize query latency. We introduce a hierarchical graph model that captures both structural and semantic properties of the data graph, enabling more accurate cost estimation and better query planning. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
