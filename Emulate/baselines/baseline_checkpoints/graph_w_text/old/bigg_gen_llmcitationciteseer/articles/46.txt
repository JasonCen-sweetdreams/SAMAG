Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a question. Current dense retrieval methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a hierarchical dense retrieval approach, HierDPR, which leverages a two-stage retrieval process to efficiently identify relevant passages. We introduce a novel dense passage encoder that captures both semantic and syntactic features, leading to improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HierDPR achieves a 25% increase in retrieval accuracy while reducing computational costs by 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods.
