Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or underspecified queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'RL-QE', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of expansion terms. By formulating query expansion as a Markov decision process, we train a policy network to iteratively select terms that maximize the expected retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of precision and recall.
