We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for distributed resource allocation in complex systems. Our approach, called 'DecoRAL', enables agents to learn optimal resource allocation strategies in a fully distributed manner, without relying on a centralized controller. DecoRAL combines graph neural networks with multi-agent Q-learning to learn decentralized policies that maximize global rewards. We evaluate DecoRAL on a set of benchmark problems and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving near-optimal resource allocation in real-world applications, such as smart grids and traffic management.
