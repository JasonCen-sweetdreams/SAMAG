Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select optimal query plans based on runtime statistics and feedback from the database. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and resource utilization. We also demonstrate the scalability of our approach on large-scale datasets and complex query workloads.
