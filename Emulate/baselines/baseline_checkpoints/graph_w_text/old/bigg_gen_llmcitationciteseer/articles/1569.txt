Virtual reality (VR) technology has shown promise in stroke rehabilitation, but the lack of personalized avatars may limit patient engagement and motivation. This study investigates the impact of personalized avatars on the effectiveness of VR-based stroke rehabilitation. We designed a VR system that generates avatars tailored to individual patients' physical characteristics, preferences, and abilities. A user study with 30 stroke patients found that personalized avatars significantly improved patient motivation, adherence, and overall rehabilitation outcomes compared to generic avatars. Our results suggest that incorporating personalized avatars into VR-based stroke rehabilitation can lead to more effective and patient-centered care.
