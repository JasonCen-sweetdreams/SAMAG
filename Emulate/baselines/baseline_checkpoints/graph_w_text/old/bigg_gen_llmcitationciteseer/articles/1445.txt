In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, availability, and environmental dynamics. We introduce a decentralized, Q-learning-based framework that enables agents to learn from experience and adjust their task assignments in real-time. Experimental results in a simulated drone surveillance scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates, reduced latency, and enhanced system robustness compared to traditional allocation methods.
