Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed databases. Our method, called QOpt-RL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database state, query workload, and system resources. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that QOpt-RL outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
