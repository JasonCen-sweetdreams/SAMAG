Decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, especially when agents have conflicting goals or limited resources. This paper proposes a novel incentive mechanism that leverages auction theory to allocate tasks efficiently among self-interested agents. Our approach, 'TaskBid', introduces a reputation-based scoring system to encourage truthful bidding and prevent free-riding. We prove that TaskBid converges to a Nash equilibrium and demonstrate its effectiveness in a simulated drone-based surveillance scenario, where agents must cooperate to monitor a dynamic environment.
