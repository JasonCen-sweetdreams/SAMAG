Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in various applications, but error detection remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect errors in conversational interfaces using gaze-based features and deep learning techniques. We collect a large-scale dataset of gaze patterns from users interacting with conversational interfaces and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify errors. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 92.5% in detecting errors, outperforming traditional rule-based methods. We also explore the implications of our approach for improving user experience and accessibility in conversational interfaces.
