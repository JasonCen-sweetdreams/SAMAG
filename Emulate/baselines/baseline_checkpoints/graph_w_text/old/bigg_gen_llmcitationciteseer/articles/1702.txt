Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, but existing methods often rely on shallow lexical features. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'DeepExpan', which leverages deep semantic word embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between terms. We introduce a neural network-based model that learns to integrate syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic knowledge from large-scale language models. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that DeepExpan outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and NDCG@10, particularly for queries with ambiguous or underspecified terms.
