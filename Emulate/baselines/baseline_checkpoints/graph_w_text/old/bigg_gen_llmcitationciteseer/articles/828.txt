Decentralized task allocation is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must coordinate to accomplish complex tasks without a centralized controller. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies. Our method, dubbed 'AgentGNN', represents the agent network as a graph and uses GNNs to learn node representations that capture task dependencies and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that AgentGNN outperforms traditional decentralized allocation methods, achieving higher task completion rates and reduced communication overhead.
