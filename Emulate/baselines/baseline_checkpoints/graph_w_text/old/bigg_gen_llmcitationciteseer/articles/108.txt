Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve search results. Traditional query expansion methods rely on term co-occurrence or semantic similarity, which can be limited by the quality of the underlying term representations. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph-based embedding approach, termed 'HiGE', which captures nuanced semantic relationships between terms and documents. By incorporating both local and global context, HiGE embeddings enable more accurate query expansion and retrieval. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
