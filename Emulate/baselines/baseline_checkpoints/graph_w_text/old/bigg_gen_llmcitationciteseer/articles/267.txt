Current contrastive learning methods for image classification often rely on computationally expensive pairwise similarity calculations and large batch sizes. This paper proposes a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, 'HiCLR', which leverages a novel tree-based data structure to efficiently compute similarity scores. HiCLR learns to encode images at multiple scales, capturing both local and global features. We demonstrate that HiCLR achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while reducing computational costs by up to 50% compared to existing contrastive learning methods.
