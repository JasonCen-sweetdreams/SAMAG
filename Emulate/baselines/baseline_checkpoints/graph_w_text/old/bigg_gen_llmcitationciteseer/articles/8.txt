Real-time data warehousing has become crucial for data-driven decision-making, but optimizing queries in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RL-QOpt', that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize query execution plans. RL-QOpt uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the current system workload, data distribution, and query characteristics. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and reduces resource utilization by 25%. We also show that RL-QOpt adapts effectively to changing workloads and data distributions.
