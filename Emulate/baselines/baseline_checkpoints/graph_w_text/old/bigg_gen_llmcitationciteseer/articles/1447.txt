This study investigates the impact of haptic feedback on cognitive load in virtual reality (VR) interfaces. We designed an experiment where participants performed a series of tasks in a VR environment with and without haptic feedback. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly reduces cognitive load, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and self-reported metrics. We also found that the effectiveness of haptic feedback varies depending on the type of task and individual differences in haptic perception. Our findings have implications for the design of VR interfaces that aim to minimize cognitive load and improve user experience.
