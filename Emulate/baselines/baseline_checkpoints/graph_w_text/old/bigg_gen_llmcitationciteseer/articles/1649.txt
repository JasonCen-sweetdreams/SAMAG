Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular in modern data management systems, but query optimization remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and network topology. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select the most efficient execution plan. We design a deep Q-network that learns to navigate the vast space of possible query plans and converges to near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate a significant reduction in query latency and improvement in system throughput compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
