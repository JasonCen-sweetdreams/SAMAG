Personalization is increasingly used in virtual reality (VR) to provide users with tailored experiences. However, the impact of personalization on user experience remains poorly understood. This study investigates the effects of personalized recommendations on user engagement, satisfaction, and cognitive load in a VR environment. Our results show that personalized experiences lead to increased user engagement and satisfaction, but also higher cognitive load. We also identify individual differences in users' responses to personalization and discuss implications for future VR systems design.
