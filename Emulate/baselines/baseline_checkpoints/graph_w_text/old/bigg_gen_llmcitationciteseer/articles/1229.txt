Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing intuitive interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in VR, where users' bodily experiences influence their perception and understanding of virtual objects. We present a gesture-based interaction design framework that leverages embodied cognition principles to enhance user experience and performance in VR. Our user study demonstrates that the proposed framework improves task completion time, reduces cognitive load, and increases user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. The findings have implications for the design of immersive and engaging VR experiences.
