Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interactions often exclude older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a novel framework, 'EchoCare', which incorporates principles from human-centered design and cognitive psychology to create more inclusive voice assistants. We conducted user studies with 30 older adults to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our approach involves simplifying language processing, using visual and auditory cues, and providing emotional support. A usability evaluation of EchoCare with 20 participants showed significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
