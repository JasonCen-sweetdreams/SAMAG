In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is critical to achieve collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic environments. We propose a novel agent architecture that integrates a task allocator with a reinforcement learning module, enabling agents to learn optimal task assignments through trial and error. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and response time.
