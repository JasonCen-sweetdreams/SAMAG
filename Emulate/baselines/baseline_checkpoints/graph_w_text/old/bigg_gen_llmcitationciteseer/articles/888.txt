This paper explores the application of deep neural networks to query expansion in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to improve the accuracy and efficiency of search engines. We propose a novel architecture, 'DeepExpander', which leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn context-aware query representations. Experimental results on several standard TREC datasets demonstrate that DeepExpander outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and reducing computational overhead by up to 40%. Furthermore, we provide insights into the interpretability of the learned query representations, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms of DeepExpander.
