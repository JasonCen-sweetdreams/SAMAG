Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable recommendations to users. Graph-based models have shown promise in ERS, but often struggle to capture complex relationships between users and items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAN) that learns to attend to relevant user-item interactions at multiple scales. By incorporating attention weights into the graph structure, HGAN provides interpretable explanations for recommended items. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in improving recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
