Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) enables organizations to make timely decisions by analyzing fresh data. However, existing query optimization techniques are inadequate for RTDW due to the dynamic nature of data and workloads. This paper proposes an adaptive query optimization framework, 'AQOR', which leverages machine learning to predict query performance and adapt to changing data distributions. AQOR integrates a cost-based optimizer with a reinforcement learning module that learns from query feedback to minimize latency and improve throughput. Experimental results on a real-world RTDW system demonstrate that AQOR outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
