Adversarial attacks on deep neural networks have raised concerns about their reliability in safety-critical applications. This paper explores the use of graph-based input perturbations to enhance the robustness of neural networks against such attacks. We propose a novel algorithm, GraphPerturb, which perturbs the input data by manipulating the graph structure of the data. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that GraphPerturb outperforms existing methods in improving the robustness of neural networks against white-box and black-box attacks.
