In multi-agent systems, resource allocation is a critical problem, especially in uncertain environments. This paper proposes a novel hybrid negotiation strategy that combines distributed constraint optimization with machine learning-based uncertainty handling. Our approach, 'HNRA', enables agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and negotiate effectively to allocate resources. We evaluate HNRA in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved resource allocation efficiency and reduced uncertainty compared to existing approaches. The results have implications for real-world applications such as disaster response, smart grids, and supply chain management.
