Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraphOpt', which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to accelerate query execution. By modeling query patterns as graphs and exploiting index-based pruning, GraphOpt achieves significant reductions in query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphOpt in improving query performance by up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
