Explainable AI (XAI) has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in recommendation systems where model interpretability is crucial. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) for XAI-driven recommendation systems. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex item relationships and hierarchical structures in user behavior data. We introduce a novel explainability module that generates personalized, visual explanations for recommended items, enhancing user trust and satisfaction. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in terms of recommendation accuracy, diversity, and explainability.
