Virtual reality (VR) technology has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction technique that adapts to individual user behavior, thereby enhancing user engagement in VR environments. Our approach leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user gaze patterns and adjust the interaction modalities in real-time. We conducted a user study with 30 participants and observed significant improvements in user engagement, task performance, and overall user experience. The proposed technique has far-reaching implications for various VR applications, including education, entertainment, and healthcare.
