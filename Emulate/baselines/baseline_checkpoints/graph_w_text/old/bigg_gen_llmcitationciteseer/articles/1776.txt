Explainable recommender systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to the increasing need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that incorporates both item-level and user-level graph embeddings to generate personalized recommendations. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to identify influential items and users in the graph, providing interpretable explanations for the recommended items. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy while providing meaningful explanations.
