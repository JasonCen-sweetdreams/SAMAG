Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is a crucial component in AI-powered question answering systems. However, traditional Euclidean embeddings often struggle to capture complex relationships and structural information in large graphs. This paper proposes a novel KGE approach, 'HyperKG', which leverages hyperbolic manifolds to learn robust and interpretable representations. By exploiting the hierarchical and tree-like structure of knowledge graphs, HyperKG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction and question answering tasks, while requiring fewer model parameters and computational resources.
