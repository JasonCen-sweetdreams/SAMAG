Column-store databases have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics due to their ability to store and query large amounts of data efficiently. However, existing indexing techniques struggle to keep up with the growing scale and velocity of modern data. This paper presents a novel in-memory indexing approach, 'CSI', which leverages a combination of bitmap indexing, compression, and caching to achieve orders-of-magnitude performance improvements for real-time analytics workloads. We evaluate CSI on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating its ability to support sub-second query latencies and high-throughput data ingestion.
