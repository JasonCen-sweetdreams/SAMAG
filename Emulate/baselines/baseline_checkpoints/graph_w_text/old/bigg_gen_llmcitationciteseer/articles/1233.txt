In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and fair assignment of tasks to agents. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages auction-based mechanisms to facilitate autonomous decision-making among agents. Our approach, called 'AuctionAgent', utilizes a novel combination of sealed-bid auctions and distributed constraint optimization to allocate tasks while minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that AuctionAgent outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent satisfaction.
