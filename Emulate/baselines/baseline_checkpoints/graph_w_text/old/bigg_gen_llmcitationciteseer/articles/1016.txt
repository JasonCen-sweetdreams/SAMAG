Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a complex problem due to the exponential growth of possible execution plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal join order and indexing strategy based on the query workload and system performance metrics. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
