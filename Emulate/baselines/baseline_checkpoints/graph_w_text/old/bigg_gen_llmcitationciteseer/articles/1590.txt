Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for storing and processing large amounts of data. However, query performance remains a significant challenge due to the complexities of data distribution and partitioning. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing approach, 'DynaIndex', which dynamically adjusts the index structure based on query patterns and data distribution. Our approach leverages machine learning techniques to predict query hotspots and optimizes index creation accordingly. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate significant improvements in query performance, with an average speedup of 3.5x compared to traditional indexing methods.
