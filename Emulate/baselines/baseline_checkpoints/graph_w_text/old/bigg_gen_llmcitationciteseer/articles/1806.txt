Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including healthcare and finance. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to identify anomalies in multivariate time-series data. Our approach enables the attribution of anomalies to specific features and time intervals, thereby providing explainability. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and AUC-ROC.
