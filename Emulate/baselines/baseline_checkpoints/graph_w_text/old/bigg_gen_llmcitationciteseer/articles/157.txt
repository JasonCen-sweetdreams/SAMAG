As data volumes continue to grow, distributed database systems (DDS) face increasing query performance challenges. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'HybridIX', which integrates traditional B-tree indexing with machine learning-based clustering techniques. By adaptively selecting the most effective indexing strategy for each query, HybridIX achieves significant performance improvements over existing indexing methods. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world DDS deployment demonstrates up to 3x query speedup and 2x storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art indexing schemes.
