Conversational interfaces have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by cognitive load and usability concerns. This study investigates the impact of dialogue system design on cognitive load in older adults. We propose a novel interface framework, 'EASE', which incorporates cognitive load-aware dialogue management and adaptive feedback mechanisms. Our mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults shows that EASE significantly reduces cognitive load and improves user satisfaction compared to traditional conversational interfaces. The findings provide insights for designing inclusive and accessible conversational interfaces for older adults.
