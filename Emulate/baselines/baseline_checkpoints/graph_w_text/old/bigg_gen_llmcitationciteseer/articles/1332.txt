Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the agent interactions as a graph, where each node represents an agent and the edges represent communication links. Our GNN-based approach learns to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, resource constraints, and communication topology. We evaluate our approach on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
