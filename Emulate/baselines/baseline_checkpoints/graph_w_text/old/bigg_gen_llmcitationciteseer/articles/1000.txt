Distributed search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from a massive index. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NQE-DF', which leverages deep learning to improve the effectiveness of document retrieval. Our method adaptively generates expansion terms based on the query context and semantic relationships between terms. Experimental results on a large-scale web dataset demonstrate that NQE-DF outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 25% increase in retrieval precision and a 30% reduction in query latency.
