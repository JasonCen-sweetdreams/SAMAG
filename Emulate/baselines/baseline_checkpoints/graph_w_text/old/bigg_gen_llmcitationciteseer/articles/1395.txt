This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning. We propose a hierarchical architecture where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their individual capabilities and preferences, while ensuring global optimality. Our approach, dubbed 'Decentralized Task Allocation via Reinforcement Learning' (DETA), utilizes a combination of centralized and decentralized learning to adapt to dynamic environments. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that DETA outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
