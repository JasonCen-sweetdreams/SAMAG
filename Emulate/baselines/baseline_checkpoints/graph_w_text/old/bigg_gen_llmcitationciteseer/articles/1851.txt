Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution in such systems remains a complex problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal query plans based on a reward function that balances execution time, resource utilization, and data freshness. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
