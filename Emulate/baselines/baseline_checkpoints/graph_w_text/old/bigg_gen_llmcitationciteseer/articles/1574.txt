Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in autonomous vehicle control, but the lack of interpretability hinders trust and adoption. This paper presents a novel explainability framework, 'RL-Explain', which leverages attention mechanisms and model-agnostic feature importance to provide insights into DRL decision-making. Our approach is evaluated on a realistic autonomous driving simulator, demonstrating improved understanding of policy decisions while maintaining competitive control performance. We further explore the application of RL-Explain in identifying and mitigating bias in DRL policies.
