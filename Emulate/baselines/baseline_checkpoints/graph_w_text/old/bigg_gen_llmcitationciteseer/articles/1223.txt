In this paper, we address the problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have different capabilities and tasks require varying resources. We propose a decentralized approach based on distributed constraint optimization, which allows agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Our method, called DCO-TA, uses a novel constraint propagation algorithm to reduce the search space and improve solution quality. Experimental results on a variety of scenarios demonstrate that DCO-TA outperforms existing centralized and decentralized approaches in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
