Distributed database systems are increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, 'DQOpt', leverages an RL agent to learn an optimal query plan based on the system's workload and resource constraints. We demonstrate that DQOpt outperforms traditional cost-based optimization techniques in terms of query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a realistic database benchmark show that DQOpt achieves an average query latency reduction of 30% compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
