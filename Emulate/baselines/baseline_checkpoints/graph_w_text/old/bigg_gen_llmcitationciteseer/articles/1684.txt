As autonomous agents increasingly interact in smart city environments, resolving conflicts between them becomes crucial for efficient and safe operation. This paper presents 'CACR', a novel conflict resolution mechanism that leverages contextual information to adaptively adjust agent behaviors. By integrating machine learning-based situational awareness with distributed constraint optimization, CACR enables agents to dynamically adjust their goals and plans to minimize conflicts in real-time. Experimental results in a simulated urban traffic scenario demonstrate that CACR reduces congestion by 35% and improves overall system performance by 25% compared to existing conflict resolution methods.
