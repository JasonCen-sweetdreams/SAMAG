In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework, 'GraphALLO', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn agent-agent and agent-task relationships. GraphALLO enables agents to make autonomous decisions based on local observations and communication with neighbors, eliminating the need for a centralized controller. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that GraphALLO outperforms existing decentralized algorithms in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
