Explainable recommendation systems have garnered significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel Attentive Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (AHGNN) framework that models complex item relationships and user preferences. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant graph neighborhoods, enabling interpretable recommendations. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, demonstrating improved recommendation accuracy and enhanced explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
