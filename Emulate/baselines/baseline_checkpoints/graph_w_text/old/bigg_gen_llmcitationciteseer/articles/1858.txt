Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a complex problem, requiring efficient assignment of tasks to agents to optimize system performance. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn task allocation policies. We design a hierarchical DRL framework that considers both local and global rewards, enabling agents to adapt to dynamic environments and learn cooperative strategies. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods, achieving a 25% improvement in task completion rate and a 30% reduction in communication overhead.
