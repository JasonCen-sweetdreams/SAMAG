E-commerce search engines often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval results. This paper presents a neural query expansion framework, QECA, which incorporates contextual information from user interactions and product metadata to refine search queries. Our approach leverages a graph neural network to model semantic relationships between query terms, products, and user preferences. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that QECA significantly improves the relevance and diversity of retrieval results compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
