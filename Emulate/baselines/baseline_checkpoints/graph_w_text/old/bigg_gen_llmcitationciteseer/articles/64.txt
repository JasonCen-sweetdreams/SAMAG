This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the effects of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load and task performance. We designed a VR system that utilizes hand-tracking technology to simulate real-world gestures, and conducted a user study involving 30 participants. Our results show that gesture-based interaction significantly reduces cognitive load and improves task performance compared to traditional controller-based methods. Furthermore, we found that the sense of agency and embodiment in VR is strongly correlated with the level of gesture-based interactivity. Our findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and effective VR interfaces.
