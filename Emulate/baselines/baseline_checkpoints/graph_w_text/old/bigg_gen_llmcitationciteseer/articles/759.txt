Distributed database systems (DDBS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data applications. However, optimizing query execution plans in DDBS remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans in DDBS. Our approach, called QOptRL, learns to select the most efficient query plan based on a reward function that considers both execution time and resource utilization. We evaluate QOptRL on a real-world DDBS benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource efficiency compared to existing optimization techniques.
