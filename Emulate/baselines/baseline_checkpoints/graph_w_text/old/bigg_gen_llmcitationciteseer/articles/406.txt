Multi-label classification (MLC) is a fundamental problem in machine learning, where each instance can be assigned multiple class labels. However, most existing approaches suffer from scalability issues or rely on simplifying assumptions. This paper introduces HGAN, a novel hierarchical graph attention network that addresses these limitations. By modeling label dependencies as a hierarchical graph and incorporating attention mechanisms, HGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while reducing computational complexity. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in real-world applications, including image and text classification.
