Distributed database systems (DDBS) have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution plans in DDBS remains a complex problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to learn efficient query optimization strategies. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that selects the optimal execution plan based on the query workload and system dynamics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Optimizer achieves significant performance improvements compared to traditional optimization techniques, with an average reduction of 30% in query execution time.
