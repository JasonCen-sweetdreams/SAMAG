Hierarchical clustering is a crucial task in image analysis, but its scalability is limited by the curse of dimensionality. We propose a novel approach, 'DeepHier', that leverages deep representation learning to efficiently cluster large-scale image datasets. Our method first learns a compact representation of images using a convolutional neural network, and then applies a hierarchical clustering algorithm to the learned features. We introduce a novel technique, 'cluster-wise feature alignment', to ensure that the learned representations are well-suited for clustering. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepHier outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency.
