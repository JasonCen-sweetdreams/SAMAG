This paper presents a novel holonic agent-based architecture for real-time resource allocation in smart grids. The proposed framework, 'Holonic Grid Manager', leverages autonomous agents to manage distributed energy resources, optimize grid stability, and adapt to changing demand patterns. We introduce a hierarchical agent organization, where holons representing different grid components coordinate their actions to achieve global optimization. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid testbed demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing energy losses, improving grid resilience, and enhancing real-time decision-making.
