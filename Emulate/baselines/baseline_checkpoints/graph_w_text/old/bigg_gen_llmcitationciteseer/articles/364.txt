In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents with varying capabilities and resources. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach, called 'GNN-TA', uses a distributed architecture to enable agents to learn from each other and adapt to changing task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized methods in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization.
