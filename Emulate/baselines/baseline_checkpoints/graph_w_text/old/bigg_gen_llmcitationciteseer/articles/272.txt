Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to disambiguate the user's query intent and improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, DLQE, which leverages deep learning-based document embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and documents. DLQE employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively incorporate relevant documents and their corresponding embeddings, resulting in a more effective and efficient query expansion process. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that DLQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
