Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in node classification tasks, but often struggle to capture complex hierarchical relationships between nodes. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN (HAT-GNN) that leverages multi-scale attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant node neighborhoods at different levels of granularity. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed, and demonstrates improved interpretability through attention visualization.
