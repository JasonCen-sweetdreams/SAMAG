Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it aims to capture the underlying intent behind a user's search query. Traditional methods rely onterm frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) or word embeddings, which often fail to capture the nuances of contextual relationships. This paper proposes a novel context-aware embedding approach, 'ConEx', which integrates query context, entity knowledge, and semantic relationships to generate expanded queries. Our experiments on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, with an average precision gain of 12.5% compared to state-of-the-art methods.
