As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to ensure that VR experiences are accessible and usable by older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 older adults with cognitive impairments, using a novel VR system designed with cognitive accessibility in mind. Our results show that participants were able to complete tasks with higher accuracy and reported increased enjoyment compared to a traditional interface. We also identified key design recommendations for improving cognitive accessibility in VR, including simplified navigation, explicit feedback, and flexible interaction modes.
