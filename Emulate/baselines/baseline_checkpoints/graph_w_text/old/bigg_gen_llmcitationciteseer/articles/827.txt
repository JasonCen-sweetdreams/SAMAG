Traditional ranking models for information retrieval rely on handcrafted features, which often fail to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document ranking framework, 'QNRF', which leverages deep neural networks to learn query-dependent representations of documents. Our approach utilizes a dual-encoder architecture, where the query and document encoders are jointly trained to optimize ranking performance. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QNRF outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models while reducing computational overhead by up to 30%.
