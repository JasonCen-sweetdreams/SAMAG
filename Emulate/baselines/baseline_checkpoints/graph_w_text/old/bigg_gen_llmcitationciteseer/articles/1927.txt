Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing methods rely on simplistic user-item interaction models. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that captures complex relationships between users, items, and contextual features. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant graph components, enabling more accurate and interpretable recommendations. We evaluate HGAT on three real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in recommendation quality and explanation fidelity compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
