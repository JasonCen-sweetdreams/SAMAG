Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to enhance the query representation to better match relevant documents. Traditional QE methods rely on manual feature engineering, which can be suboptimal and time-consuming. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, 'RL-QE', that learns to select the most effective expansion terms for a given query. Our approach leverages the Markov decision process to model the QE task, and a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on several standard TREC collections demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
