Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but users with dysarthria often face difficulties interacting with these systems. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive voice assistants that can better accommodate users with dysarthria. We conducted a user study to identify key challenges and developed a set of design recommendations for improving speech recognition, providing alternative input modalities, and enhancing error handling. We also propose a novel speech processing pipeline that leverages transfer learning and adaptive thresholding to improve recognition accuracy for users with dysarthria. Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in user experience and interaction success rates.
