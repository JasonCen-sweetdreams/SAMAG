Recommender systems face the challenge of handling large-scale user-item interactions and incorporating side information. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages graph attention mechanisms to learn hierarchical representations of users and items. HGAT adapts to varying levels of user engagement and incorporates item metadata through a dual-attention framework. Our experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and scalability, while reducing computational overhead.
