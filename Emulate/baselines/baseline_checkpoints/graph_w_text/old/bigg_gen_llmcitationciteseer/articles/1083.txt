Ranking models are crucial in information retrieval systems, but they often struggle with large document collections. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking framework, 'HiNR', which efficiently filters irrelevant documents using a coarse-to-fine approach. HiNR combines a lightweight neural filter with a fine-grained BERT-based ranker, achieving a significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset show that HiNR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.
