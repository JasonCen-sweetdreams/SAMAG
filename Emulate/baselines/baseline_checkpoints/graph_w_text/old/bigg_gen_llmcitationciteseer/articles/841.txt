We present a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to be assigned to tasks with different requirements. Our method leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn an autonomous task allocation policy, which maximizes the overall system efficiency while minimizing conflicts between agents. We propose a hierarchical architecture that integrates a high-level planning module with a low-level execution module, enabling agents to adapt to changing task requirements and agent availability. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and agent satisfaction compared to traditional optimization-based approaches.
