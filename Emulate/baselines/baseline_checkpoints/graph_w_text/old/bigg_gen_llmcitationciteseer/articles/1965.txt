This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn efficient assignment strategies. Our approach, dubbed 'HetGNN', integrates GNNs with distributed optimization techniques to accommodate varying agent capabilities and task requirements. We evaluate HetGNN on a series of benchmark scenarios, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized allocation methods. The proposed framework has implications for real-world applications such as search and rescue operations, autonomous robotics, and smart city management.
