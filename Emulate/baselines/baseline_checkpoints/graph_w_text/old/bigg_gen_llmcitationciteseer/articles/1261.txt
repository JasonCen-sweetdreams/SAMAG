Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We design a DRL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on execution time and resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x and reducing resource utilization by 30%. We also demonstrate the adaptability of our approach to changing workload patterns and database configurations.
