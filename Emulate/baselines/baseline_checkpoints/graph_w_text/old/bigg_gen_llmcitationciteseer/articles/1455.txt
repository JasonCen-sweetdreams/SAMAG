Explainability and cooperation are crucial in multi-agent systems, especially when agents learn from reinforcement signals. We propose a hierarchical attention network (HAN) to enable agents to focus on relevant teammates and environment features. Our approach integrates a novel attention mechanism with a hierarchical policy architecture, allowing agents to reason about their policies and those of their teammates. Experimental results in a grid-world environment demonstrate that HAN improves both individual and team performance, while providing insights into the decision-making process of each agent.
