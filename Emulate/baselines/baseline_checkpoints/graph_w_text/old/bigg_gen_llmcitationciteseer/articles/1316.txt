In multi-agent systems, coordinated exploration is crucial for efficient task allocation and completion. This paper presents a novel graph-based planning approach that enables agents to jointly explore an unknown environment while minimizing overlaps and collisions. Our method, called GraphCoEx, represents the environment as a graph and employs a decentralized planning strategy that iteratively updates each agent's exploration plan based on the current state of the graph. We evaluate GraphCoEx in a simulated warehouse environment and demonstrate improved exploration efficiency and reduced collisions compared to existing decentralized exploration methods.
