In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. We design a GNN-based algorithm that learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a graph, and predicts optimal task assignments based on their relationships. Our approach leverages both local and global information to adapt to dynamic environments and handle constraints. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
