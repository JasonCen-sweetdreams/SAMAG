This paper explores the application of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We present a novel VR system that incorporates sensorimotor contingencies to enhance user engagement and learning outcomes. Our user study (N=30) reveals that participants who used gesture-based interactions showed improved retention of spatial knowledge and higher self-reported presence compared to those using traditional controller-based input. We discuss the implications of embodied cognition on VR interface design and its potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction.
