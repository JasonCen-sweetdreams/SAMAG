Accurate query intent identification is crucial for effective information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach, Hierarchical Intent Discovery (HID), which leverages document embeddings to uncover latent query intent patterns. HID employs a hierarchical clustering framework to group semantically similar documents and infer intent clusters. We demonstrate the efficacy of HID on three benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in intent discovery accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our approach enables interpretability of query intent via visualizable embeddings, facilitating enhanced search engine optimization.
