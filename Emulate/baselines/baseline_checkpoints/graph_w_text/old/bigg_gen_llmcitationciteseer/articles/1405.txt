Recommendation systems play a pivotal role in modern e-commerce, but their scalability remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture, which captures complex user-item relationships at multiple scales. By incorporating graph attention mechanisms at both the user and item levels, HGAT effectively aggregates information from neighboring nodes, leading to improved recommendation accuracy and reduced computational overhead. Experimental results on several large-scale datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art models, particularly in cold-start scenarios.
