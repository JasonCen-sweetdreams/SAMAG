The increasing adoption of dense vector representations in information retrieval has led to a surge in query latency and computational overhead. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE', which leverages the structural properties of high-dimensional vector spaces to accelerate retrieval. HQE employs a multi-resolution indexing scheme, combining coarse-grained filtering with fine-grained pruning to reduce the search space. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQE achieves significant speedups over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining retrieval accuracy.
