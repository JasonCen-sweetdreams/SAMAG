Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the ambiguity of patent queries and the complexity of patent documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep learning-based semantic embeddings to capture the nuanced relationships between patent concepts. Our method, called 'Patent2Vec', employs a multi-layer perceptron to learn dense vector representations of patent terms and phrases, which are then used to expand the original query. Experimental results on a large patent dataset show that Patent2Vec outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in retrieval precision and recall.
