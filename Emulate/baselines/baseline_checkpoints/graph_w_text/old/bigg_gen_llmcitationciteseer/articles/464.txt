Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults, but existing interfaces often neglect their needs and abilities. This paper presents a participatory design approach to creating inclusive VR interfaces for older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, resulting in a set of design principles that prioritize accessibility, simplicity, and emotional comfort. We implemented these principles in a VR prototype, which was evaluated in a user study with 20 older adults. Our results show significant improvements in user experience and engagement compared to traditional VR interfaces, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in VR for older adults.
