Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in document retrieval systems, where the goal is to reformulate the original query to retrieve more relevant documents. Traditional QE methods rely on statistical techniques, which often fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based QE approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to learn dense query representations. We demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness to noisy queries.
