Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query performance remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans in DDS. Our RL framework, 'QueryOpt', learns to adapt to dynamic workloads and data distributions by interacting with the DDS environment. We demonstrate that QueryOpt achieves significant performance improvements over traditional query optimization techniques, with an average reduction of 30% in query latency and 25% in resource utilization. Our results show that RL-based query optimization is a promising direction for future DDS research.
