Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. By fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model on a large corpus of query-document pairs, we demonstrate improved retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion techniques. Our experiments on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset show that DeepQE achieves a significant increase in mean average precision and NDCG scores, particularly for difficult queries with limited relevance feedback.
