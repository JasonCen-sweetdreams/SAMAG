Explainable recommendation systems have garnered significant attention in recent years, as they provide transparency into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) model that incorporates graph-based user-item interactions and item attributes to generate personalized recommendations. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to highlight relevant features and relationships, enabling interpretable explanations for the recommended items. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
