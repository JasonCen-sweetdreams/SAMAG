Optimizing query performance in distributed relational databases remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query optimization framework, 'HQO', which leverages a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques to efficiently explore the vast space of possible query plans. HQO integrates a probabilistic cost model with a neural network-based query planner to dynamically adapt to changing workload patterns and system conditions. Experimental evaluations on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that HQO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
