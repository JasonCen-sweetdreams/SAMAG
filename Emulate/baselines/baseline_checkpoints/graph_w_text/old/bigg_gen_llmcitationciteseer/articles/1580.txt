The proliferation of IoT devices has created a need for efficient resource allocation mechanisms that can adapt to dynamic network conditions. This paper proposes a decentralized agent-based framework, 'DARA', which leverages autonomous agents to allocate resources in IoT networks. DARA employs a novel distributed constraint satisfaction problem (DCSP) formulation to model resource allocation, and a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to optimize agent decision-making. Simulation results demonstrate that DARA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of resource utilization, network throughput, and adaptability to changing network conditions.
