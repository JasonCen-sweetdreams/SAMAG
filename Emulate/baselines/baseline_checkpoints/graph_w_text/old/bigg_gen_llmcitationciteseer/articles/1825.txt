As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible voice-based interfaces that cater to older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, 'CogniTalk', tailored to the needs of this demographic. Our study involves a mixed-methods approach, combining user interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify key design requirements. We propose a set of guidelines for designing voice-based interfaces that accommodate cognitive impairments, including simplified dialogue flows, error tolerance, and multimodal feedback. A pilot study with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments demonstrates the effectiveness of CogniTalk in improving user experience and task completion rates.
