Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle with limited query context, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'RL-Expander', which leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically generate effective expansion terms. Our approach learns to balance exploration and exploitation by navigating the query-document graph and adapting to the retrieval environment. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 benchmarks demonstrate that RL-Expander outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving statistically significant improvements in mean average precision and NDCG.
