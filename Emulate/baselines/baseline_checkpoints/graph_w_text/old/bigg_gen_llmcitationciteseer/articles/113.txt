Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed graph databases, as it significantly impacts query performance and scalability. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on rule-based or cost-based approaches, which may not adapt well to dynamic workloads and distributed environments. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to learn optimal query plans for distributed graph databases. We design a customized RL environment that incorporates graph structural features and query patterns, and train an agent to learn optimal query plans through trial and error. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
