This paper introduces HATS (Hierarchical Attention-based Time Series forecasting), a novel deep learning framework that leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to improve both accuracy and explainability in time series forecasting. HATS models the complex dependencies between multiple time series variables by learning a hierarchical representation of attention weights, enabling the identification of key drivers behind forecasting errors. We evaluate HATS on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing meaningful insights into the forecasting process through interpretable attention visualizations.
