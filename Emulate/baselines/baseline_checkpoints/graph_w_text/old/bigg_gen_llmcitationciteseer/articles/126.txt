Traditional indexing techniques in information retrieval systems often struggle to balance query latency and indexing overhead. This paper introduces Elastic Retrieval, a novel query-adaptive indexing framework that dynamically adjusts the index granularity based on query patterns and workload. Our approach leverages a hierarchical index structure and a query-driven optimization strategy to minimize indexing overhead while maintaining efficient query processing. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Elastic Retrieval achieves significant reductions in query latency and indexing overhead compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
