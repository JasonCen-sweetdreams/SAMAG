Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can mislead the model by adding imperceptible perturbations to the input data. This paper proposes a novel defense mechanism, 'Hierarchical Graph Defense' (HGD), which leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to detect and correct adversarial perturbations. HGD hierarchically represents the input data as a graph, enabling the model to capture complex relationships between features. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGD outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods in terms of robustness and accuracy, while also providing insights into the interpretability of the defense mechanism.
