In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, leveraging multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'AgentTA', utilizes a hybrid architecture combining graph neural networks and deep Q-networks to learn cooperative policies for task assignment. We demonstrate AgentTA's effectiveness in a simulated environment, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to centralized allocation methods. The proposed framework has potential applications in autonomous robots, smart cities, and IoT systems.
