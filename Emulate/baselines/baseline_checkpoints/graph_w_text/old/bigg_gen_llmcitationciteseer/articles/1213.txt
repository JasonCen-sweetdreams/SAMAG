Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework, 'AccessibleVR', which incorporates haptic and audio feedback to enable visually impaired users to interact with virtual environments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that AccessibleVR significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our results inform the design of inclusive VR systems that can be used by a broader range of users.
