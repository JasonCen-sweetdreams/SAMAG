Augmented reality (AR) has transformed the way humans interact with digital information. However, the design of AR interfaces often neglects the embodied aspects of human cognition. This paper presents a study on gesture-based interaction in AR, exploring how users' bodily experiences influence their understanding of virtual objects. We developed a novel AR platform that incorporates gesture recognition and haptic feedback, and conducted a user study to investigate the effects of embodied cognition on task performance and user experience. Our results show that users who employed gestures that mimicked real-world actions performed better and reported higher engagement and presence in the virtual environment.
