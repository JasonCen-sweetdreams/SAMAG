Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources to meet dynamic workload demands. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'CloudOpt', which uses a hybrid DQN-DDPG architecture to optimize resource allocation in cloud data centers. CloudOpt incorporates domain knowledge-based state and action representations, enabling the agent to learn effective policies for allocating CPU, memory, and storage resources. Our experiments on a real-world cloud workload dataset demonstrate that CloudOpt outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of resource utilization, request latency, and energy efficiency.
