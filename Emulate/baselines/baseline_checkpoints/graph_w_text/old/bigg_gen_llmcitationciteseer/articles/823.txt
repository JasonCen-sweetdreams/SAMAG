Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face significant challenges in terms of query performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel dynamic indexing approach, 'DIR-DynIx', which adaptively reconfigures the index structure based on query patterns and data distributions. Our approach leverages a probabilistic model to predict query frequencies and selectively apply indexing techniques to high-impact regions of the data space. Experimental results on a large-scale DIR testbed demonstrate that DIR-DynIx achieves up to 35% improvement in query response time and 20% reduction in index maintenance overhead compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods.
