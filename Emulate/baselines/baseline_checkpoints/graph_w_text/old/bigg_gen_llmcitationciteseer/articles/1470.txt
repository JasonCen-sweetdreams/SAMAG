Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in decentralized settings where agents have limited communication and incomplete information. This paper proposes a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning, where agents learn to allocate tasks by interacting with their environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. We introduce a new algorithm, 'Dec-TARL', which leverages multi-agent Q-learning and graph neural networks to learn effective task allocation strategies. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of Dec-TARL compared to state-of-the-art decentralized task allocation methods.
