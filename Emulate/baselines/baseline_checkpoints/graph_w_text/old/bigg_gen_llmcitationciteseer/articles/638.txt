Traditional inverted indexing techniques suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large document collections. This paper proposes a novel approach to document retrieval using deep neural networks for hierarchical indexing. We introduce a hierarchical indexing framework, 'DeepIndex', which leverages the capabilities of transformer-based models to learn semantic representations of documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that DeepIndex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and accuracy, while requiring significantly less storage.
