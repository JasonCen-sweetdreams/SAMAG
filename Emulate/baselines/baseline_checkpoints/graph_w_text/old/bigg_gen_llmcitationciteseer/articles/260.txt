Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, most existing approaches lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explainability. HAN consists of a multi-scale attention mechanism that focuses on relevant segments of the time-series data, enabling the identification of anomaly patterns. We evaluate HAN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and explainability.
