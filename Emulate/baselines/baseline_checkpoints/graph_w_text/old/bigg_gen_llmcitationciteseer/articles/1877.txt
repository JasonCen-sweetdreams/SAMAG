In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'GraphTask', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task assignments in a distributed manner. Each agent maintains a local GNN model that aggregates information from neighboring agents and adapts to changing task requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphTask in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, outperforming traditional centralized and decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
