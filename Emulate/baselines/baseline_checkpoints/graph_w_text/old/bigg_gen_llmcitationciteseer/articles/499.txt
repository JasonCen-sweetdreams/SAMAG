As the global population ages, it is essential to design conversational interfaces that are accessible and usable for older adults. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing conversational interfaces that accommodate the cognitive, sensory, and motor abilities of older adults. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults to identify key design requirements and developed a set of guidelines for designing accessible conversational interfaces. Our evaluation study with 30 older adults showed that the designed interface improved engagement, comprehension, and overall user experience.
