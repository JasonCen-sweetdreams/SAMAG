Multi-agent systems require efficient task allocation to achieve optimal performance. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'AgentTA', which enables autonomous task allocation in dynamic environments. AgentTA uses a hierarchical architecture to learn both high-level task assignment and low-level action execution policies. We evaluate AgentTA on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional optimization-based approaches. Our framework has potential applications in real-world domains such as disaster response, autonomous vehicles, and smart manufacturing.
