Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but its effects on user experience are not yet fully understood. This study investigates the role of embodied cognition in VR, examining how users' bodily experiences influence their perception of virtual objects and environments. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR platform to manipulate levels of embodiment and cognitive load. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly enhances user engagement, memory recall, and spatial awareness in VR, with implications for the design of more effective and intuitive VR interfaces.
