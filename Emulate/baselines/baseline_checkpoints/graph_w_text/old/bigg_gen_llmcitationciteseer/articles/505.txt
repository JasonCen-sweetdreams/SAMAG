Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task in AI systems. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of each modality to improve recognition accuracy. Our HAN architecture consists of modality-specific attention modules that learn to focus on salient features within each input type. A higher-level fusion module then combines the outputs from each modality to produce a unified emotional state representation. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 12.3%.
