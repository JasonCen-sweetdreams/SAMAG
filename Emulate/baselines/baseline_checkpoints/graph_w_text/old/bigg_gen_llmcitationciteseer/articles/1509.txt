E-commerce search engines often struggle to retrieve relevant results due to the complexity of user queries and the vast number of product offerings. This paper proposes a novel approach to query reformulation using Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs). Our model learns to represent queries as graphs, capturing semantic relationships between entities and concepts. We demonstrate that HGNNs can effectively incorporate domain knowledge and generate more accurate and diverse reformulations, leading to significant improvements in search engine performance. Experiments on a large-scale e-commerce dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recall, precision, and user satisfaction.
