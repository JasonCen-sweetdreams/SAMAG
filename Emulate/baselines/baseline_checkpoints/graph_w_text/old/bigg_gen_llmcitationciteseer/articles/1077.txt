Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data centers, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a customized reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize queries based on the system's workload and data distribution. The framework uses a combination of exploration-exploitation strategies and a reward function that balances query latency and system resource utilization. Our experimental results on a realistic dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
