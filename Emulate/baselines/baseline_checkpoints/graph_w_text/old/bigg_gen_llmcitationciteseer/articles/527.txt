This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous task allocation for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'AgentTA', which enables agents to learn task allocation policies through interactions with their environment and other agents. Our approach leverages a combination of convolutional neural networks and policy gradient methods to optimize task allocation decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentTA outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to dynamic environments.
