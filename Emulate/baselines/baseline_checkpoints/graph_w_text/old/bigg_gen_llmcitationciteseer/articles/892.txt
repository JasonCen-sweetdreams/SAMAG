Search result diversification is crucial for providing users with comprehensive information. However, existing approaches often compromise on relevance or efficiency. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) framework that leverages semantic clustering and contextualized embeddings to generate diverse and relevant results. HQE first identifies key entities and concepts in the initial query, then recursively expands the query scope to incorporate related topics and synonyms. Experimental evaluations on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both novelty and relevance metrics.
