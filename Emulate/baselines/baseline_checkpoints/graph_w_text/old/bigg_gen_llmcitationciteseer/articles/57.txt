In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. Our approach, dubbed 'TRL-MA', leverages a deep Q-network to enable agents to learn optimal task assignments in a distributed manner. We show that TRL-MA outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized allocation methods in various scenarios, including tasks with varying priorities and agent capabilities. Experiments on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing task completion times and improving overall system efficiency.
