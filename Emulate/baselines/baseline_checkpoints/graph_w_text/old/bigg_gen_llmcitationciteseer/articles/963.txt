As information retrieval systems face increasing query volumes, efficient retrieval algorithms are crucial for maintaining performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural retrieval approach, 'HiNER', that leverages deep learning to optimize query processing. HiNER learns a hierarchical representation of documents, allowing for fast filtering and pruning of irrelevant documents. We demonstrate that HiNER achieves significant query latency reductions and improved recall compared to state-of-the-art neural retrieval methods on several large-scale datasets.
