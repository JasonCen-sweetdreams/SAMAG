Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education by providing immersive and interactive learning experiences. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR-based learning environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, motivation, and satisfaction compared to those with generic avatars. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR-based learning systems and highlight avenues for future research.
