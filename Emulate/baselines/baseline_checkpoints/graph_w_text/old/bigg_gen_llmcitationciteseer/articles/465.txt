The proliferation of IoT devices has generated vast amounts of real-time data, necessitating efficient and reliable data management systems. However, traditional relational databases struggle to handle the high-volume, high-velocity, and high-variety characteristics of IoT data. This paper presents a novel distributed transaction processing system, called 'RTDTP', which ensures ACID compliance while minimizing latency and improving throughput. RTDTP leverages a combination of log-structured merge-trees and multi-version concurrency control to achieve high performance and fault tolerance. Experimental results demonstrate that RTDTP outperforms existing solutions in handling real-time IoT data workloads.
