Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing systems often overlook the unique needs of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible conversational interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops and usability studies to identify key design principles and guidelines. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and error forgiveness in conversational interfaces. We also developed a prototype system that incorporates these design principles and demonstrates improved usability and accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments.
