Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization, which leverages graph neural networks to model the complex dependencies between query operators and data distributions. Our approach, called GraphQP, learns to predict optimal query plans by minimizing a cost-based objective function. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphQP outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving up to 30% improvement in query execution time.
