Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and query processing. However, efficient query processing remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of indexing and data distribution. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'DRIE', which leverages a combination of hashing and sorting to optimize query performance. We evaluate DRIE on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and throughput compared to existing indexing methods. Our approach is particularly effective for complex queries involving joins and aggregations.
