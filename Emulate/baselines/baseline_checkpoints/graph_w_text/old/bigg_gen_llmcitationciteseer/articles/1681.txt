As Virtual Reality (VR) technology advances, understanding user experience and interaction becomes crucial. This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in VR, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed an experiment to investigate how gestures influence user experience, presence, and performance in VR. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly improves user experience and presence, particularly in tasks requiring spatial awareness and motor skills. We propose a gesture-based interaction framework, 'Embodify', which incorporates cognitive architectures to enhance user experience in VR applications.
