In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to allocate tasks to autonomous agents. We introduce a novel DCOP formulation that captures the agents' capabilities, task dependencies, and communication constraints. Our algorithm, called AgentDCOP, uses a combination of message-passing and local search to find a near-optimal task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that AgentDCOP outperforms centralized optimization methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
