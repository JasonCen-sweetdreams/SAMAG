Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it helps to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem. However, existing methods often rely on heuristics or manual tuning, which can be suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning framework for query expansion, termed RLQE, which learns to select expansion terms that maximize the retrieval performance. Our approach leverages a Markov decision process to model the query expansion process and employs a policy gradient method to optimize the policy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RLQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness.
