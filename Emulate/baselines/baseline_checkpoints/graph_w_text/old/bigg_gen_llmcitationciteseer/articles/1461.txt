This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in decentralized multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and resources need to collaborate to achieve complex goals. We propose a novel approach based on distributed constraint optimization, which enables agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Our algorithm, called DCO-TA, leverages advances in constraint programming and distributed optimization to efficiently allocate tasks while satisfying global constraints. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of DCO-TA in achieving improved task allocation outcomes compared to centralized approaches.
