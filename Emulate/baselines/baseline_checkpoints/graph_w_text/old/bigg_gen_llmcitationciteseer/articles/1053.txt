This paper addresses the decentralized task allocation problem in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have varying capabilities and resources. We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'HRL-TA', that enables agents to learn optimal task allocation strategies in a distributed manner. Our approach leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture, where agents learn to coordinate with each other while adapting to changes in the environment and task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HRL-TA outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization.
