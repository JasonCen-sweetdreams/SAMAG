Query optimization is a crucial component of database management systems, but it becomes increasingly complex in distributed settings. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model query optimization as a graph-based problem. Our method, 'GQN', learns to represent query plans as graphs and uses GNNs to predict optimal execution plans. We evaluate GQN on a range of distributed database systems and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques. Our results show that GQN is particularly effective in handling complex queries with multiple joins and subqueries.
