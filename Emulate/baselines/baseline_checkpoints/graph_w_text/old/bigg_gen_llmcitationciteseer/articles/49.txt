Conversational agents have the potential to improve the lives of older adults, but their complexity and lack of accessibility can create barriers to adoption. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing conversational agents that cater to the needs of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key requirements and preferences for conversational agents. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, clarity, and empathy in agent design. We propose a set of design guidelines and principles for creating accessible conversational agents that can support older adults in their daily lives.
