Recommender systems often rely on complex models that lack transparency, making it challenging to understand their decision-making processes. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for explainable recommendation systems. Our approach incorporates multi-level attention mechanisms to capture both local and global dependencies within user-item graphs. We validate HGAT on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and providing interpretable insights into the model's decision-making process.
