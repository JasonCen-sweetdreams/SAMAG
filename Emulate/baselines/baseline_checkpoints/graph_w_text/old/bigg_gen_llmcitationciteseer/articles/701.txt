Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or under-specified queries. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines traditional query expansion with neural re-ranking to improve retrieval effectiveness. We develop a neural model that learns to re-rank the expanded query terms based on their semantic relevance to the original query, and demonstrate its effectiveness in retrieving relevant documents. Our experiments on several TREC datasets show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a relative improvement of up to 25% in mean average precision.
