Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various information retrieval tasks. However, their effectiveness relies heavily on the quality of the query representation. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based approach for query expansion, which adaptively selects the most informative terms to augment the original query. We formulate query expansion as a Markov Decision Process and train an agent to optimize the retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing query expansion techniques, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
