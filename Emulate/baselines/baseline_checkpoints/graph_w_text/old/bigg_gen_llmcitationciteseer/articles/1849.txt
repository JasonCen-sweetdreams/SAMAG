In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphAgent', that leverages deep graph reinforcement learning to allocate tasks among agents in complex networks. We model the task allocation problem as a graph-based Markov decision process and develop a policy gradient algorithm that learns to optimize task assignments based on agent capabilities and network topology. Experimental results on various network scenarios demonstrate that GraphAgent outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
