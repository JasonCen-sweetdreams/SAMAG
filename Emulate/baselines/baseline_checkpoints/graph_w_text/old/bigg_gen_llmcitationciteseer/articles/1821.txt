As distributed database systems become increasingly prevalent, ensuring transactional consistency across nodes is crucial for maintaining data integrity. This paper presents a novel approach, 'TCC-Scale', which achieves high-throughput and low-latency transactional consistency in distributed databases. Our method leverages a hybrid of optimistic concurrency control and multi-version concurrency control, along with a distributed commit protocol that minimizes network communication. Experimental results on a 32-node cluster demonstrate that TCC-Scale outperforms existing solutions by up to 3.5x in terms of throughput, while maintaining strong consistency guarantees.
