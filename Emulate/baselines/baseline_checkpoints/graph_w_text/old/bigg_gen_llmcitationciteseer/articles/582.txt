Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts performance and scalability. Traditional optimization techniques rely on rule-based or cost-based approaches, which can be inefficient and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select the most efficient execution plan. Our approach utilizes a Markov decision process to model the query optimization problem, and a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
