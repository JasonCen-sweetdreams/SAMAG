Multi-tenant database systems require efficient query optimization to ensure satisfactory performance for all tenants. Existing optimization techniques often rely on heuristics or manual tuning, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query optimization policy. We design a Markov decision process that models the query optimization problem and use deep Q-networks to learn a policy that adapts to varying workload patterns. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and throughput.
