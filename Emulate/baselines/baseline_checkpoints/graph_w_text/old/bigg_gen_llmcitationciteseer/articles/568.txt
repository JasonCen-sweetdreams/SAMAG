Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of join ordering. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for join ordering, which leverages graph neural networks to learn a hierarchical representation of the query graph. Our approach, called GJO, efficiently explores the vast search space of possible join orders and identifies near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that GJO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average reduction of 30% in query execution time.
