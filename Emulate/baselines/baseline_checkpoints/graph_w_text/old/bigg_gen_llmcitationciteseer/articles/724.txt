Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the inaccessibility of current VR systems for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing VR experiences that are accessible to users with visual impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify the key challenges faced by visually impaired users in VR environments and developed a set of guidelines for accessible VR design. We also propose a novel haptic feedback system that enables visually impaired users to navigate and interact with virtual objects in a more intuitive and effective manner.
