In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. However, this problem becomes increasingly complex as the number of agents and tasks grows. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. Our approach represents the agent-task assignment as a graph, where agents and tasks are nodes, and edges represent feasibility and desirability of assignments. We train a GNN to predict optimal assignments based on local agent observations, eliminating the need for centralized coordination. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the scalability and adaptability of our approach.
