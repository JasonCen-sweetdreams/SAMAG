Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial for many applications, but the lack of interpretability in existing models hinders their adoption. We propose Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs), a novel deep learning architecture that detects anomalies while providing explanations for its predictions. HANs employ multi-scale attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant segments of the time series data, enabling the identification of anomalous patterns. Our experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HANs in detecting anomalies and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability.
