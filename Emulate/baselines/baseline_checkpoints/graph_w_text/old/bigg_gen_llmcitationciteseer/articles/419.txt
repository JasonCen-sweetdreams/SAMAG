Few-shot relation extraction is a challenging task, especially when dealing with complex graph-structured data. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages meta-learning to adapt to new relations with limited supervision. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global graph patterns, enabling efficient relation extraction. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.
