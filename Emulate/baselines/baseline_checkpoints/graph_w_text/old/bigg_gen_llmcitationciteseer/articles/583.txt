As voice assistants become ubiquitous, it is essential to ensure their usability for older adults, who may face unique challenges in interacting with these systems. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing conversational interfaces that are more accessible and inclusive for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, exploring their experiences with existing voice assistants and identifying key design recommendations. Our findings highlight the need for more intuitive error handling, personalized feedback, and emotional support in voice assistants. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating more age-friendly conversational interfaces, with implications for improving the overall user experience.
