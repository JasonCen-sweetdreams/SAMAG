Anomaly detection in time-series data is a challenging problem, especially when dealing with complex, high-dimensional data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that not only detects anomalies but also provides interpretable explanations. Our HAN model consists of a hierarchical encoder that captures local and global patterns, and an attention module that highlights the most relevant features contributing to the anomaly score. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and explainability, making it suitable for real-world applications such as predictive maintenance and healthcare monitoring.
