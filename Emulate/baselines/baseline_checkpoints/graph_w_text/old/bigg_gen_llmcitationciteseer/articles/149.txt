We present a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for autonomous agents, leveraging graph-based reinforcement learning to optimize task assignment in complex, dynamic environments. Our method, dubbed 'GraphAgent', represents the agent network as a graph and employs a reinforcement learning framework to learn a policy that adapts to changing task requirements and agent capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphAgent outperforms traditional, centralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time, resource utilization, and system robustness.
