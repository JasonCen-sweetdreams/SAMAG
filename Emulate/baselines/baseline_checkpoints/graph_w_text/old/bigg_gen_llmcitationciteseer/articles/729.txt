Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) to improve the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback and neural document embeddings. Our method, dubbed 'NQE', uses a neural network to learn document representations from a large corpus and then selects expansion terms based on their similarity to the pseudo-relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
