In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve the distributed task allocation problem. We propose a decentralized architecture where each agent learns to represent its local task graph using GNNs, and communicates with neighboring agents to find an optimal task assignment. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
