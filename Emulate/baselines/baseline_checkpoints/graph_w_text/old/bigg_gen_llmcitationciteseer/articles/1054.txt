Real-time traffic management poses significant challenges, particularly in large-scale urban environments. This paper presents a novel agent-based coordination framework, 'TrafficSync', designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize congestion. TrafficSync leverages a hierarchical architecture of autonomous agents, each responsible for managing a specific traffic sector. Agents communicate and negotiate to allocate traffic resources, adapt to changing conditions, and optimize traffic signal control. Our evaluation using real-world traffic data demonstrates that TrafficSync outperforms traditional centralized approaches, achieving a 25% reduction in average travel time and a 30% decrease in congestion.
