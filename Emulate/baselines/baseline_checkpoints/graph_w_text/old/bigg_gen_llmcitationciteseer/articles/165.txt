Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various domains, but users with motor impairments often face significant barriers to accessing VR experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces, focusing on users with motor impairments. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 participants, resulting in the development of six interface design guidelines. We implemented a VR system incorporating these guidelines and evaluated its usability with 20 participants. Results show significant improvements in user experience and task performance compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our findings have implications for the design of inclusive VR systems that can benefit a broader range of users.
