This study investigates the design of accessible gesture-based interfaces for older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to identify common gestures and movement patterns, and developed a novel gesture recognition system that accommodates varying levels of motor ability. Our system utilizes machine learning algorithms to adapt to individual users' gestures and provides real-time feedback to improve user experience. Results show that our system significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems. We also provide design guidelines for accessible gesture-based interfaces that can be applied to various applications, including healthcare and gaming.
