Individuals with motor impairments often face challenges when interacting with gesture recognition systems. This paper presents a novel approach to designing adaptive gesture recognition systems that can accommodate diverse motor abilities. We propose a machine learning-based framework that leverages kinematic data from wearable sensors to personalize gesture recognition models for each individual user. Our approach incorporates a reinforcement learning module that adaptively adjusts the recognition threshold based on user performance, ensuring accurate gesture recognition while minimizing false positives. Results from a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments demonstrate significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction.
