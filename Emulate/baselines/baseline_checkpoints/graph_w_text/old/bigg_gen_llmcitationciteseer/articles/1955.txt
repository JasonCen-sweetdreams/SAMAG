Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval that involves ranking documents based on their relevance to a given query. One key challenge in ad-hoc retrieval is the vocabulary mismatch problem, where the query and relevant documents use different terminology. Query expansion is a popular technique to address this issue by adding related terms to the original query. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network-based approach for query expansion, which leverages the semantic relationships between words in the query and the document collection. Our experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion methods.
