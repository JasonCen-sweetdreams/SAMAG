Ad-hoc retrieval in specialized domains often suffers from vocabulary mismatch and limited domain-specific resources. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Query Expansion (HQE) approach that leverages domain ontology and semantic relationships to generate more effective queries. HQE integrates a novel concept of 'semantic relevance' to filter out noisy expansion terms and adaptively adjusts the expansion scope based on the query context. Experimental results on three specialized domains (biomedicine, law, and computer science) demonstrate that HQE significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
