Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize assistive technology, but current VR interfaces often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces that adapt to individual users' needs. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 participants with visual impairments, identifying key challenges and opportunities for accessible VR interaction. Our proposed framework incorporates audio-based navigation, haptic feedback, and personalized assistance, enabling users to explore and interact with VR environments more effectively. A user study demonstrates significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to existing VR interfaces.
