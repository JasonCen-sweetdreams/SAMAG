Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our HAN architecture consists of a feature extractor, a hierarchical attention module, and a anomaly scorer. The attention weights learned by HAN provide insights into the contribution of different segments and features to the anomaly score. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and F1-score, while offering enhanced explainability.
