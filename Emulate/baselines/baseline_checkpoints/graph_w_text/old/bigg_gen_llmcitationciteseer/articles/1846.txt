Graph pattern matching is a fundamental operation in graph databases, but its computational complexity hinders scalability. This paper presents GraphPulse, a novel GPU-accelerated indexing technique that enables fast and efficient pattern matching on large-scale graphs. By exploiting the parallelism of modern GPUs, GraphPulse achieves a significant speedup over state-of-the-art CPU-based approaches. We evaluate GraphPulse on real-world datasets and demonstrate its ability to handle complex patterns and large graphs, making it a promising solution for various graph-based applications.
