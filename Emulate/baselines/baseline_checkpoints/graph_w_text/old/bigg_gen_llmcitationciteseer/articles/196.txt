Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to perform tasks efficiently. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach represents the agents and tasks as a graph, where GNNs learn to encode the complex dependencies between agents and tasks. We develop a decentralized algorithm that enables agents to communicate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner, ensuring that each task is assigned to the most suitable agent. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing decentralized methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
