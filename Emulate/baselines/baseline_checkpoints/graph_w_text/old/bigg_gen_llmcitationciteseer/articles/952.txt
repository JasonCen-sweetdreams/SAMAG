Distributed databases often rely on manual index selection, which can lead to suboptimal query performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to automatically select indexes based on query patterns and data distributions. We develop a probabilistic cost model that incorporates index selectivity, data locality, and query complexity, and use it to train a neural network that recommends optimal index configurations. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance compared to manual index selection, while reducing storage overhead by 25%.
