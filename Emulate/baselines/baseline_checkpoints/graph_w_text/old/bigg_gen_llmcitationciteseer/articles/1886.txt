Human-robot collaboration (HRC) has the potential to revolutionize industrial and service robotics. However, existing HRC systems struggle to adapt to dynamic environments and human behaviors. This paper presents a novel attention-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables real-time HRC. Our approach uses attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant sensory inputs, allowing the robot to adapt to changing human behaviors and task requirements. We evaluate our approach on a real-world assembly task and demonstrate improved task efficiency and human satisfaction compared to traditional RL methods.
