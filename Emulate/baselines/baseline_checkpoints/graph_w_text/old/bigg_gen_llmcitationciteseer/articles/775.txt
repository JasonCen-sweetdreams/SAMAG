Voice assistants have become an essential part of modern life, but their interfaces often pose challenges for older adults. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop more inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, analyzing their speech patterns, error rates, and recovery strategies when interacting with a popular voice assistant. Our findings highlight the importance of adapting the assistant's language model to accommodate age-related speech changes and providing multimodal feedback for error recovery. We propose a set of design guidelines for developing more accessible and supportive voice assistants, which we evaluate through a usability study with 20 participants.
