Collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems often struggle with scalability and cold start issues. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships. HGAT hierarchically aggregates node representations, enabling efficient learning of high-order dependencies and improved recommendation accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in handling large-scale user-item interactions and providing personalized recommendations.
