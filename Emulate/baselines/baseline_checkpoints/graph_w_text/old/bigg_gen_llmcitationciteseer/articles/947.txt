Explainable AI is crucial in healthcare, where model interpretability can inform critical decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based multi-task learning framework, 'HAT-MTL', which jointly learns disease diagnosis, feature importance, and patient clustering. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to adaptively weight relevant features and patient subgroups, improving model performance and interpretability. Experiments on two real-world healthcare datasets demonstrate that HAT-MTL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in diagnosis accuracy and feature importance attribution, while providing insightful patient subgroup discovery.
