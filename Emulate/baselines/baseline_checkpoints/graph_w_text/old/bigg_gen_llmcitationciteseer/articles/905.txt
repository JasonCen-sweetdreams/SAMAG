Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its accessibility remains a significant concern, particularly for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. We propose a set of guidelines and principles for creating accessible VR interfaces, including audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized assistance. Our user study involving 20 visually impaired participants demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing their VR experience and promoting a sense of inclusion.
