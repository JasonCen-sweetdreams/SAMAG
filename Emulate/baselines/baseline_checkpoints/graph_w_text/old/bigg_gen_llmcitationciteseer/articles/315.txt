Older adults with cognitive impairments face significant barriers when interacting with modern computing systems. This paper presents a novel approach to designing accessible and personalized multimodal interfaces that adapt to the unique needs and abilities of this population. We propose a framework that integrates cognitive assessment, user modeling, and adaptive interface design to create a more inclusive and supportive interaction experience. Our user study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion time, accuracy, and user satisfaction compared to traditional interfaces.
