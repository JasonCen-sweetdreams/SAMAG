This paper addresses the challenge of conflict resolution in multi-agent systems where agents possess incomplete information about each other's preferences and goals. We propose a novel framework, coined 'CRISP', which integrates probabilistic graphical models with distributed constraint satisfaction techniques. CRISP enables agents to reason about each other's uncertainty and negotiate efficient conflict resolution strategies. Experimental results on a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate that CRISP outperforms existing approaches in terms of conflict resolution rate and overall system utility.
