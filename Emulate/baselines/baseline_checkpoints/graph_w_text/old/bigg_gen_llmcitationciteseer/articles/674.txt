Medical information retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture the nuances of medical terminology, leading to suboptimal query results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages context-aware word embeddings to better represent the semantic relationships between medical concepts. Our approach incorporates a graph-based attention mechanism to weigh the importance of contextual information and adaptively expand queries. Experimental results on a large medical dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall compared to existing query expansion techniques.
