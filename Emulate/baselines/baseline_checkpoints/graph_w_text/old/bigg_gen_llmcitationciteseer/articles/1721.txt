Emotion recognition from multi-modal data (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a crucial task in human-computer interaction. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and timestamps to improve emotion recognition accuracy. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers and a hierarchical fusion mechanism, enabling it to capture complex patterns and relationships across modalities. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of weighted F1-score and emotion recognition accuracy, while reducing computational costs by 30%
