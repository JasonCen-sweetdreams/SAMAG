Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical embedding approach, HierPass, which learns to represent passages at multiple granularities. We introduce a document-level embedding that captures the global context, and a sentence-level embedding that focuses on local semantic meaning. Our experiments on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that HierPass achieves state-of-the-art passage retrieval performance, outperforming existing methods by 12.5% in terms of recall@10, while reducing the computational cost by 30%.
