Microblog retrieval poses unique challenges due to the brevity and noisiness of tweets. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to improve retrieval effectiveness. Our method, termed 'TweetExpand', incorporates a neural ranking model to select the most informative terms from the top-ranked tweets. We demonstrate that TweetExpand outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques on several microblog datasets, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
