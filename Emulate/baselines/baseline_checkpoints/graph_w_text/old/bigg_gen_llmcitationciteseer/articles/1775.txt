Main-memory column-stores have gained popularity due to their ability to process massive amounts of data efficiently. However, query optimization remains a critical challenge, particularly when dealing with complex queries. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, dubbed 'ColInx', which leverages the characteristics of main-memory column-stores to accelerate query execution. ColInx employs a hierarchical indexing structure that reduces the number of unnecessary row accesses, resulting in significant performance improvements. Experimental results using a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColInx outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x, while maintaining a low index creation time.
