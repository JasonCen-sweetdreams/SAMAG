Multi-agent systems often require autonomous negotiation strategies to reach mutually beneficial agreements. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to train agents to negotiate effectively in complex, dynamic environments. Our method, called 'DeepNegotiate', uses a multi-agent actor-critic framework to learn negotiation strategies that adapt to changing opponent behaviors and preferences. We evaluate DeepNegotiate in a variety of negotiation scenarios and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional, rule-based negotiation methods. Our results have implications for the development of autonomous systems that can negotiate effectively with humans and other agents in real-world applications.
