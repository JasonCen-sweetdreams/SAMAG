In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel approach to autonomous task allocation using reinforcement learning. We introduce a decentralized framework, 'AgentRL', which enables agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing task requirements. AgentRL integrates a actor-critic architecture with a novel reward function that balances task efficiency and fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentRL outperforms traditional task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion time and agent satisfaction.
