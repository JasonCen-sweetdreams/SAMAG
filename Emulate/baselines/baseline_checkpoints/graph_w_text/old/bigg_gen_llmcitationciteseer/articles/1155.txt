In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using reinforcement learning, where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities and environmental feedback. We introduce a novel reward function that incorporates both task completion and agent usage, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulated environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and system robustness.
