Explainability is a critical aspect of recommendation systems, as users seek to understand the reasoning behind suggested items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that integrates both item-level and user-level graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between users and items. We introduce a novel attention-based explainability module that generates personalized, interpretable explanations for each recommended item. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and providing insightful explanations, outperforming state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models.
