Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their interaction modalities often neglect the needs of visually impaired users. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop a more inclusive voice assistant system. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies with visually impaired participants to inform the design of multimodal feedback mechanisms, including haptic, audio, and tactile cues. Our results show that the proposed system significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the development of more accessible HCI systems.
