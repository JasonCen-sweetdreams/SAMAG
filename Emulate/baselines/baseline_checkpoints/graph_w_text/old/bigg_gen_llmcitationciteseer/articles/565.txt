Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a neural semantic embedding-based approach to query expansion, dubbed 'NeuroExp'. NeuroExp leverages pre-trained language models to generate semantic embeddings for query terms and expands them using a novel attention-based mechanism. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that NeuroExp outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
