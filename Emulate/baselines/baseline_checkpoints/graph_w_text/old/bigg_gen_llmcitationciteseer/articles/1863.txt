Distributed data warehouses have become essential for big data analytics, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColumOpt', which leverages columnar storage to minimize data transfer and processing costs. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that selects the most efficient query plan based on statistical estimates of columnar data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world distributed data warehouse show that ColumOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
