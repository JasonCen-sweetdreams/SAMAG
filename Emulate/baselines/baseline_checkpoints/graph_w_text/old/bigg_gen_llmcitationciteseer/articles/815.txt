Real-time data warehousing has become essential for organizations to support timely decision-making. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel column-store indexing approach, called 'RT-CStore', designed to optimize query performance for real-time data warehousing. RT-CStore leverages a combination of column-store indexing, data partitioning, and caching to reduce query latency. Our experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that RT-CStore outperforms traditional row-store indexing by up to 3x for complex analytical queries, while maintaining similar storage efficiency.
