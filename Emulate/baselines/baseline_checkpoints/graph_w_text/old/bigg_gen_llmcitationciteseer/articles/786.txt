Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, optimizing queries for distributed graph databases remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'DistributedGraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph decomposition, query rewriting, and adaptive caching to minimize query latency and improve throughput. We evaluate DistributedGraphOpt on a large-scale social network dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing query optimization techniques.
