Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data management. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization, which leverages the structural properties of the database schema to identify efficient query execution plans. Our method, dubbed 'GraphQOpt', uses graph neural networks to learn a representation of the database schema and then applies graph-based algorithms to optimize query plans. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphQOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
