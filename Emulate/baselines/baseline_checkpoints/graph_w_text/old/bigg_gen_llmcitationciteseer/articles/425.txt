With the growing adoption of RDF data models in various applications, optimizing query performance for distributed RDF graphs has become a crucial challenge. This paper proposes an adaptive join order selection algorithm for distributed RDF query optimization. Our approach leverages graph partitioning and dynamic statistics to select an optimal join order that minimizes communication costs and execution time. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 35% in terms of query execution time.
