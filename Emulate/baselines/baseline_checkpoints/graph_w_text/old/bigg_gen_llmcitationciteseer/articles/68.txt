Designing voice-based interfaces for elderly users with cognitive impairments is a challenging task due to their varying levels of cognitive decline. This paper presents a novel framework, 'CAREVoice', that integrates cognitive load assessment, personalized dialogue management, and error-tolerant speech recognition to improve the interaction experience for this user group. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that CAREVoice significantly reduced user frustration and improved task completion rates compared to existing voice assistants. Our findings have implications for the design of accessible and usable voice-based interfaces for the aging population.
