This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed an immersive VR system that tracks users' hand movements and maps them to virtual objects. Our user study reveals that embodied interaction enhances cognitive processing, particularly in spatial reasoning and problem-solving tasks. We also investigate the role of agency and ownership in shaping user experience and present a framework for designing more intuitive and effective VR interfaces.
