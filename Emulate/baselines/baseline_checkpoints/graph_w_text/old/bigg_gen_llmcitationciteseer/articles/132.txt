This paper explores the potential of augmented reality (AR) to create inclusive learning environments for students with disabilities. We designed and evaluated an AR-based interactive system that provides personalized learning experiences for students with visual, auditory, and motor impairments. Our study involved 30 participants and showed significant improvements in engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes. We also developed a novel accessibility framework for AR interactions, which provides guidelines for designers and developers to create inclusive AR experiences.
