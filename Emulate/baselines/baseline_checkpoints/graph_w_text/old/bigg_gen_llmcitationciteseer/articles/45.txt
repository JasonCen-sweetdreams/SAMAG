Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal query plans based on graph topology, query patterns, and system workload. Our experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
