Diversifying search results is crucial for providing users with a comprehensive understanding of a topic. Existing methods often rely on computationally expensive pairwise similarity calculations or require extensive feature engineering. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) approach that efficiently retrieves diverse documents by modeling the semantic relationships between them. Our HGNN framework leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture both local and global document similarities, enabling effective diversification of search results. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and diversity.
