Traditional indexing techniques in relational databases often fall short in modern applications, where data is increasingly complex and dynamic. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'FlexIndex', which integrates the benefits of B-tree and graph-based indexing. By leveraging machine learning-based clustering and classification techniques, FlexIndex adaptively reconfigures the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing methods, particularly for complex queries and large-scale datasets.
