Distributed databases have become a cornerstone of modern data management, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'PartiIndex', which leverages data partitioning to reduce query latency. By adaptively partitioning the index based on data distribution and query patterns, PartiIndex minimizes the number of nodes involved in query execution, resulting in significant performance gains. We evaluate PartiIndex on a real-world dataset and demonstrate an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional indexing methods.
