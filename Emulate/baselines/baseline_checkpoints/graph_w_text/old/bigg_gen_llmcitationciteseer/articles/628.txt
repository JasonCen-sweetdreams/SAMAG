Smart city management involves coordinating various agents, such as traffic management systems, energy grids, and waste collection services. This paper proposes a novel distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) approach for coordinating heterogeneous agents in smart cities. We introduce a multi-agent system architecture that leverages DCOP to optimize resource allocation and resolve conflicts between agents. Our approach is evaluated on a realistic simulation of a smart city, demonstrating improved efficiency and scalability compared to traditional centralized optimization methods.
