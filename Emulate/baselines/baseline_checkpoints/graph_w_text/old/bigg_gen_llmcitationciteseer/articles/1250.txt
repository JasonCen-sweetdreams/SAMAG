This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating autonomous agents in smart traffic management systems using hierarchical reinforcement learning. Our proposed method, 'HRTL', leverages a hierarchical framework to decompose the complex task of traffic management into smaller sub-problems, allowing agents to learn and optimize their behavior in a more efficient and scalable manner. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate that HRTL outperforms traditional reinforcement learning methods in terms of reducing congestion and improving traffic flow.
