This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, which leverages distributed reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in real-time. Our approach, called 'Distributed Agent Coordination' (DAC), enables agents to learn from their local interactions and adapt to changing task requirements without relying on a centralized controller. DAC is evaluated through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing approaches. The proposed framework has significant implications for real-world applications, such as autonomous robotic teams and smart grid management.
