With the exponential growth of data, Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) systems face significant challenges in query processing efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach to improve query performance in DIR systems. Our method leverages a combination of term-frequency and document-frequency based indexing to reduce the number of nodes traversed during query processing. Experimental results on a large-scale text dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 30% reduction in query latency and 25% improvement in throughput compared to existing indexing techniques.
