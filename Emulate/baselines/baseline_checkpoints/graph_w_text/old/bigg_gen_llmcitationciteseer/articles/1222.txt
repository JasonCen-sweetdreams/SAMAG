In multi-agent systems, efficient resource utilization is critical to achieving task objectives. This paper proposes a novel framework for dynamic task allocation, 'DyTA', which coordinates agents to adapt to changing task requirements and resource availability. DyTA leverages a decentralized auction-based mechanism to assign tasks to agents, taking into account their capabilities, workload, and communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DyTA through simulations of a disaster response scenario, showcasing improved resource utilization and reduced task completion time compared to existing static allocation methods.
