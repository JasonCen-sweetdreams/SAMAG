Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has seen significant progress with the advent of dense retrieval methods. However, these approaches often suffer from high computational costs and memory requirements. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval framework, 'HiDense', which leverages a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy to efficiently identify relevant passages. Our approach combines a fast, sparse retrieval module with a dense, hierarchical reranking module, achieving a 3x reduction in computation time while maintaining state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy on the Natural Questions dataset.
