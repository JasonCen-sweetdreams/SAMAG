This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed a VR system that tracks users' hand movements and correlates them with cognitive tasks, such as problem-solving and memory recall. Our user study reveals that embodied cognition principles, like gestures influencing thought processes, are prominent in VR. We also find that gesture-based interaction enhances cognitive performance and user experience compared to traditional controllers. The findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and effective VR interfaces, highlighting the potential of embodied cognition in HCI.
