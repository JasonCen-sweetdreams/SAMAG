Distributed column stores have become increasingly popular for large-scale data analytics, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and propose a deep Q-network-based algorithm to learn optimal query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while reducing the number of optimization iterations by a factor of 5.
