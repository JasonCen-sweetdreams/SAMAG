Query expansion is a crucial technique in ad-hoc retrieval to improve the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel reinforced neural ranking model (RNR-QE) that learns to expand queries by optimizing a reward function based on the retrieval performance. RNR-QE utilizes a neural ranking model to generate a set of expanded queries and then selects the best expanded query using a reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results on several standard benchmarks demonstrate that RNR-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of precision, recall, and NDCG.
