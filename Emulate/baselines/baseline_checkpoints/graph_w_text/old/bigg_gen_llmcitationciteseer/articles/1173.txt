The increasing adoption of Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms has led to a surge in multi-tenancy, where multiple customers share the same database infrastructure. However, optimizing query performance in such environments remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel distributed query optimization framework, 'DQO-MT', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and a hierarchical optimization strategy to minimize query latency and improve resource utilization. Our experimental evaluation on a production DBaaS platform shows that DQO-MT achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to existing optimization techniques.
