Accurate time series forecasting is crucial in many applications, but it often involves dealing with uncertainty and noisy data. This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian neural network (H-BNN) framework that explicitly models uncertainty in both the data and the model parameters. We develop a novel uncertainty-aware loss function that incorporates probabilistic estimates of the forecast errors, enabling the model to adapt to changing data patterns and uncertainty levels. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that H-BNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and uncertainty calibration, particularly in the presence of anomalies and concept drift.
