As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to ensure that its benefits are accessible to all, including older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive VR interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel VR interface framework, 'CognitiveCare', which incorporates compensatory strategies, adaptive difficulty levels, and multimodal feedback to enhance usability and accessibility. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
