As multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need for explainable decision-making frameworks. We propose Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN), a novel architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions. HAN learns to generate attention weights that highlight critical agents, their relationships, and the decision-making process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN on a simulated multi-agent environment, showcasing improved explainability and decision quality compared to existing approaches.
