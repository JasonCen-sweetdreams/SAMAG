Voice-based assistants have become ubiquitous, but their effectiveness hinges on understanding user preferences. This study explores the role of personalization in enhancing user experience in voice-based assistants. We conducted a mixed-methods study, involving a large-scale survey and a controlled laboratory experiment, to examine how users respond to personalized and non-personalized voice interactions. Our results show that personalization significantly improves user satisfaction, especially for users with disabilities. We also identify key factors influencing user preferences, including tone, language style, and error tolerance. Our findings inform the design of more inclusive and user-centered voice-based assistants.
