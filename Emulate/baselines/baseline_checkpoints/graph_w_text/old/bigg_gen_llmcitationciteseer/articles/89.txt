Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data. However, optimizing queries in DDS remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and node communication. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GNN-QO', that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the query optimization strategy. We model the DDS as a graph and utilize GNNs to learn the node communication patterns and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world DDS dataset show that GNN-QO outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
