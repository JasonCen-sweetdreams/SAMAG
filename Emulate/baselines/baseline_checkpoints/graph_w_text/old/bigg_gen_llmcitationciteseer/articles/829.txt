Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes two novel techniques, 'Query Fragmentation' and 'Data Replication Aware Reordering', to improve the efficiency of query optimization in distributed database systems. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that these techniques can reduce the average query response time by up to 30% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
