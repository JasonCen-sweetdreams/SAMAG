This paper presents a novel framework for coordinating multi-agent systems to optimize dynamic resource allocation in complex, uncertain environments. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach that integrates actor-critic methods with graph neural networks to learn decentralized policies for agent coordination. The framework is evaluated in a simulated smart grid scenario, demonstrating improved resource allocation efficiency and adaptability to changing demand patterns compared to traditional model-based optimization methods.
