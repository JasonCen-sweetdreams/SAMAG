Entity disambiguation in knowledge graphs is a critical task that involves resolving ambiguity in entity references. Existing approaches rely on shallow models that fail to capture complex semantic relationships between entities. This paper proposes a novel deep ranking model, 'KG-DRM', which leverages graph convolutional networks and attention mechanisms to learn entity representations. Our approach jointly optimizes entity and relation embeddings, enabling KG-DRM to capture nuanced relationships between entities. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-DRM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in entity disambiguation tasks, achieving an average improvement of 12.5% in F1-score.
