Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on hand-tuned rules and heuristics, which may not adapt well to dynamic workload changes. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called QOptRL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given workload, taking into account various factors such as data distribution, network latency, and resource availability. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark show that QOptRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
