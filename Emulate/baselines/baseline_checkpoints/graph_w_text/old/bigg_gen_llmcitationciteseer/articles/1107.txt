Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their accessibility for older adults remains a concern. This paper presents a Wizard-of-Oz study examining the usability and acceptability of a tailored voice assistant for older adults. We recruited 20 participants (ages 65-85) to interact with our prototype, which incorporated age-related design considerations such as simplified language, loudspeaker volume, and visual cues. Results show significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants. We also identify key design implications for future inclusive voice assistant systems, including the need for multimodal feedback and elderly-specific language processing.
