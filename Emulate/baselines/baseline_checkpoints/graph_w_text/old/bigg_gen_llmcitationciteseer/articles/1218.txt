This paper presents a novel auction-based mechanism for coordinated task allocation in multi-agent systems. Our approach, dubbed 'CATS', leverages a combinatorial auction framework to efficiently allocate tasks to agents while minimizing communication overhead and ensuring collective optimality. We introduce a novel bidding strategy that incorporates agent-specific utility functions and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulated task allocation scenarios. Experimental results show that CATS outperforms existing decentralized approaches in terms of solution quality and scalability.
