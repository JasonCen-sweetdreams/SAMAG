Distributed database systems face the challenge of optimizing complex queries across multiple nodes. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, which can be inefficient and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. We design a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to model the query optimization problem and train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
