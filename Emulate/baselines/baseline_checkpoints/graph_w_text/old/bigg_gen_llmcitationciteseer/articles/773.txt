Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in information retrieval, where the goal is to accurately identify the correct entity mention in unstructured text. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'KG-HATT', that leverages knowledge graph embeddings and hierarchical attention mechanisms to disambiguate entities in real-time. We construct a hierarchical attention network that captures contextual relationships between entity mentions and their corresponding knowledge graph entities. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-HATT achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches by 12.5% in terms of accuracy and 30% in terms of inference time.
