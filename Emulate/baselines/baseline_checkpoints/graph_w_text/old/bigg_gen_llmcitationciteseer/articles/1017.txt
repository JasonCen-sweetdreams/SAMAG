Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for businesses to make timely decisions. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DRL-Opt', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for real-time data warehousing. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and utilize a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DRL-Opt outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while maintaining a high degree of accuracy.
