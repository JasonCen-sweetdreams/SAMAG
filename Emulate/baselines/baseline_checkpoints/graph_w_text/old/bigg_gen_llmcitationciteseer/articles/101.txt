Virtual reality (VR) applications often suffer from a lack of tactile feedback, compromising user immersion and task performance. This paper introduces 'HaptaGuide', a novel framework for generating adaptive haptic feedback in VR environments. Our approach leverages machine learning to predict user behavior and adjust the type, intensity, and timing of haptic cues in real-time. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that HaptaGuide significantly improves user satisfaction, reduces errors, and enhances overall VR experience compared to traditional vibrotactile feedback methods.
