Anomaly detection in high-dimensional data is a challenging task due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel deep autoencoder-based approach, 'AnoDAE', which leverages the latent space representation to identify anomalies. We introduce a robust loss function that combines reconstruction error with a regularization term, encouraging the model to learn a compact and informative representation of normal data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AnoDAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to outliers.
