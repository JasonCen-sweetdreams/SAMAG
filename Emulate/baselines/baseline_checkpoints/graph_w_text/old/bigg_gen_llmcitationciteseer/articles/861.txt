Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex data relationships. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the exponential growth of possible query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using machine learning. We develop a graph neural network (GNN) that learns to predict efficient query plans based on graph structure and query patterns. Our experimental evaluation on large-scale graph datasets demonstrates that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
