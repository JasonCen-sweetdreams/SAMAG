This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for autonomous agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'MARA', which enables agents to learn cooperative policies for task allocation in complex, dynamic environments. MARA combines a graph neural network-based communication mechanism with a deep Q-network-based action selection mechanism, allowing agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that MARA outperforms traditional task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and overall system efficiency.
