This paper addresses the challenging problem of decentralized task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'DTRL', which enables agents to learn optimal task assignment policies in a distributed manner. DTRL leverages a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a hierarchical actor-critic architecture to handle complex task dependencies. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that DTRL outperforms traditional distributed constraint optimization methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
