This paper presents an innovative approach to designing emotive avatar-based virtual assistants for e-commerce applications. We propose a multimodal framework that integrates facial expression recognition, sentiment analysis, and natural language processing to create personalized and empathetic interactions between users and virtual agents. Our user study demonstrates that the proposed approach significantly enhances user satisfaction, trust, and loyalty in online shopping experiences. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the development of more human-centered and engaging virtual assistants in various domains.
