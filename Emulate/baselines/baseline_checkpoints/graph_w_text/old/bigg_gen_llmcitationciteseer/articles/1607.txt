This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework for explainable multi-agent decision making in complex, dynamic environments. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents, entities, and context features, enabling the model to generate interpretable decision-making processes. We evaluate our approach on a suite of benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also provide visualizations and case studies to illustrate the benefits of our approach in real-world applications.
