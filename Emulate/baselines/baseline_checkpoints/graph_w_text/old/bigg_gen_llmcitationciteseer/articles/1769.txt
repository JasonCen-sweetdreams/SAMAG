Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and improve query performance. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. Our approach, called QOptRL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan given a set of database statistics and query workload. We evaluate QOptRL on a real-world dataset and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
