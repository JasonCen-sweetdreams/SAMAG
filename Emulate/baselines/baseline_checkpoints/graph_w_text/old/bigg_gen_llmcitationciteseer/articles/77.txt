Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, optimizing queries in large-scale graph databases remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal query plans based on a reward function that balances query execution time and memory usage. Our experimental evaluation on real-world graph datasets demonstrates that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques and scales to large graphs with millions of vertices.
