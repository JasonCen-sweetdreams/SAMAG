In multi-agent systems, cooperation is crucial for achieving complex goals. However, explaining the decision-making process of agents remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces HANCO (Hierarchical Attention Networks for Cooperation), a novel deep learning framework that enables explainable multi-agent cooperation. HANCO leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to model agent interactions, allowing for the identification of key cooperation factors. We evaluate HANCO on a suite of benchmark tasks, demonstrating improved cooperation performance and enhanced interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
