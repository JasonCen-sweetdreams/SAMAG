As data outsourcing to cloud services becomes prevalent, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data is crucial. This paper tackles the problem of efficiently executing range queries on encrypted databases. We propose a novel indexing scheme, 'CryptRange', that leverages homomorphic encryption and hierarchical clustering to minimize decryption overhead. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale dataset demonstrates that CryptRange outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by up to 3x in query execution time while maintaining strong security guarantees.
