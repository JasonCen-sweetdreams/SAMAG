Query optimization is a critical component of distributed databases, as it directly impacts query latency and system throughput. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based systems, which can be suboptimal and inflexible. This paper explores the application of deep reinforcement learning to query optimization, where an agent learns to optimize queries through trial and error. We propose a novel architecture, 'DQN-Opt', that leverages graph neural networks to represent query plans and reinforcement learning to optimize the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that DQN-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of system throughput.
