Ad-hoc retrieval systems often rely on query expansion to improve retrieval effectiveness. However, traditional expansion methods based on term co-occurrence or frequency analysis can be computationally expensive and may not capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages semantic embeddings to capture contextual relationships between terms. Our method, 'SemEx', uses a graph-based algorithm to identify relevant expansion terms and weights them based on their semantic similarity to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that SemEx outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
