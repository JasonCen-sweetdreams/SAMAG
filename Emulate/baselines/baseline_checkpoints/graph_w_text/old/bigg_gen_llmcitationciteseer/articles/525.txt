Augmented reality (AR) technologies have the potential to support older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing interfaces often pose accessibility barriers. This paper presents the results of a participatory design study with 20 older adults with mild cognitive impairment, aimed at developing accessible AR interfaces. We introduce the 'CARE' framework, which incorporates simplification, personalization, and cognitive support strategies to facilitate AR interaction. A usability evaluation of our CARE-based AR prototype demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to a baseline AR interface.
