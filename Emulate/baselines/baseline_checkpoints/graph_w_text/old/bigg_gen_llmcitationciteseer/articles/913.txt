Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of distributed query planning and execution. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph-based indexing, parallel query execution, and adaptive optimization techniques to improve query performance and scalability. Our experimental evaluation on a range of graph datasets demonstrates that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time and 2x in terms of scalability.
