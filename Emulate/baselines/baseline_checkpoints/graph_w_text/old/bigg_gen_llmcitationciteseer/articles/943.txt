This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed a VR system that utilizes machine learning-based hand tracking and haptic feedback to simulate real-world gestures. In a user study, we found that participants who used embodied gestures in VR showed improved cognitive recall and task performance compared to those who used traditional controllers. Our results suggest that incorporating embodied cognition principles in VR can enhance user experience and performance in various applications, including education, training, and therapy.
