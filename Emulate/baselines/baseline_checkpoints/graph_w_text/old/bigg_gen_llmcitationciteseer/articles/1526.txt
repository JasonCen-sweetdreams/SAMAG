Neural search engines have revolutionized the Information Retrieval (IR) landscape, but they often struggle with sparse queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'CAWE-EXPAND', which leverages context-aware word embeddings to generate more informative and diverse expansion terms. By incorporating contextualized semantic representations, CAWE-EXPAND outperforms existing methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
