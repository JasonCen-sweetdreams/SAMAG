Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains limited. This paper presents 'EasyVA', a novel design framework that incorporates cognitive support features to facilitate user interaction. We conducted a user study with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments and found that EasyVA improved task completion rates by 35% and reduced user frustration by 40% compared to existing voice assistants. Our findings inform the development of more accessible and inclusive voice assistants for this growing population.
