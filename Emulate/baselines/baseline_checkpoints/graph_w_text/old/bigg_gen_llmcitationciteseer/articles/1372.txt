In multi-agent systems, understanding the decision-making process is crucial for trust and reliability. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent settings. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant information from other agents, while a hierarchical structure allows for the integration of local and global context. Experimental results on a simulated rescue scenario demonstrate improved decision quality and interpretable explanations compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods.
