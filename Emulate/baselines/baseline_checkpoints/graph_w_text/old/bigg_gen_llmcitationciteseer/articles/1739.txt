Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often present barriers to adoption and accessibility. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop accessible VR interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our proposed interface, 'CognitiveVR', incorporates simplified navigation, audio cues, and personalized feedback mechanisms to facilitate user engagement and comprehension. A usability evaluation with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to conventional VR interfaces.
