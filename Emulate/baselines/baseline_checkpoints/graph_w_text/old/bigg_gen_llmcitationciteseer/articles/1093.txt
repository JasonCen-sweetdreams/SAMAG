Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a given question. While dense retrieval methods have shown promising results, they often struggle to scale to large corpora. This paper proposes a hierarchical dense retrieval approach, 'HDPR', which leverages a two-stage retrieval framework to efficiently identify relevant passages. We introduce a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups similar passages and a dense retriever that learns to rank passages within each cluster. Experimental results on several ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that HDPR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing the number of required similarity computations by up to 75%.
