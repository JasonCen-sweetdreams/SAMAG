Recommender systems are crucial for personalized services, but scaling to large user-item graphs remains a significant challenge. We propose 'HiGAT', a novel hierarchical graph attention network that learns to represent users and items as hierarchical entities. HiGAT leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between users, items, and their attributes, and demonstrates improved recommendation accuracy and scalability on several real-world datasets. Our experiments show that HiGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including graph convolutional networks and matrix factorization, on datasets with millions of users and items.
