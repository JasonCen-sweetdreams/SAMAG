The proliferation of big data has led to increased query complexity, resulting in slower response times and decreased system performance. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DeepQOpt', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for multidimensional big data. We introduce a hierarchical neural network architecture that learns to predict optimal query plans based on query characteristics, data distribution, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world big data benchmark demonstrate that DeepQOpt outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query execution time and 25% in terms of system resource utilization.
