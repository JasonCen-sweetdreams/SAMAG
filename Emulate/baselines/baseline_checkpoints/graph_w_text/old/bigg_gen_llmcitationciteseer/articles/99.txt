Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data management, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing technique, called 'GraDI', which leverages graph neural networks to learn query patterns and optimize index selection. We show that GraDI outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization methods by up to 30% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of GraDI in improving query performance and scalability.
