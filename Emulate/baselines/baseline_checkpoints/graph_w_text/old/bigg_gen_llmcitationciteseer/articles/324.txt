Virtual reality (VR) systems often rely on cumbersome controllers or restrictive head-mounted displays. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction system using deep learning-based eye tracking. Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) to accurately predict user gaze in 3D spaces. We evaluate our system in a VR environment, demonstrating improved interaction accuracy and reduced latency compared to existing methods. Furthermore, our approach enables intuitive and hands-free control of VR interfaces, enhancing the overall user experience.
