Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR interfaces often exclude this population due to inaccessible design. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR interfaces for this demographic. We conducted participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our proposed interface, 'CARE-VR', incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified navigation, error forgiveness, and personalized feedback. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing VR interfaces.
