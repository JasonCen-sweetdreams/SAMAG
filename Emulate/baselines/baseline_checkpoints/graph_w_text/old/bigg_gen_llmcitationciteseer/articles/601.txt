Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are increasingly used to index and search large-scale document collections. However, existing DIR systems suffer from high communication overhead and slow query response times. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation (HDR) framework that enables efficient retrieval in DIR systems. HDR leverages a multi-level encoding scheme to compress document representations, reducing the amount of transferred data during query processing. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HDR achieves significant improvements in query response time and communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art DIR systems.
