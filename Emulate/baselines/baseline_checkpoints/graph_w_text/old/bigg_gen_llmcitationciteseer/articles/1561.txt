Graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks, but their applicability to few-shot node classification remains limited. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs. Our approach adapts to novel classes with limited labeled data by learning hierarchical representations that capture both local and global graph structures. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms existing methods in few-shot node classification scenarios, particularly when dealing with graph-structured data with diverse node degrees and community structures.
