Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and industry. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages both local and global contextual information to detect anomalies. Our approach incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales, enabling the model to focus on relevant segments and features. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides insightful visualizations for explainability.
