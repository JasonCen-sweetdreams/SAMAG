Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR) due to the inherent uncertainty in user queries. Query expansion techniques have been proposed to alleviate this issue, but their effectiveness is often limited by the quality of expansion terms. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Our proposed model, 'DeepQE', combines a transformer-based encoder with a graph attention mechanism to generate high-quality expansion terms that better capture user intent. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
