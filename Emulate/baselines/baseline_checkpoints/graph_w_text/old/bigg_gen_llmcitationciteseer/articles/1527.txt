Virtual reality (VR) has shown great potential in enhancing learning experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of gamification on user engagement in VR-based learning environments. We designed and developed a gamified VR learning platform that incorporates rewards, leaderboards, and social sharing features. A user study with 120 participants reveals that gamification significantly increases user engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes. Our results also indicate that the type of gamification elements used can influence user behavior and learning performance. The findings of this study have implications for the design of engaging and effective VR-based learning experiences.
