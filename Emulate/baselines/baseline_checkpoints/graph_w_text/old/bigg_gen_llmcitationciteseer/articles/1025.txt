Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict the optimal query plan based on the query workload, data distribution, and system configuration. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
