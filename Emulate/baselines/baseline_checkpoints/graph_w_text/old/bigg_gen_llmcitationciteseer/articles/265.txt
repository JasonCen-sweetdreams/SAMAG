Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph neural networks, where only a limited number of labeled nodes are available for training. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages self-attention mechanisms at multiple scales to capture complex relational patterns in the graph. Our HGAN model consists of a hierarchical encoder that aggregates node features at different levels of abstraction, followed by a few-shot classifier that adapts to the target node's neighborhood. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification tasks, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 12.5%.
