Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR interfaces. We designed an experiment with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibit significantly higher levels of engagement, measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported enjoyment. We also explore the role of psychological ownership and self-representation in mediating this effect. The findings have implications for the design of VR interfaces that prioritize user engagement and immersion.
