 Passage retrieval is a crucial step in many information retrieval systems, but existing methods often struggle with scalability and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation, 'HDRep', which enables efficient passage retrieval by capturing both local and global semantic relationships within documents. HDRep leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant sentences and phrases, and subsequently employs a learned indexing scheme to facilitate fast retrieval. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that HDRep outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods in terms of both MAP and retrieval efficiency.
