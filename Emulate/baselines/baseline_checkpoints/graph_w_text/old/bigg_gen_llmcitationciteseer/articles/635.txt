Recommendation systems have become increasingly crucial in modern online platforms. However, existing methods struggle to handle large-scale user-item interaction graphs. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAN) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges. We propose a hierarchical pooling strategy that captures both local and global structural patterns, enabling efficient scalability to massive graphs. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, while reducing computational costs by up to 75%.
