Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing systems often neglect their unique needs. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create an accessible conversational interface tailored to this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, identifying key design principles and requirements. Our prototype, CogChat, incorporates features such as simplified language processing, visual cues, and error forgiveness. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in interaction success rates and user satisfaction compared to a commercial conversational AI system.
