As database systems continue to evolve, query optimization remains a critical bottleneck in achieving high performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning techniques to optimize query plans. We develop a graph neural network-based model that learns to predict optimal join orders and indexing strategies from a database's workload and schema. Our experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in query execution times, outperforming state-of-the-art query optimizers. Furthermore, we provide insights into the interpretability of our model, enabling database administrators to make informed decisions about query optimization.
