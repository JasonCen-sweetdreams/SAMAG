Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments face significant barriers in accessing and interacting with VR environments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces tailored to the needs of visually impaired users. We propose a multimodal approach that combines haptic feedback, audio cues, and speech input to enable users to navigate and interact with virtual objects. A user study with 20 visually impaired participants demonstrates that our framework significantly improves their VR experience, with enhanced spatial awareness, reduced cognitive load, and increased overall satisfaction.
