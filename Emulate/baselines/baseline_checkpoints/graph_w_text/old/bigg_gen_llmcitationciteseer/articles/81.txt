Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, but its performance is often limited by the quality of the query. Query expansion techniques aim to improve retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach to query expansion, which leverages the semantic relationships between terms in the query and the document collection. Our model, called 'QueryExpander', uses a combination of word embeddings and recurrent neural networks to generate a set of expanded queries that capture the nuances of the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QueryExpander outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
