Multi-agent systems have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their potential to solve complex real-world problems. However, task allocation in such systems remains a challenging problem, especially when dealing with heterogeneous agents. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the underlying task allocation policy. Our approach, termed 'GNN-TA', models the agent interactions as a graph and uses GNNs to learn the optimal task assignment. We evaluate GNN-TA on a variety of benchmark problems and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art decentralized task allocation algorithms.
