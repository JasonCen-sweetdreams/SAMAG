Time-series databases have become increasingly popular in various domains, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, query processing in these databases remains a significant challenge due to the high volume and velocity of data. This paper presents a comprehensive study of indexing methods for efficient query processing in time-series databases. We propose a novel indexing technique, 'TS-Tree', which leverages a combination of clustering and caching to reduce query latency. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TS-Tree outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
