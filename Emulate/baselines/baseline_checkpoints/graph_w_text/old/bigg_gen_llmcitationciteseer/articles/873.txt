Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their effectiveness for users with disabilities is often limited by their inability to recognize emotional cues. This paper presents an audio-based emotion recognition system designed specifically for users with disabilities. We conducted a user study with 30 participants with varying disabilities and found that our system achieves an accuracy of 85% in recognizing emotions, outperforming commercial voice assistants. We also provide guidelines for designing inclusive voice assistants that prioritize empathy and understanding.
