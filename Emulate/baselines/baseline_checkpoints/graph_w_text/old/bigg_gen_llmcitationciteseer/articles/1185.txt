In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires agents to coordinate and make decisions without a centralized authority. This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation using reinforcement learning. We propose a deep Q-network-based algorithm that enables agents to learn optimal task allocation policies through interactions with their environment. Our approach is evaluated in a realistic simulated scenario, where agents must allocate tasks to achieve a common goal while minimizing conflicts and maximizing overall system efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task allocation efficiency and scalability in decentralized multi-agent systems.
