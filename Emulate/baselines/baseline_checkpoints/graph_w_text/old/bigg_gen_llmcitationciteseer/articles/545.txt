Diverse document retrieval aims to retrieve a set of relevant and diverse documents for a given query. Existing methods often rely on simple aggregation techniques, which may not capture complex relationships between documents. This paper proposes a novel re-ranking framework, Hierarchical Graph Attention (HGA), which models document relationships using a hierarchical graph structure. HGA leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture both local and global contextual information, enabling more accurate and diverse document retrieval. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGA in improving retrieval diversity and relevance.
