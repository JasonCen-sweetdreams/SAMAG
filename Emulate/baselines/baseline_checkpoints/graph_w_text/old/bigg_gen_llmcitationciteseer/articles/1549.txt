Time series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, such as finance and healthcare. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it difficult to identify the root causes of anomalies. We propose a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages both local and global contextual information to detect anomalies in time series data. Our approach incorporates explainable attention mechanisms, enabling the identification of relevant features and time segments contributing to anomalies. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while providing meaningful explanations.
