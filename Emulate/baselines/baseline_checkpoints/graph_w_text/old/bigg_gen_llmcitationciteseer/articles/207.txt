This paper presents a human-centered design approach for creating accessible conversational interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities for improving the usability of conversational systems. Our findings inform the development of a novel interface framework, 'CARE', which incorporates multimodal input, simplified dialogue flows, and personalized feedback mechanisms. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates that CARE significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
