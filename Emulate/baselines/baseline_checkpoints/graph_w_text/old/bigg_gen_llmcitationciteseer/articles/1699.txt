Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion, leveraging dense passage retrieval (DPR) to identify semantically relevant terms. We introduce a neural ranking model that jointly optimizes query-term similarity and passage relevance, enabling more effective query expansion. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and reciprocal rank over state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing the potential of DPR-based query expansion for ad-hoc search.
