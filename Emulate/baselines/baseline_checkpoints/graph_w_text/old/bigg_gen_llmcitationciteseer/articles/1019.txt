Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph patterns and the distributed nature of the data. This paper presents a novel query optimization technique for distributed graph databases, based on subgraph homomorphism. Our approach leverages a hierarchical graph decomposition to reduce the search space and employs a novel cost model to estimate the query execution time. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 3x speedup compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
