Query optimization is a critical component of relational database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and system throughput. This paper introduces 'GraphOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model complex relationships between query patterns and database schema. By learning a compact representation of the query space, GraphOpt can efficiently prune the search space of possible query plans, reducing optimization time by up to 70% compared to traditional optimization techniques. Experimental results on the TPCH benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphOpt in improving query performance and reducing optimization overhead.
