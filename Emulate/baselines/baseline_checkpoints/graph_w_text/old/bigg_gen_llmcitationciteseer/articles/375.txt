Distributed database systems have become increasingly complex, making query optimization a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RL-Optimizer', that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed databases. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and use deep Q-networks to learn an optimal policy for query plan selection. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of execution time and resource utilization, while adapting to changing workloads and system dynamics.
