This paper proposes a novel approach to coordinating heterogeneous agents in smart traffic management systems using multi-objective reinforcement learning. Our framework, called HARMONY, integrates autonomous vehicles, traffic signals, and pedestrian agents to optimize multiple objectives, including travel time, safety, and emissions. We employ a decentralized, multi-agent Q-learning algorithm that adapts to dynamic traffic patterns and learns to balance competing objectives. Experimental results on a realistic simulation platform demonstrate that HARMONY outperforms traditional traffic management strategies, reducing congestion and emissions by up to 25% while improving safety.
