Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but its effectiveness hinges on the quality of the expansion terms. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'RQE', which formulates query expansion as a sequential decision-making problem. RQE employs a deep Q-network to select the most informative expansion terms, leveraging user feedback and document relevance signals. Experimental results on the TREC news dataset demonstrate that RQE outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall.
