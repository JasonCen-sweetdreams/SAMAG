Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly being used in education, but the impact of embodiment on user experience in VR-based learning environments remains unclear. This study investigates how different levels of embodiment, ranging from non-embodied to fully embodied avatars, influence user engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention. Our results show that users who interacted with fully embodied avatars reported higher levels of presence and engagement, but also experienced increased cognitive load. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR-based learning environments and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of embodiment in VR.
