Distributed query processing in column-store databases is crucial for big data analytics, but suboptimal join orders can lead to significant performance degradation. This paper presents a novel cost-based optimization framework, 'DistroJoin', which leverages statistical models and machine learning techniques to predict the optimal join order for complex queries. We demonstrate that DistroJoin outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques in reducing query latency and improving resource utilization, while also providing robustness to data skew and distribution changes. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show an average query speedup of 3.2x compared to traditional optimization methods.
