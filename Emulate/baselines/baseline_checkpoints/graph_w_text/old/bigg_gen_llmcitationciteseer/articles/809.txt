Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often neglect the needs of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible VR interfaces tailored to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with caregivers and older adults to identify design requirements and developed a novel VR interface that incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified navigation and memory aids. Our evaluation study shows that the designed interface significantly improves user experience and reduces cognitive load for older adults with cognitive impairments.
