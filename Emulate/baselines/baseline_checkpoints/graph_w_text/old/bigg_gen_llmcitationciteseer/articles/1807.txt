Traditional document retrieval models often neglect the contextual dependencies between query terms and document entities. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, 'ContextRank', that adaptively re-ranks documents based on their semantic relationships with the query context. Our approach leverages a graph-based representation of the query-document interaction, enabling the model to capture both local and global contextual patterns. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that ContextRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving a 12.3% improvement in mean average precision.
