Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. While deep learning models have shown promise in this area, they often lack transparency and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies in time series data while providing explainable insights into the detection process. Our model combines local and global attention mechanisms to identify relevant features and contextual patterns. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods while offering enhanced explainability and visualization capabilities.
