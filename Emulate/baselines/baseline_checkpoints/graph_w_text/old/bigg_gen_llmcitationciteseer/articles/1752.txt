Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but understanding the cognitive implications of immersive experiences remains a pressing research question. This study explores the role of embodied cognition in VR, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed a series of experiments using a custom-built VR platform, where participants performed manipulation tasks with varying levels of gestural freedom. Results show that embodied cognition significantly enhances task performance, user engagement, and cognitive load reduction. Our findings have implications for the design of intuitive, gesture-based interfaces in VR applications, such as gaming, education, and training.
