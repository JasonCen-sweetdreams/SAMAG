Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph indexing, query rewriting, and cost-based optimization to improve query performance. We introduce a novel graph indexing technique that adaptively partitions the graph based on query patterns, and a query rewriting algorithm that minimizes communication overhead. Experimental results on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of throughput.
