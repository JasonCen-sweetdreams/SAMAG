Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complex interactions between query patterns, data distribution, and system resources. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to select optimal query plans based on feedback from the database. Our experiments on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and scalability compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
