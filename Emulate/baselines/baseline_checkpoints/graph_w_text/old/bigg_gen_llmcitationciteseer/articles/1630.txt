Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for selecting efficient execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
