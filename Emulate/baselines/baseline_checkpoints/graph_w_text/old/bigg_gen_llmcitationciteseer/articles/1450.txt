Multi-agent systems are increasingly prevalent in real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and robot swarms. This paper introduces a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, DMARL, that enables agents to learn and adapt in dynamic, uncertain environments. DMARL incorporates a novel task allocation mechanism that allows agents to dynamically adjust their roles and responsibilities based on changing environmental conditions. We evaluate DMARL on a suite of benchmark problems, demonstrating improved performance and robustness compared to centralized and distributed baselines.
