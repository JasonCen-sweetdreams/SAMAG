The proliferation of semi-structured data has led to a surge in demand for efficient retrieval mechanisms. Existing indexing techniques, such as XML indexing and keyword-based indexing, have limitations in terms of query performance and data coverage. This paper proposes a hybrid indexing approach, 'HybridIX', which combines the strengths of both techniques. HybridIX utilizes a novel graph-based indexing structure to facilitate efficient query processing and incorporates a machine learning-based relevance ranking model to improve result accuracy. Experimental results on a large-scale semi-structured dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and result quality compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
