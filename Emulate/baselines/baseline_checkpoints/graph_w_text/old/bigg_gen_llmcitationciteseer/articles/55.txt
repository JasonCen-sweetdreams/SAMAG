Real-time data warehousing applications require efficient query optimization to ensure low-latency responses. Traditional cardinality estimation methods often rely on outdated statistics, leading to suboptimal query plans. This paper presents 'LCE-Optimizer', a novel adaptive query optimization framework that leverages machine learning to learn cardinality estimation models from query feedback. Our approach integrates a learned cardinality estimator with a cost-based optimizer, enabling dynamic adaptation to changing data distributions. Experimental results on a real-world data warehousing benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in query response times and reduced optimization overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.
