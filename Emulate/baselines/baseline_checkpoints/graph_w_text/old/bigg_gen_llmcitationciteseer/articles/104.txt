In this paper, we present a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to be assigned tasks in a dynamic environment. We propose an auction-based mechanism that leverages the concept of virtual currencies to facilitate task allocation. Our approach ensures allocation efficiency, fairness, and adaptability to changing agent preferences and task requirements. We evaluate the performance of our framework through extensive simulations, demonstrating significant improvements over existing centralized and distributed allocation methods.
