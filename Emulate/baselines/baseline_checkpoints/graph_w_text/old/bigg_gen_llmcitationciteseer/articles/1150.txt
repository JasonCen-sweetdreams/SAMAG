Ad-hoc retrieval involves retrieving relevant documents for a given query. Current neural ranking models are computationally expensive and require significant resources. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking approach, 'HierRank', which efficiently filters out irrelevant documents using a coarse-to-fine ranking strategy. We leverage pre-trained language models as feature extractors and introduce a document clustering module to reduce the number of documents required for fine-grained ranking. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierRank achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational costs by up to 75% compared to existing neural ranking models.
