Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep reinforcement learning model that learns to predict optimal query plans based on query characteristics and system workload. Our experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
