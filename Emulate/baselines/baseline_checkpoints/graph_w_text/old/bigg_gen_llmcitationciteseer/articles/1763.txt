Collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems often struggle to scale with large user-item graphs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that efficiently captures complex relationships between users and items. By recursively applying graph attention mechanisms at multiple scales, HGAT learns to represent users and items as hierarchical embeddings, enabling accurate and efficient recommendations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both recommendation quality and computational efficiency.
