As distributed relational databases become increasingly prevalent, query optimization remains a critical performance bottleneck. This paper presents 'ML-QOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning to predict optimal execution plans. We propose a graph neural network-based approach to model query plans and a reinforcement learning-based optimizer to select the best plan. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that ML-QOpt outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers by up to 3x and achieves near-optimal performance in complex query scenarios.
