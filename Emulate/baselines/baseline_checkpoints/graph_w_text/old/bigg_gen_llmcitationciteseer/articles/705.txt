This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems operating in dynamic environments. We propose a novel reinforcement learning approach, where agents learn to adapt to changing environmental conditions and allocate tasks based on their individual capabilities and the global system state. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion efficiency and system robustness. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm's convergence properties.
