Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem in distributed artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinate agents using hierarchical reinforcement learning. Our method, called Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (H-MARL), consists of two levels: a high-level coordinator that generates global goals, and low-level agents that learn to achieve these goals through reinforcement learning. We evaluate H-MARL in a variety of scenarios, including robotic teams and smart traffic management, and demonstrate improved coordination and task completion rates compared to existing methods.
