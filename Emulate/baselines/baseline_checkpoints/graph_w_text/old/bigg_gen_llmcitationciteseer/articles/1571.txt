Join ordering is a critical optimization problem in distributed database systems, as it significantly affects query performance. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, which can be suboptimal and computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize join ordering. We design a customized neural network architecture that learns to predict the optimal join order from a large dataset of query workloads. Experimental results on a realistic distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
