In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving optimal performance. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic environments. Our approach, called 'AdaptAlloc', enables agents to learn from experience and adjust their task assignments in real-time, taking into account factors such as agent capabilities, task dependencies, and resource constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that AdaptAlloc outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system robustness.
