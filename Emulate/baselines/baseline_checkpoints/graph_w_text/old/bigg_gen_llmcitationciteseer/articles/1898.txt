Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights into the relevant temporal and feature-wise patterns. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture complex dependencies in the data and generates attention weights that indicate the contribution of each feature and time step to the anomaly score. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies and its ability to provide actionable explanations.
