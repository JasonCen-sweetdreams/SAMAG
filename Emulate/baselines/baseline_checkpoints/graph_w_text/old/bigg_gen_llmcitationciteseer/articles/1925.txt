Multi-tenant database systems are increasingly popular for their scalability and cost-effectiveness. However, they introduce complexities in query optimization, particularly when rewriting queries for multiple tenants. This paper presents a novel query rewriting framework, 'TenantAware', which leverages tenant-specific metadata and query patterns to optimize query plans. We propose a two-phase approach, combining offline analysis of tenant workloads with online optimization of query execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to existing approaches.
