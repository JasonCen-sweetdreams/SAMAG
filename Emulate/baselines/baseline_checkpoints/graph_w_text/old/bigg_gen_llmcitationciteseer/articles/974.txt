In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and employ reinforcement learning to train agents to allocate tasks based on their capabilities and environmental constraints. Our approach, dubbed 'DAGMA', utilizes a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn optimal task allocation policies. Experimental results on a realistic simulation environment demonstrate that DAGMA outperforms traditional centralized and distributed allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency and system adaptability.
