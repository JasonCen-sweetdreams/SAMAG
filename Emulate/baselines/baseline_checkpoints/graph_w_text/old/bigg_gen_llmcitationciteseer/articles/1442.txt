Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate query optimization as a Markov decision process and design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on runtime statistics and system feedback. Our experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while also adapting to changing workload patterns.
