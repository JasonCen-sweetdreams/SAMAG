Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the retrieval performance. Traditional query expansion methods rely on hand-crafted rules and statistical models, which may not capture the complex relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach for query expansion, which learns to generate relevant expansion terms from a large corpus of text data. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
