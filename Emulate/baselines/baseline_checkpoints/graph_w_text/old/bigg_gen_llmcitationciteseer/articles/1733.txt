Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability and accessibility remain a concern for older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EASE', a novel voice assistant interface tailored to the needs of this demographic. EASE incorporates simplifications to the dialogue flow, visual cues to support auditory information, and personalized prompts to facilitate task completion. Our user study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments reveals significant improvements in task success rates, user satisfaction, and perceived ease of use compared to commercial voice assistants.
