Distributed database systems are increasingly adopted in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes an adaptive partitioning strategy that dynamically adjusts data distribution across nodes based on query patterns and workload characteristics. Our approach, 'ADAPT', leverages machine learning-based query prediction and distributed indexing to minimize data transfer and improve query response times. Experimental results on a real-world benchmark dataset demonstrate that ADAPT outperforms state-of-the-art partitioning schemes, achieving up to 3x query performance improvement and 2x reduction in network latency.
