Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a concern. This study investigates the design of inclusive voice-based interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving co-design workshops, usability testing, and cognitive assessments with 25 older adults with cognitive impairments. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and feedback in voice-based interface design. We propose a set of design guidelines and a novel interface framework, 'CogniVoice', which incorporates personalized support and adaptation mechanisms to accommodate individual cognitive abilities.
