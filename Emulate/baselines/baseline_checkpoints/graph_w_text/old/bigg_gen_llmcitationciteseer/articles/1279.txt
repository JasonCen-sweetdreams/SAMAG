Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, optimizing queries in distributed graph databases remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, indexing, and parallel processing to achieve scalable query performance. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that dynamically selects the most efficient query plan based on the graph structure, query patterns, and available system resources. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt achieves an average query speedup of 3.5x compared to existing optimization techniques.
