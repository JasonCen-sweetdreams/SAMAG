In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a fundamental problem that requires coordinating agents to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies. Our method, called GraphTask, represents the agent-task graph as a neural network and uses attention mechanisms to identify suitable agents for each task. We evaluate GraphTask on a range of benchmark scenarios and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion efficiency and agent utilization compared to existing methods. The results highlight the potential of GNNs in enabling adaptive and efficient multi-agent systems.
