Ad-hoc retrieval techniques often rely on query expansion to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'NDE-QE', which leverages neural document embeddings to generate context-aware query expansions. We introduce a two-stage framework that first learns a dense representation of documents using a variants of BERT, and then uses these embeddings to identify relevant expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that NDE-QE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 12% improvement in mean average precision.
