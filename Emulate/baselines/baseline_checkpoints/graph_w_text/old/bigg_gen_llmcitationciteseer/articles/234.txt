Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of static and dynamic analysis to optimize query execution plans. GraphOpt incorporates a graph-aware cost model and a reinforcement learning-based optimization algorithm to minimize query latency and reduce resource utilization. Experiment results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query performance.
