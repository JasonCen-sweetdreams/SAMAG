Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages the semantic relationships between query terms to generate effective expansion terms. Our model consists of a multi-layer perceptron that takes into account both local and global context information, and is trained on a large-scale dataset of query logs. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
