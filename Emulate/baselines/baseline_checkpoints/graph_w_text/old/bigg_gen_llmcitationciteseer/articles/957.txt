This study investigates the effects of anthropomorphic chatbots on user trust in e-commerce environments. We conducted a between-subjects experiment with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to interact with either an anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic chatbot while completing a series of tasks on a simulated e-commerce platform. Results show that users who interacted with the anthropomorphic chatbot reported higher levels of trust and perceived the chatbot as more helpful and engaging. However, we also found that this effect was moderated by individual differences in users' need for cognition and social presence. Our findings have implications for the design of chatbots in e-commerce settings and highlight the importance of considering user characteristics in HCI research.
