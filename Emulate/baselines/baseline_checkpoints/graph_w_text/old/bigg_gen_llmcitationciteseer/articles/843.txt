Multi-tenant database systems face significant performance challenges due to varying workloads and resource constraints. Traditional query optimization techniques often rely on heuristics or rule-based approaches, which may not adapt well to dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-Optimizer', that leverages reinforcement learning to learn optimal query plans for multi-tenant databases. We design a customized reward function that balances query latency, resource utilization, and fairness across tenants. Experimental results on a real-world cloud database platform demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of average query response time.
