Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, but they often lack uncertainty estimates, which are crucial for real-world applications. This paper proposes a scalable Bayesian neural network framework, 'BayesVision', that leverages stochastic variational inference to efficiently approximate posterior distributions over neural network weights. We develop a novel hierarchical prior that captures complex dependencies between weights and demonstrate improved uncertainty estimates on several benchmark datasets, including ImageNet and CIFAR-10. BayesVision enables robust and interpretable computer vision models that can quantify uncertainty, facilitating deployment in safety-critical applications.
