Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when dealing with novel classes and limited training data. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that adaptively focuses on relevant regions and features to improve few-shot learning. Our approach leverages a multi-scale feature extractor and a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global context. We evaluate HAN on popular few-shot benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical attention in few-shot image classification, especially when dealing with fine-grained object recognition.
