Ad-hoc retrieval in knowledge graphs (KGs) has gained increasing attention due to its potential in various applications. However, the complexity of KGs and the ambiguity of user queries pose significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'DQR', which reformulates user queries to better match the KG structure. DQR employs a graph attention mechanism to identify relevant entities and relationships, and a reinforcement learning component to optimize the reformulation process. Experimental results on three large-scale KGs demonstrate that DQR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
