Domain-specific search engines require tailored query expansion techniques to effectively retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach, DeepQE, which leverages deep neural networks to learn domain-specific query representations. We design a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion and document ranking, resulting in significant improvements in search accuracy. Experiments on three domain-specific datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, including those based on BM25 and word embeddings.
