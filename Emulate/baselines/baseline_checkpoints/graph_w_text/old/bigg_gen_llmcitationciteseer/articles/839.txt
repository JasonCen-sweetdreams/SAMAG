Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query plans in distributed environments. We propose a query optimization framework, 'QOptML', which utilizes a graph neural network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query patterns, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that QOptML reduces query execution time by up to 30% compared to traditional query optimization techniques, while also improving system throughput and scalability.
