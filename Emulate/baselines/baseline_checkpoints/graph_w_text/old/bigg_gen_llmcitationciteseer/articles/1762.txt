Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their error-prone nature can lead to user frustration and exclusion. This paper presents a user-centered approach to error recovery in voice assistants, focusing on individuals with disabilities. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, exploring the effectiveness of three novel error recovery strategies: proactive clarification, contextual hinting, and personalized feedback. Our results show that these strategies significantly improve user experience, reducing errors by 35% and increasing user satisfaction by 27%. We provide design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants that prioritize user needs and abilities.
