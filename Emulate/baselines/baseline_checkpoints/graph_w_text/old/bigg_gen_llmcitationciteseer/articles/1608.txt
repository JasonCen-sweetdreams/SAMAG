In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex graph-structured data. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework for explainable multi-agent decision-making. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant subgraphs, enabling agents to make more informed decisions. We evaluate HGAT on a real-world autonomous vehicle dataset, demonstrating improved decision-making accuracy and interpretability compared to existing graph-based methods. Furthermore, our framework provides visual explanations of agent decisions, enhancing transparency and trust in multi-agent systems.
