Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for storing and processing large amounts of data. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization approach using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, called QOptimizer, learns to select the optimal query plan by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. We evaluate QOptimizer on a real-world distributed database system and show that it outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
