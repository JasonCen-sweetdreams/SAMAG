Coordinating multi-agent systems in complex environments is a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach using hierarchical graph attention networks (HGATs) to model agent interactions and learn effective coordination strategies. Our method leverages the hierarchical structure of agent relationships to selectively focus on relevant agents and tasks, enabling more efficient and scalable coordination. We evaluate our approach on a range of multi-agent tasks, including traffic management and robotic swarm control, demonstrating improved performance and adaptability compared to existing methods.
