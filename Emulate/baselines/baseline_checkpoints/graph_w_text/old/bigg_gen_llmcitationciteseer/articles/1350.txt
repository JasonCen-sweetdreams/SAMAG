Query optimization is crucial for efficient data retrieval in distributed relational databases. Traditional rule-based approaches often fail to adapt to complex data distributions and dynamic workloads. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based query optimization framework, 'OptiQL', which leverages query execution plans and runtime statistics to predict optimal join orders and indexing strategies. We evaluate OptiQL on a real-world database benchmark and demonstrate significant performance gains (up to 3.5x) compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing database management systems, enabling more efficient and scalable data processing.
