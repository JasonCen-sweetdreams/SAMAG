Autonomous agents are increasingly being used in complex tasks, such as search and rescue operations, that require effective task allocation. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework, 'RL-Agent', which utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments among agents. RL-Agent learns to adapt to dynamic environment changes, agent failures, and communication constraints, outperforming traditional centralized algorithms in simulation experiments. We demonstrate the feasibility of RL-Agent in a real-world drone-based surveillance scenario, showcasing its potential for real-time task allocation in autonomous systems.
