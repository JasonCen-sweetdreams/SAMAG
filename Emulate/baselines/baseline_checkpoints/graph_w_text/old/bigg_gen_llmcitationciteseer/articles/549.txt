This study explores the design and evaluation of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) for elderly healthcare. We developed an ECA system, 'CareBot', that integrates speech, gesture, and facial recognition to provide personalized support for older adults with chronic conditions. A mixed-methods approach was employed to assess the efficacy of CareBot in reducing healthcare costs, improving patient engagement, and enhancing overall well-being. Results from a 6-month pilot study with 30 participants indicate significant improvements in medication adherence, emotional support, and user satisfaction, highlighting the potential of ECAs in geriatric care.
