Entity disambiguation remains a critical challenge in knowledge graph search, where user queries often refer to multiple entities with similar names. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages semantic role labeling and dependency parsing to better capture the query context. We develop a probabilistic graphical model to integrate entity mentions, context words, and knowledge graph relationships, enabling more accurate disambiguation. Experimental results on the Wikidata and DBpedia datasets demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
