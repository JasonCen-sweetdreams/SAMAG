Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in modern data centers, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on execution time. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database show that the proposed approach achieves an average speedup of 2.5x compared to traditional query optimization techniques. We also demonstrate the adaptability of our approach to changing database workloads and query patterns.
