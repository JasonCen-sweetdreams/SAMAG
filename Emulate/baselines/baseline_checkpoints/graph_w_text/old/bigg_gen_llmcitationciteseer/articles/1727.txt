Data warehousing and real-time analytics have become essential for business intelligence and decision-making. Materialized views (MVs) play a crucial role in data warehousing, but maintaining them in real-time is a significant challenge. This paper proposes an incremental materialized view maintenance approach, 'IncMVM', which leverages a novel combination of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and incremental view maintenance techniques. IncMVM reduces the maintenance cost and latency of MVs, enabling real-time analytics on large-scale datasets. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of IncMVM in terms of query performance and maintenance overhead.
