Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR), where the goal is to rank documents relevant to a given query. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'NeuRank', which leverages deep neural networks to learn a robust ranking function. We employ a multi-task learning approach, combining relevance ranking with query-document semantic matching. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuRank significantly outperforms traditional learning-to-rank models and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ad-hoc retrieval tasks.
