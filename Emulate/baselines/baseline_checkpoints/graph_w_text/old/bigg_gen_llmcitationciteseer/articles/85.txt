In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often involve complex interactions and dependencies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture to improve the explainability and transparency of multi-agent decision-making. Our approach incorporates attention mechanisms to model agent-agent and agent-environment interactions, allowing for interpretable and hierarchical representations of decision-making processes. Experimental results on a real-world traffic management scenario demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of decision quality and explainability, providing insights into the decision-making process of individual agents and the system as a whole.
