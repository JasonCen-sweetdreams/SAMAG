Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in data integration, where the goal is to identify the correct entity among a set of candidates. Existing approaches often suffer from scalability issues, particularly when dealing with large datasets. This paper proposes a novel approach, GHEC (Graph-based Hierarchical Entity Clustering), which leverages graph-based embeddings and hierarchical clustering to efficiently disambiguate entities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GHEC on several real-world datasets, showcasing its ability to scale to large datasets while maintaining high accuracy.
