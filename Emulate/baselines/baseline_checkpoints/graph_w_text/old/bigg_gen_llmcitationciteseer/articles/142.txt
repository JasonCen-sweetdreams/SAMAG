Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents an inclusive VR interface design framework that incorporates auditory and haptic feedback to facilitate navigation and interaction for visually impaired users. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to evaluate the effectiveness of our design and identify areas for improvement. Our results show that the proposed framework significantly improves the overall VR experience for users with visual impairments, enabling them to complete tasks with higher accuracy and confidence.
