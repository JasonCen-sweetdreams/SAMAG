Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this task, but they often struggle with complex temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures in the data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, 'HAT-GNN', which leverages both node-level and graph-level attention mechanisms to capture local and global patterns in time series data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAT-GNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to noise.
