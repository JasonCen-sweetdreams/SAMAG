This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and constraints need to collaborate to achieve a common goal. We formulate the problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem and propose a decentralized algorithm that utilizes asynchronous communication and iterative improvement to find near-optimal solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task allocation efficiency and scalability compared to existing centralized and decentralized approaches. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence and optimality of our algorithm.
