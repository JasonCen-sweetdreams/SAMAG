Distributed column stores have become a popular choice for real-time analytics, but existing indexing techniques struggle to keep up with the scale and velocity of modern datasets. This paper presents 'Colossus', a novel indexing framework designed specifically for distributed column stores. Colossus leverages a hierarchical indexing structure and a distributed, in-memory cache to enable fast query execution and efficient data ingestion. We evaluate Colossus on a 100-node cluster and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing techniques, achieving query latencies of under 100ms for complex analytical workloads.
