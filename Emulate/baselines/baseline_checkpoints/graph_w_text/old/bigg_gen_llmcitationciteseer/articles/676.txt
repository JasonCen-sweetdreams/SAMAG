Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network, HATAN, which leverages self-attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant temporal segments and features. HATAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, including the UCR Time Series Archive, while reducing computational overhead by up to 60% compared to existing attention-based approaches. We further demonstrate the applicability of HATAN to real-world datasets from energy consumption and traffic monitoring.
