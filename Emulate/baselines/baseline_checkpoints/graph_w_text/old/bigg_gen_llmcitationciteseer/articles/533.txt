Cold start recommendation, where new users or items lack historical interactions, is a long-standing challenge in personalized recommendation systems. We propose a novel hierarchical few-shot learning framework, 'GraphFS', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item relationships and adapt to new users or items with limited data. Our approach hierarchically clusters items into meta-classes and adapts the GNN's attention mechanism to few-shot learning. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphFS outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods in cold start recommendation, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall.
