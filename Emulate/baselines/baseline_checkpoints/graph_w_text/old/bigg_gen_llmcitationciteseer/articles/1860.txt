Query expansion (QE) is a crucial technique for improving the retrieval performance of search engines. However, existing QE methods often rely on manual feature engineering and fail to capture the nuances of natural language queries. This paper proposes a novel neural entity disambiguation (NED) approach that leverages pre-trained language models to dynamically expand queries. Our NED-based QE method, dubbed 'EntExp', disambiguates entities in the query using a knowledge graph and generates context-aware expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC 2020 dataset demonstrate that EntExp outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving a 15% relative improvement in mean average precision.
