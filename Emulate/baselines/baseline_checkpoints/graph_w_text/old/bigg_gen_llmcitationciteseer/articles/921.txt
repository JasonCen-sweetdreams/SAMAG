Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly adopted in modern data-intensive applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'QOptML', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning (ML) to improve query performance in DDS. QOptML uses a graph neural network to model query plans and predict optimal execution paths, taking into account dynamic workload and system conditions. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrate that QOptML outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average query latency reduction of 35% and a 25% improvement in system throughput.
