Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of personalized experiences. This paper presents a user study that investigates the effect of personalization on user experience in VR. We designed and implemented a VR system that adapts to users' preferences, goals, and behaviors, and evaluated its impact on user engagement, satisfaction, and performance. Our results show that personalized VR experiences lead to significant improvements in user experience, especially for users with diverse abilities and needs. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of inclusive and effective VR systems.
