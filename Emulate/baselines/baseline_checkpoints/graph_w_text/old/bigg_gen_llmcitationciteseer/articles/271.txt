Column-store indexing has become a popular choice for big data analytics due to its ability to reduce storage costs and improve query performance. However, existing query optimization techniques for column-store indexing are often inadequate, leading to suboptimal query plans. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'CSI-Opt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and a column-store aware query optimizer. CSI-Opt is shown to outperform state-of-the-art query optimizers on a range of benchmarks, achieving an average speedup of 3.2x for analytic workloads.
