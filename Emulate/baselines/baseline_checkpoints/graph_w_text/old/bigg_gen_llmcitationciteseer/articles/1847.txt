Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph data and the need to minimize communication overhead between nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical partitioning approach, called HiQP, which efficiently optimizes query plans for distributed graph databases. HiQP leverages graph structural properties to partition the graph into hierarchical clusters, enabling the construction of more efficient query plans that reduce communication costs. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets show that HiQP outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
