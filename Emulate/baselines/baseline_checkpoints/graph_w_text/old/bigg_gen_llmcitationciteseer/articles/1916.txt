Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, including education, entertainment, and healthcare. However, users with visual impairments face significant barriers in accessing VR experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces that cater to users with visual impairments. We introduce a set of guidelines and a prototype system that incorporates audio-based navigation, haptic feedback, and personalized assistance. Our user study with 20 participants demonstrates improved usability and user satisfaction compared to existing VR systems. The findings of this study have implications for the development of inclusive VR applications.
