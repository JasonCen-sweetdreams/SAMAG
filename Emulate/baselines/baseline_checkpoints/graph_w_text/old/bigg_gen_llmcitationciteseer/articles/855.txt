Few-shot node classification on graph-structured data remains a challenging problem, particularly when dealing with limited labeled data and complex relationships between nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global graph structures to improve few-shot learning performance. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges at different scales, enabling the model to adapt to new classes with limited supervision. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods on graph-structured data, achieving significant gains in accuracy and robustness.
