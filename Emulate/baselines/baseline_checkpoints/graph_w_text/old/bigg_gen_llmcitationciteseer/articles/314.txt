Multi-agent planning has numerous applications in areas like logistics, robotics, and smart cities. However, scaling up to large numbers of agents and tasks remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'Hierarchical Agent Planning' (HAP), which leverages hierarchical task networks to efficiently plan and coordinate tasks among multiple agents. HAP uses a hierarchical decomposition of tasks into sub-tasks, enabling agents to focus on local planning and coordination. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that HAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of planning efficiency, solution quality, and scalability.
