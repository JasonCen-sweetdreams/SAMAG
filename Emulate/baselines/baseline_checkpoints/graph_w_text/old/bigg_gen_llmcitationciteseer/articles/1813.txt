Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR systems often neglect their unique needs. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for this population. We conducted co-design workshops with older adults with cognitive impairments and caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, familiarity, and cognitive support in VR interfaces. We propose a set of guidelines for designing accessible VR experiences and demonstrate their feasibility through a case study of a VR-based cognitive training application.
