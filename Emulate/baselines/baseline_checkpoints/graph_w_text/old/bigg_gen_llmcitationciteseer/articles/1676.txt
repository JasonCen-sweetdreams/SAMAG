Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it aims to capture the underlying semantics of the query. Traditional methods rely on term co-occurrence statistics, which can be limited by the availability of relevant documents. This paper proposes a neural approach to query expansion, leveraging document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our model, NQE, learns to encode documents and queries in a shared vector space, enabling effective query expansion through vector operations. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that NQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
