As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible and inclusive interfaces that accommodate cognitive impairments. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interface, 'Easy Gesture', designed to assist older adults with cognitive impairments in interacting with digital devices. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, aged 65-85, and found that our adaptive gesture recognition algorithm, which incorporates machine learning-based error correction, significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional gesture-based interfaces. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of accessible HCI systems.
