In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework based on reinforcement learning, where agents learn to allocate tasks to maximize system-wide utility. We propose a novel algorithm, 'DRL-TA', which combines deep Q-networks with a graph neural network to capture the complex interactions between agents and tasks. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms traditional heuristic-based approaches in terms of task completion rate, latency, and fairness.
