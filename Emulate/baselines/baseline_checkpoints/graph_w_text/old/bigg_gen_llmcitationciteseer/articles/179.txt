Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but its accessibility for users with visual impairments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an empirical study on designing inclusive VR interfaces for visually impaired users. We conducted co-design workshops with visually impaired participants and identified key accessibility barriers in current VR systems. Based on these findings, we developed a novel VR interface that incorporates audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized font sizes. Our user study demonstrates that the proposed interface significantly improves the usability and user experience of visually impaired users in VR environments.
