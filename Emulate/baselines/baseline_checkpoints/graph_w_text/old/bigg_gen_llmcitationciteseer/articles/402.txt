Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and high-performance queries. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database state and query characteristics. Experimental results on a realistic workload demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while also reducing the number of optimization iterations.
