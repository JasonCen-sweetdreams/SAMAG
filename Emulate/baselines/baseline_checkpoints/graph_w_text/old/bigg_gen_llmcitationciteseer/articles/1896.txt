Distributed database systems are increasingly used in modern applications, but query optimization remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. We design a Markov decision process that models the query optimization problem and learn a policy using deep Q-networks. The proposed approach, called 'DQO', adaptively adjusts the query plan based on the system's workload and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that DQO outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
