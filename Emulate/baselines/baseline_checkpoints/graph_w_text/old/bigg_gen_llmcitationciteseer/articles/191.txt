Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their adoption among older adults is hindered by accessibility barriers. This study employed a participatory design approach, engaging 20 older adults in the co-design of an inclusive voice assistant. Our findings highlight the importance of customizable speech recognition, visual feedback, and multimodal input methods. We propose a set of accessibility features and guidelines for voice assistant designers, demonstrating significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates for older adults. Our work contributes to the development of more inclusive and supportive voice-based interfaces.
