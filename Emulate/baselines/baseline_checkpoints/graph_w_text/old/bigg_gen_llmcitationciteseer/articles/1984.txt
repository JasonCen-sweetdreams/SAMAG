In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that affects overall system performance. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to assign tasks to autonomous agents. Our approach, called DRL-TA, uses a multi-agent Q-network to learn the optimal task assignment policy in a distributed manner. We evaluate DRL-TA in a simulated environment and demonstrate its effectiveness in adapting to changing task requirements and agent availability. Experimental results show that DRL-TA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
