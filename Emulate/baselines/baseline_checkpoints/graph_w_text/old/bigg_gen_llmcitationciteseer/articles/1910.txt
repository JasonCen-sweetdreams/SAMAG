Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but users with visual impairments often face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive VR experiences for visually impaired users. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with visually impaired participants to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel VR framework, 'AccessibleVR', which incorporates audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized accessibility features. A user study demonstrates significant improvements in user engagement and task completion rates for visually impaired users interacting with AccessibleVR.
