Multi-agent systems require efficient task allocation mechanisms to optimize system performance. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'RL-Agent', that leverages reinforcement learning to allocate tasks to autonomous agents in real-time. RL-Agent utilizes a decentralized architecture, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on its local observations and communication with neighboring agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-Agent in a simulated warehouse environment, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
