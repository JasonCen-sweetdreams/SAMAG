The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to increased demands on network resources. This paper proposes a decentralized autonomous agent-based framework, 'DAFRA', to optimize resource allocation in IoT networks. DAFRA leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to enable agents to negotiate and allocate resources in a distributed manner. We evaluate DAFRA on a large-scale IoT testbed and demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization and network performance compared to traditional centralized approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits robustness to agent failures and adapts to dynamic network conditions.
