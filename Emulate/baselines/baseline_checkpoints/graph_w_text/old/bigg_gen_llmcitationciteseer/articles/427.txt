Real-time traffic flow prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. This paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal graph neural network (STGNN) architecture, dubbed 'TrafficFuse', which integrates graph convolutional layers with temporal attention mechanisms to model complex traffic patterns. Our approach leverages both spatial dependencies between road segments and temporal correlations in traffic flow data. Experimental results on a large-scale urban traffic dataset demonstrate that TrafficFuse outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean absolute error and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world deployment.
