As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible conversational interfaces that can accommodate the cognitive and sensory declines associated with aging. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing conversational agents that are tailored to the needs of elderly users. We conducted a series of user studies to identify the key challenges and preferences of older adults when interacting with conversational systems. Our findings inform the design of an accessible conversational interface, 'EasyChat', which incorporates features such as simplified language, visual cues, and adaptive dialogue management. A usability evaluation of EasyChat with a group of older adults demonstrates significant improvements in user engagement and task completion compared to a standard conversational interface.
