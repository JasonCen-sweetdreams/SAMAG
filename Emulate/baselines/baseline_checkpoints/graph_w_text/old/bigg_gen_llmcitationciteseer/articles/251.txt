Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents for answer extraction. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach that leverages pre-trained language models to encode documents and questions into dense vectors. Our method uses a two-stage retrieval process, where a coarse-grained retriever selects a subset of documents and a fine-grained retriever ranks the documents based on semantic similarity. Experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR outperforms state-of-the-art sparse retrieval methods, achieving a 15% increase in top-1 passage accuracy while reducing retrieval time by 30%.
