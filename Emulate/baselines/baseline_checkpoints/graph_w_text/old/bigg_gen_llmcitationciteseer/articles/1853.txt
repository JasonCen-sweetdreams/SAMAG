The proliferation of big data has led to a surge in multidimensional datasets, posing significant challenges for query optimization. This paper presents a novel hybrid indexing approach, dubbed 'FlexIndex', which combines the strengths of grid-based and tree-based indexing techniques. FlexIndex adaptively adjusts the indexing structure based on query patterns and data distribution, resulting in improved query performance and reduced storage overhead. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that FlexIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
