Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, aiming to refine user queries to better capture their search intent. Traditional methods rely on heuristic-based term selection, which often leads to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian neural network (BNN) framework for query expansion, which models the uncertainty of term importance and learns to adapt to diverse query contexts. Our approach leverages a probabilistic term weighting scheme and incorporates semantic information from word embeddings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.
