Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various industries, but existing interfaces often struggle to provide an intuitive and accessible experience for users with diverse abilities. This paper presents an embodied cognition-inspired interface design framework for VR environments, which leverages the principles of sensorimotor contingency and affordance to facilitate more natural and inclusive interaction. Our user study demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly improves task performance and user satisfaction for participants with motor impairments, paving the way for more accessible and engaging VR experiences.
