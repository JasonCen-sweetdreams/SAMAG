Individuals with visual impairments often face challenges when interacting with graphical user interfaces. This paper presents 'GazeAid', a novel gaze-informed adaptive interface that dynamically adjusts its layout and content to accommodate users' visual abilities. Our approach leverages machine learning-based gaze tracking, user profiling, and interface optimization techniques to create a more accessible and user-friendly experience. A comprehensive user study with 20 participants demonstrates that GazeAid significantly improves task completion times and user satisfaction compared to traditional interfaces.
