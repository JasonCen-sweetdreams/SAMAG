Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and high query workloads. However, optimizing query execution in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan from a set of possible plans. We evaluate RL-Opt on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
