Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current VR systems often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with varying levels of visual acuity. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and opportunities for accommodating visual impairments in VR. Our findings inform the development of 'VR-InSight', a set of guidelines and tools for creating accessible VR interfaces that leverage auditory and haptic feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VR-InSight in enhancing user experience and task performance for users with visual impairments.
