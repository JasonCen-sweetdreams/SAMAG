This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the impact of gesture-based interaction on spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills. We designed an immersive VR experience that simulates a puzzle-solving task, and participants were divided into two groups: one using gesture-based input and the other using traditional controller input. Our results show that the gesture-based group demonstrated improved spatial awareness and cognitive load management compared to the control group. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR interfaces that leverage embodied cognition principles.
