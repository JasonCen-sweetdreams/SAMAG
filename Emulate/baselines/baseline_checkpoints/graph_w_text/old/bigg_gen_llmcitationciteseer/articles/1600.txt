Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing massive networks, but efficient query processing remains a major challenge. This paper addresses the problem of range queries on graph databases, where the goal is to retrieve all nodes within a specified distance from a given node. We propose a novel indexing technique, called GRIDI, which leverages a combination of graph partitioning and hierarchical indexing to reduce query latency. Our experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GRIDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time while maintaining a comparable storage overhead.
