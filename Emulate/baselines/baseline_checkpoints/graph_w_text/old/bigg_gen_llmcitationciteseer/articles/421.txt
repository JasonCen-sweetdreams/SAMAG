In decentralized multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for optimal system performance. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We model the agent-agent interactions as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn a distributed task allocation policy. Our approach considers agent-specific capabilities, task priorities, and communication constraints. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and system efficiency.
