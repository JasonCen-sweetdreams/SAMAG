As multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for transparent and explainable decision-making processes grows. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for multi-agent decision making, which learns to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions. Our approach enables the identification of influential agents and the visualization of decision-making pathways, thereby improving the interpretability of complex multi-agent systems. Experimental results on a real-world autonomous vehicle dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in improving decision-making accuracy and providing insights into agent interactions.
