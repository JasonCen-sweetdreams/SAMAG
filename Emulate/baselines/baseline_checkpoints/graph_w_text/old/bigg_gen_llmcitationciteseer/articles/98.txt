Few-shot node classification in graph-structured data is a challenging problem due to the limited number of labeled nodes. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages the hierarchical structure of graphs to improve node representation learning. HGAT uses a two-level attention mechanism to focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs, enabling it to adapt to new classes with limited labeled data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in few-shot node classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
