Distributed relational databases are increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, query optimization in these systems is a complex problem due to the interactions between multiple nodes and the need to balance performance and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to optimize query execution plans based on feedback from the database system. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource efficiency, making it a promising solution for scalable query optimization in distributed relational databases.
