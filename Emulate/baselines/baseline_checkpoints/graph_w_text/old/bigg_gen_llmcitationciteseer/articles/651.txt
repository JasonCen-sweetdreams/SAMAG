This paper addresses the challenging problem of distributed task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have varying capabilities and tasks have different priority levels. We propose a novel decentralized algorithm, 'HeteroPri', which combines graph-based task assignment with priority-aware bidding. HeteroPri enables agents to negotiate task assignments based on their capabilities, task priorities, and communication constraints. We provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's convergence and optimality, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulations with varying agent and task configurations.
