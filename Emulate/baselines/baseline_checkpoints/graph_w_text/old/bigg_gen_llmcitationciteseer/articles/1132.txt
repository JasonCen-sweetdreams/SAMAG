Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, but users with disabilities are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to create accessible VR experiences for users with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a series of user studies and expert interviews to identify key accessibility barriers and design recommendations. Our results show that incorporating accessibility features, such as audio descriptions, sign language avatars, and customizable controls, can significantly improve the VR experience for users with disabilities.
