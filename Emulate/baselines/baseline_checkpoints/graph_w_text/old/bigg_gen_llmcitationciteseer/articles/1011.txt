In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a fundamental problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the complex relationships between agents and tasks. Our approach, called Graph-TA, uses a heterogeneous agent architecture to accommodate diverse agent capabilities and task requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Graph-TA through extensive simulations, showing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized allocation methods.
