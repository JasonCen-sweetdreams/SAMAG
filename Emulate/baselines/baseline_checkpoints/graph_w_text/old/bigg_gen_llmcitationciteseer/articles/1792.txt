Cooperative multi-agent systems require efficient task allocation mechanisms to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task assignments from agent interactions. Our approach, called GNN-TA, leverages the structural properties of the agent communication graph to predict task allocations that maximize global utility. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-TA in various scenarios, including disaster response and robotic search and rescue, and show that it outperforms existing decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to dynamic environments.
