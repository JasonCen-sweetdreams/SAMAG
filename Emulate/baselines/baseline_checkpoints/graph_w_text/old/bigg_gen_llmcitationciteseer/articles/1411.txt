Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, optimizing queries for large-scale graph databases remains a challenging task due to the exponential growth of possible query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our method, called GraphOptimizer, learns to navigate the space of possible query plans by leveraging a DRL agent that maximizes a reward function based on query execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOptimizer achieves up to 3x speedup compared to traditional optimization techniques while maintaining a high degree of accuracy.
