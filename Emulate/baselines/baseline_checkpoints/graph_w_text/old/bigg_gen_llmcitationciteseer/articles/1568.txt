As people age, cognitive impairments can significantly impact their ability to interact with technology. This paper presents a novel adaptive gesture-based interface designed to accommodate the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, using a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the effectiveness of our system. The results show that our adaptive interface, which adjusts gesture recognition thresholds and provides personalized feedback, significantly improves user performance and satisfaction compared to traditional gesture-based systems. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of accessible and inclusive HCI systems.
