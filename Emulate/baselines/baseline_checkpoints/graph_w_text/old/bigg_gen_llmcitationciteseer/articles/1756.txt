Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing methods focus on item-level explanations, neglecting the complex relationships between users and items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that captures both user-item and item-item relationships to generate personalized and interpretable recommendations. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to learn hierarchical representations of users and items, allowing for explainable recommendations based on higher-order relationships. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and providing meaningful explanations.
