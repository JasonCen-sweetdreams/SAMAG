Column-oriented NoSQL databases have gained popularity in big data analytics due to their ability to store and process large amounts of data efficiently. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization technique, 'COPT', which leverages column-level statistics and a cost-based optimization framework to minimize query latency. We evaluate COPT on a variety of workloads and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing query optimization techniques. Our results show that COPT can reduce query execution time by up to 50% while maintaining a low optimization overhead.
