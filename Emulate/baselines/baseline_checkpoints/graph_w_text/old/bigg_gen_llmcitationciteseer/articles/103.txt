Distributed database systems are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to select optimal join orders, indexing strategies, and data placement schemes. Our experiments on a realistic workload demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query execution time, while also adapting to changing workloads and system configurations.
