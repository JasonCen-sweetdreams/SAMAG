Entity retrieval is a crucial task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant entities from a large Knowledge Graph (KG) given a query. Query expansion techniques have shown promising results in improving retrieval performance. However, existing methods rely on manual feature engineering or simple graph-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach, 'GraphAttEx', which utilizes graph attention mechanisms to learn representations of query entities and their context. Our experiments on the YAGO3-10 dataset demonstrate that GraphAttEx outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and recall, while being computationally efficient.
