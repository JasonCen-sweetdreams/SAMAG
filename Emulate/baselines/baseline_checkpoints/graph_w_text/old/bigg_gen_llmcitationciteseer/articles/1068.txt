Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to improve the retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach leveraging deep neural networks. Our method, called 'NeuroQE', utilizes a transformer-based architecture to learn the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion terms. We also introduce a new training objective that incorporates both relevance and diversity metrics. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
