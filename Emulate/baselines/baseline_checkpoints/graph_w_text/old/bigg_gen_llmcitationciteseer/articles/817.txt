Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and climate science. However, existing models often struggle with long-term dependencies and high-dimensional data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that addresses these challenges. Our model employs a hierarchical structure to capture multi-scale patterns and incorporates an attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant time-series segments. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency.
