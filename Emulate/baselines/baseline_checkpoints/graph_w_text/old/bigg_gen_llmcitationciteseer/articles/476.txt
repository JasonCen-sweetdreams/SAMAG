Multi-label node classification is a fundamental problem in graph-based data analytics. Existing methods often rely on flat graph representations, neglecting the hierarchical structure inherent in many real-world networks. We propose HierGAT, a novel graph attention network that leverages hierarchical graph encodings to capture complex node relationships. HierGAT utilizes a stacked attention mechanism to adaptively focus on relevant node neighborhoods at multiple scales, resulting in improved classification performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HierGAT in capturing label correlations and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
