Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in various applications, but the lack of transparency in decision-making processes hinders its adoption in high-stakes domains. This paper presents a novel model-agnostic explainability framework, 'RL-EXPLAIN', which leverages attention mechanisms and feature importance to provide real-time explanations for DRL agents. We evaluate RL-EXPLAIN on several Atari games and a real-world autonomous driving scenario, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of DRL agents without compromising their performance.
