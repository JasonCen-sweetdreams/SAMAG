Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent in various aspects of daily life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create more inclusive conversational interfaces for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, resulting in the development of a novel conversational framework, 'CARE', which incorporates simplified language, visual cues, and error tolerance. Our evaluation with 20 participants demonstrates that CARE significantly improves interaction success and reduces user frustration compared to existing conversational interfaces.
