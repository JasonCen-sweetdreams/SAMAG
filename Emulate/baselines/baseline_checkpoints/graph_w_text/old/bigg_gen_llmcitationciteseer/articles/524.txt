Deep neural networks have revolutionized object detection tasks, but their computational complexity hinders real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian neural network pruning framework, 'BayesPrune', which exploits uncertainty estimates to identify redundant neurons and connections. By integrating a probabilistic model of network weights, BayesPrune outperforms existing pruning methods in terms of accuracy and inference speed. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate that BayesPrune reduces model size by 75% while maintaining a 95% detection accuracy, making it suitable for real-time object detection applications.
