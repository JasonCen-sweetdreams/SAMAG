Augmented reality (AR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of daily life, but its accessibility for users with visual impairments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel AR interface design that leverages haptic feedback, audio cues, and speech recognition to facilitate navigation and interaction for visually impaired users. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that our design significantly improved task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-based AR interfaces. Our findings contribute to the development of more inclusive and accessible AR experiences.
