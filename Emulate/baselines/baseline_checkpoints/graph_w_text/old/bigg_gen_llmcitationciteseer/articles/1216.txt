Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained increasing attention in recent years, but most existing methods rely on shallow feature interactions and lack transparency. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based knowledge graph embedding (HAKGE) framework that integrates symbolic and neural representations to provide interpretable explanations for recommendation results. HAKGE leverages a multi-level attention mechanism to capture complex relationships between users, items, and knowledge graph entities, and learns to generate natural language explanations for recommended items. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HAKGE in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
