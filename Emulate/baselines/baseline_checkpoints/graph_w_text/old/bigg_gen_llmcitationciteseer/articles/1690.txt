In dynamic distributed systems, efficient resource allocation is crucial for optimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach using intelligent agents to allocate resources in a decentralized, adaptive manner. Our agent-based framework, 'AURA', leverages reinforcement learning to learn the system dynamics and optimize resource allocation based on real-time performance metrics. We evaluate AURA on a simulated cloud computing environment and demonstrate improved resource utilization, reduced latency, and enhanced fault tolerance compared to traditional centralized allocation schemes.
