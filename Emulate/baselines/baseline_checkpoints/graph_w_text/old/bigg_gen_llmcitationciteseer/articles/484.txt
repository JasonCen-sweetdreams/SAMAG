Neural search has emerged as a promising approach for information retrieval, but it often suffers from the vocabulary mismatch problem. We propose a novel query expansion method, ConEx, which leverages contrastive learning to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and document keywords. ConEx uses a Siamese neural network to learn a dense representation of queries and documents, and then selects expansion terms based on their similarity to the query. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConEx outperforms existing query expansion methods, including those based on traditional lexical analysis and neural language models.
