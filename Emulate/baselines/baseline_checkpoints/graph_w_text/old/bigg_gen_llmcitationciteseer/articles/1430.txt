Conversational agents have the potential to support older adults with cognitive impairments in their daily lives. However, existing systems often fail to account for the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing inclusive conversational agents that accommodate cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, resulting in a set of design guidelines and a prototype system that uses natural language processing and machine learning to adapt to individual users' abilities. Our evaluation shows that the proposed system improves conversational interaction and task completion rates for older adults with cognitive impairments.
