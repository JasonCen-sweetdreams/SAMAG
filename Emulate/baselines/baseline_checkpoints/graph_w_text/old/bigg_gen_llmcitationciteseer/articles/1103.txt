Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the precision and recall of search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages word embeddings and reinforcement learning. Our method, 'RL-EmbExp', uses word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and generates an optimal expansion set through a reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that RL-EmbExp outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
