Graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks, but often rely on large amounts of labeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture for semi-supervised node classification. HGAT leverages attention mechanisms to selectively aggregate features from neighboring nodes at multiple scales, enabling effective information propagation in partially labeled graphs. We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating that HGAT outperforms existing graph-based methods in low-label regimes while requiring minimal additional computational overhead.
