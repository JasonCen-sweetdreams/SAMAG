Distributed database systems are increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query performance remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively tune database configurations for optimal query performance. Our RL-based optimizer, 'QueryOpt', learns to navigate the vast configuration space by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate that QueryOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of average query latency.
