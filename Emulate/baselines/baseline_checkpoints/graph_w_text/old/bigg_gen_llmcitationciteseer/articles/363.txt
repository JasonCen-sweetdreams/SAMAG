We propose a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using hierarchical reinforcement learning. Our approach enables agents to learn how to allocate tasks efficiently in a distributed manner, without relying on a centralized controller. We introduce a hierarchical framework that consists of two levels: a high-level task allocation policy and a low-level execution policy. The high-level policy learns to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities and availability, while the low-level policy learns to execute the allocated tasks. Experimental results on a multi-agent robotics platform demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
