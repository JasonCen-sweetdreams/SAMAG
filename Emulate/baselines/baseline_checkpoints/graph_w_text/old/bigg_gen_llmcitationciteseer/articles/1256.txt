Individuals with dysarthria, a motor speech disorder, often struggle with conventional voice-controlled interfaces due to speech recognition errors. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to mitigate these errors, focusing on adaptive error correction and feedback mechanisms. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 20 participants with dysarthria, analyzing their interactions with a custom-built voice-controlled system. Our results show that a combination of real-time phoneme-based error correction and auditory feedback significantly improves system usability and user satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing accessible and inclusive voice interfaces.
