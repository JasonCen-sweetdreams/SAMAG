This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, 'DRL-TA', which enables agents to learn optimal task assignment policies in a distributed manner. DRL-TA utilizes a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn task allocation policies. Experimental results on a simulated robot swarm scenario demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization. Moreover, our approach scales well to large agent teams and adapts to dynamic task environments.
