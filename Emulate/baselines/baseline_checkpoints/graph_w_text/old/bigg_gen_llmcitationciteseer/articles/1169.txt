Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to capture the underlying intent of a user's query. Traditional methods rely on term co-occurrence analysis and weighted keyword extraction. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'NeuroExpander', which leverages the strengths of neural networks to learn semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that NeuroExpander outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision and NDCG.
