This paper presents a novel gaze-based gesture recognition system for augmented reality (AR) applications using deep learning. Our approach leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify gaze patterns and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to recognize gestures from gaze data. We collected a large-scale dataset of gaze patterns from 50 participants and achieved an accuracy of 92.5% in recognizing 12 different hand gestures. The proposed system is robust to varying lighting conditions and can be integrated into AR head-mounted displays to enable intuitive user interaction.
