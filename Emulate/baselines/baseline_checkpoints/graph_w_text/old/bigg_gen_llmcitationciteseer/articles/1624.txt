In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, existing approaches often assume homogeneous agent capabilities, leading to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework, 'HeteroAssign', that accounts for heterogeneous agent capabilities and dynamic task requirements. We propose a distributed constraint optimization algorithm that leverages local search and negotiation protocols to allocate tasks while minimizing global cost functions. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HeteroAssign outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
