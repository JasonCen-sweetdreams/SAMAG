High-dimensional data often suffers from the curse of dimensionality, leading to poor performance in machine learning models. Feature selection is a crucial step to alleviate this issue, but existing methods are prone to overfitting and fail to capture complex relationships between features. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) for robust feature selection. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model feature interactions and hierarchically selects the most informative features. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art feature selection methods, achieving significant improvements in classification accuracy and robustness to noisy data.
