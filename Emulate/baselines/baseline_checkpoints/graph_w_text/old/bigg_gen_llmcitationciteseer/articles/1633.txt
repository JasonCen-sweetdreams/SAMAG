Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights. Our method utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant segments of the time series data, capturing both local and global patterns. We evaluate HAN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and interpretability.
