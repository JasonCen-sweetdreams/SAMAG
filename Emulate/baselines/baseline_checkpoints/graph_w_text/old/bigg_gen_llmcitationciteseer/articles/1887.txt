Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-based data analysis, but it remains challenging when labeled data is scarce. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) model that tackles few-shot node classification by leveraging both local and global graph structures. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to adaptively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs, enabling effective knowledge transfer from labeled to unlabeled nodes. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in node classification accuracy under few-shot settings.
