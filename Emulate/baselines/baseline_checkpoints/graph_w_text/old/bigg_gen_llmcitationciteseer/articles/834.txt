Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing interfaces often exclude this demographic due to their complex design. This paper presents the results of a user-centered design study aimed at creating inclusive VR interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops and usability evaluations with 20 older adults, resulting in the development of a novel VR interface that incorporates simplified navigation, high-contrast visual cues, and auditory feedback. Our findings show that the designed interface significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction for older adults with cognitive impairments, demonstrating the importance of inclusive design in VR development.
