In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. While graph neural networks have shown promise in modeling such interactions, they lack interpretability and transparency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent systems. HGAT combines graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical clustering to identify critical agent interactions and provide visual explanations for agent decisions. We evaluate HGAT on a real-world traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved decision accuracy and interpretability compared to existing graph neural network approaches.
