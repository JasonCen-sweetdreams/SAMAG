This study explores the role of embodied cognition in shaping user experience with gesture-based interfaces. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment involving 30 participants, using a custom-built gesture recognition system and a cognitive load assessment framework. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly influences gesture recognition accuracy, with participants exhibiting improved performance when gestures were congruent with their motor experiences. Furthermore, we found that cognitive load decreases as users become more familiar with the gesture interface. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of HCI design principles for gesture-based systems.
