Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, as it enables the incorporation of relevant terms that may not be present in the original query. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using semantic role labeling (SRL). By identifying the semantic roles played by entities in a query, our method can generate more informative and context-aware expansion terms. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, including TREC-8 and Robust-04, and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
