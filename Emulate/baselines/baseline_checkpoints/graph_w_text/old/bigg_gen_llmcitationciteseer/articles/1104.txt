In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs). Our approach leverages the hierarchical structure of task relationships to learn a distributed allocation policy. We introduce a novel graph attention mechanism that enables agents to selectively focus on relevant task dependencies. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and team efficiency.
