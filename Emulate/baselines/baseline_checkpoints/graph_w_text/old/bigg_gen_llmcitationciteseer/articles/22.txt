Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based approach, 'QNLP', which leverages the semantic capabilities of neural networks to generate context-aware query expansions. Our approach combines a transformer-based language model with a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the query expansion process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QNLP outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
