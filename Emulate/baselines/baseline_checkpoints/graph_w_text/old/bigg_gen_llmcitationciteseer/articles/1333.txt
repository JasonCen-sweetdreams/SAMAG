In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach to hierarchical task allocation, where agents are organized into clusters and tasks are allocated based on the graph structure of the system. We propose a graph convolutional network (GCN) model that learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a graph, and predicts task allocations that minimize communication overhead and maximize system performance. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in adapting to dynamic changes in the system and improving overall efficiency.
