Conventional query expansion techniques often struggle in sparse domains where relevant documents are scarce. This paper presents a neural query expansion framework, 'NQE-SD', which leverages deep learning to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. NQE-SD employs a transformer-based architecture to learn a dense representation of the query and documents, enabling more effective expansion of relevant terms. Experimental results on several sparse domain datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency compared to traditional approaches.
