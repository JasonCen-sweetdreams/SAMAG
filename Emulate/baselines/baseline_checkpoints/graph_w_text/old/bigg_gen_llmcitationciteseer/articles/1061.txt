This paper addresses the long-standing problem of ensuring transaction consistency and concurrency control in distributed database systems. We propose a novel protocol, 'CCSync', which combines a decentralized consensus mechanism with a hierarchical locking scheme to achieve high concurrency and strong consistency guarantees. Our evaluation on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrates that CCSync outperforms existing solutions in terms of throughput, latency, and fault tolerance. We also provide a theoretical analysis of CCSync's correctness and performance bounds, highlighting its applicability to a wide range of distributed database systems.
