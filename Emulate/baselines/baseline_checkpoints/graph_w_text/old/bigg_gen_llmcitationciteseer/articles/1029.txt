As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly ubiquitous, secure authentication methods are crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. This paper proposes a novel gesture-based authentication system for AR environments, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify hand gestures captured by AR device cameras. Our approach achieves a 95.6% accuracy rate on a dataset of 1,000 user gestures, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. We also conduct a comprehensive security analysis, demonstrating the resilience of our system against various attack vectors.
