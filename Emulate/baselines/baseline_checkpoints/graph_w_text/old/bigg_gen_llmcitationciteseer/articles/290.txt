Voice assistants have become increasingly popular among older adults, but their interactions often lack emotional intelligence, leading to user frustration and disengagement. This paper presents a study on designing empathetic voice assistants that can recognize and respond to older adults' emotional needs. We propose an emotional intelligence framework that incorporates affective computing, sentiment analysis, and personalized dialogue generation. Our user study with 30 older adults demonstrates that our approach significantly improves user satisfaction, trust, and emotional well-being. The findings have implications for designing more supportive and inclusive voice assistants for older adults.
