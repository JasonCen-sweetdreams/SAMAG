In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism for heterogeneous autonomous agents, where agents with different capabilities and preferences bid for tasks. We introduce a novel bidding strategy that incorporates agents' private information and a dynamic pricing mechanism that adaptively adjusts task prices based on agent bids. Our approach ensures efficient task allocation, minimizes communication overhead, and promotes fairness among agents. Experimental results on a simulated urban search and rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison to traditional centralized methods.
