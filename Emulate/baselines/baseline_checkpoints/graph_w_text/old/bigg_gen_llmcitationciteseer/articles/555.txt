Distributed task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to be assigned tasks to optimize overall system performance. This paper proposes a novel adaptive auction mechanism, 'AAMA', which dynamically adjusts auction parameters based on agent behavior and task requirements. We show that AAMA outperforms existing mechanisms in terms of allocation efficiency, fairness, and adaptability to changing system conditions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of AAMA in allocating tasks to agents with diverse skills and preferences.
