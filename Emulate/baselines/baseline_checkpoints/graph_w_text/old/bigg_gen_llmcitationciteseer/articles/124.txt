Autonomous robot navigation in complex environments remains a challenging problem. This paper presents Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Robot Navigation (HRLRN), a novel framework that leverages hierarchical abstraction to improve exploration efficiency and scalability. HRLRN uses a high-level policy to guide low-level exploration, allowing the robot to adapt to changing environments and avoid local optima. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HRLRN in simulated and real-world experiments, achieving significant improvements in navigation success rates and reduced exploration times compared to state-of-the-art methods.
