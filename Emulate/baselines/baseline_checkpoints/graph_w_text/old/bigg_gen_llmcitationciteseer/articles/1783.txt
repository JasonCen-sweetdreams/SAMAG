As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding how to design engaging and effective user experiences is crucial. This paper explores the role of personalized avatar-based representations in enhancing user engagement in VR. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, employing a mixed-methods approach to examine the effects of personalized avatars on user engagement, presence, and emotional response. Our results indicate that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, particularly among participants with high levels of self-identity. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR system design and highlight avenues for future research.
