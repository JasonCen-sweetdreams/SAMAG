Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized immersive experiences, but effective notification systems remain a challenge. This paper presents 'AdapNotif', a novel framework for designing adaptive notifications in VR. We conducted a mixed-methods study to understand user preferences and behavioral patterns in VR, and developed a machine learning model to predict optimal notification timing and modality. Our user study demonstrates that AdapNotif increases user engagement and reduces cognitive load compared to traditional notification systems, while also improving overall VR experience satisfaction.
