As distributed relational databases become increasingly prevalent, optimizing query execution plans remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans in distributed environments. We introduce a deep Q-network that learns to predict optimal query execution plans based on database statistics, query characteristics, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while maintaining robustness to changing system conditions.
