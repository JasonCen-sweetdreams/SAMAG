Multi-agent systems have become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including robotics, smart cities, and IoT. However, task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using reinforcement learning, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on its capabilities and environmental conditions. We introduce a novel reward function that incorporates agent-specific costs, task priorities, and global system efficiency. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
