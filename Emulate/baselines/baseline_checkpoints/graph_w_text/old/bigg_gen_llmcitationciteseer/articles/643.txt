Distributed query optimization is crucial for scalable cloud-native databases. This paper presents a novel join ordering algorithm, 'CloudJoin', which leverages graph-based models to efficiently explore the vast space of possible join orders. CloudJoin incorporates a probabilistic cost model that adapts to dynamic workload characteristics and varying data distributions. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world cloud-based database shows that CloudJoin outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 3.5x in terms of query execution time, while reducing optimization overhead by 2.2x.
