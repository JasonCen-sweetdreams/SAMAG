This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging auction-based mechanisms to facilitate efficient and scalable decision-making. We propose a hierarchical auction protocol that enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and availability, while incorporating a reputation system to promote trust and cooperation. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and system robustness, making it suitable for real-world applications such as disaster response and autonomous vehicles.
