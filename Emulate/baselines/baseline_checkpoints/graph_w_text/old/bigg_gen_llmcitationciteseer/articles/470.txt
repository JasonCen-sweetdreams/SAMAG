Few-shot node classification is a challenging task in graph-structured data, where only a few labeled nodes are available for training. We propose a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both node and graph-level attention mechanisms to learn robust representations. HGAT consists of a node encoder that captures local structural information and a graph encoder that aggregates node features using attention weights. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, especially when the number of labeled nodes is extremely limited.
