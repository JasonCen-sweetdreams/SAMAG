In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task allocation policies. We model the agent-agent interactions as a graph and leverage GNNs to capture the structural dependencies between agents. Our approach, called GTX-Allocate, learns to allocate tasks by predicting the optimal assignment of agents to tasks based on their capabilities and the task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that GTX-Allocate outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
