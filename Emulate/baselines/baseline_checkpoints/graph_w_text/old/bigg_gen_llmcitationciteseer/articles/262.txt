As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding how users interact with virtual environments is crucial for designing intuitive and immersive experiences. This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in VR, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, comparing gesture-based interaction with traditional controller-based interaction in a virtual museum setting. Our results show that gesture-based interaction enhances user engagement, recall, and overall experience, with significant implications for VR-based applications in education, training, and entertainment.
