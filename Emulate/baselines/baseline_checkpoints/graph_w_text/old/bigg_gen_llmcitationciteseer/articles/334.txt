Emotion recognition from multimodal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and time segments to recognize emotions. Our HAN model consists of three levels of attention: modality-level, segment-level, and token-level. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.3% in terms of weighted F1-score, achieving a new benchmark for multimodal emotion recognition.
