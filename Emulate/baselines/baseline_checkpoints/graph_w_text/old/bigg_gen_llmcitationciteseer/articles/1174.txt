Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in node classification tasks, but often struggle with scalability and hierarchical dependencies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, 'HAGNN', which leverages multi-scale graph attention to capture both local and global node relationships. We introduce a hierarchical aggregation mechanism that adaptively weights attention coefficients across different graph scales, enabling more accurate node representations. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in node classification tasks, while exhibiting improved computational efficiency.
