Conversational interfaces are increasingly being used to support older adults in their daily lives. However, the cognitive demands of voice-based interactions can be overwhelming, leading to errors and frustration. This study employs a mixed-methods approach to examine the cognitive load experienced by older adults when using voice-based conversational interfaces. We conducted a series of user studies with 30 participants aged 65-85, using a novel cognitive load assessment framework. Results show that older adults experience significant cognitive load due to linguistic and semantic complexities, and that this load can be mitigated through the use of simplified language and visual feedback. Implications for the design of accessible conversational interfaces are discussed.
