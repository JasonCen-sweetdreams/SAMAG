Distributed database systems face significant challenges in optimizing query performance, particularly in dynamic and heterogeneous environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select optimal query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving feedback in the form of query execution times. Our approach, called 'RL-QOpt', incorporates a hierarchical exploration strategy that balances query optimization and exploration of the state space. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that RL-QOpt achieves significant performance improvements over traditional query optimization techniques, with average query execution time reductions of up to 35%.
