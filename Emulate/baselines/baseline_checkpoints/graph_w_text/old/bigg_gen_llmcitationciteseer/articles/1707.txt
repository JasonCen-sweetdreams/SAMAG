Voice assistants have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing systems often fail to account for their unique needs and abilities. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyVoice', a voice assistant tailored to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to inform the design of EasyVoice, which incorporates simplified language processing, personalized feedback mechanisms, and adaptive error correction. Our results show that EasyVoice significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in HCI.
