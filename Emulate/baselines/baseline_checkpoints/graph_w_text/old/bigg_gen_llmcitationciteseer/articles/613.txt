Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the most efficient query plan based on the system's current workload and resource utilization. Our experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by reducing query execution times by up to 30%.
