In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have varying capabilities and resources. Our approach leverages a novel auction-based mechanism, which incorporates a probabilistic task assignment strategy to ensure efficient and fair allocation. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized task allocation methods. The proposed framework is particularly suited for applications in search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and smart cities.
