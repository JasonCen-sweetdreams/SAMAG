Conversational interfaces have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but their adoption by older adults remains limited. This study explores the design of accessible voice-controlled smart home systems for older adults, focusing on improving usability, accessibility, and user experience. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, identifying key challenges and opportunities for design innovation. Our findings inform the development of a novel conversational interface framework, 'ElderVoice', which incorporates age-related design considerations, multimodal feedback, and personalized assistance. A usability evaluation of ElderVoice demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction among older adults.
