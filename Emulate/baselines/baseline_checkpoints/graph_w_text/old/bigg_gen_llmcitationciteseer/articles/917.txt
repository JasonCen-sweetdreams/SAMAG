Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This study investigates the design of inclusive voice assistants that accommodate the unique needs of this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant framework, 'CARE', which incorporates personalized dialogue management, error tolerance, and multimodal feedback. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
