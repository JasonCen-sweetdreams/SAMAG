As data volumes continue to grow, optimizing query performance in distributed database systems becomes increasingly crucial. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing technique that dynamically adjusts indexing strategies based on query workload and data distribution. We introduce a novel cost model that accurately estimates the benefits of indexing for varying query patterns and data skews. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance compared to traditional static indexing methods, while minimizing index maintenance overhead.
