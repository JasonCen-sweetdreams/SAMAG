Dense passage indexing has revolutionized the field of information retrieval by enabling efficient and accurate passage retrieval. However, the effectiveness of these models still relies heavily on the quality of the input query. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework, 'NQE- DPI', that leverages BERT-based language models to expand the input query and improve the retrieval performance. Our approach uses a novel attention mechanism to focus on the most informative tokens in the query and generates a set of related queries that can be efficiently indexed using existing dense passage indexing methods. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQE-DPI achieves significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
