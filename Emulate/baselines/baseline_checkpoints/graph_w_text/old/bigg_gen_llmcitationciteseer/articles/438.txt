Virtual reality (VR) has become an increasingly popular platform for entertainment, education, and social interaction. This study examines the effect of personalized avatar appearance on user engagement in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR game using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, including increased time spent in the game and improved task performance. We also found that users with personalized avatars reported higher levels of self-presence and enjoyment. Our findings have implications for the design of VR experiences, suggesting that personalized avatars can enhance user engagement and overall experience.
