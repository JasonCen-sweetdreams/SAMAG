In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. Our approach represents the agent-task graph as a dynamic neural network, where agents and tasks are nodes, and edges represent feasibility and priority constraints. We develop a distributed GNN algorithm that allows agents to learn and adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and communication overhead.
