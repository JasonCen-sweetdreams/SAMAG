In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper introduces a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach, called 'MALTA', uses a distributed deep Q-network to learn the optimal task allocation policy for each agent, taking into account the agents' capabilities, task requirements, and environmental constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MALTA outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and adaptability to changing environments.
