Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and provide high performance. However, query optimization remains a challenging problem in such systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
