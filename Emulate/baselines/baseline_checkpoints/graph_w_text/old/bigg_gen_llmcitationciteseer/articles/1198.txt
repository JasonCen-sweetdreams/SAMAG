Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they enable users to understand the reasoning behind recommended items. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that learns to generate interpretable recommendations by modeling user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph. Our approach incorporates attention mechanisms at both the user and item levels, allowing the model to selectively focus on relevant features and relationships. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and providing explainable recommendations.
