Distributed databases are increasingly used in modern applications, but query performance often suffers due to data replication and consistency issues. This paper presents a novel adaptive replication algorithm, 'DynaRep', which dynamically adjusts data placement and replication based on query patterns and workload characteristics. Our approach leverages machine learning techniques to predict query hotspots and optimize data distribution, resulting in significant improvements in query response times and system throughput. We evaluate DynaRep on a real-world e-commerce dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing query latency by up to 45% compared to traditional static replication schemes.
