As data warehousing applications continue to generate massive amounts of data, the need for efficient query processing has become increasingly important. This paper explores the use of column-oriented storage for real-time data warehousing, focusing on optimizing query performance. We propose a novel indexing technique, 'ColIndex', which leverages the columnar structure to accelerate query execution. Our approach combines a hybrid indexing strategy with a cost-based optimizer to minimize query latency. Experimental results using the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional row-oriented storage, making our approach suitable for real-time analytics and business intelligence applications.
