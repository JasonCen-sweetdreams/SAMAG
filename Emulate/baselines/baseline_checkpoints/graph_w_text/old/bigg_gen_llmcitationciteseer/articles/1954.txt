Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) encompass diverse entity types and relationships, making node classification a challenging task. This paper proposes HierGAT, a novel hierarchical graph attention network that captures complex dependencies between nodes and their attributes. By integrating local and global attention mechanisms, HierGAT learns to focus on relevant node features and their contextual relationships. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HierGAT on several real-world HIN datasets, showcasing improved classification accuracy and interpretability through visualization of attention weights. Our approach has implications for explainable AI in domains like social network analysis and recommender systems.
