Document clustering is a fundamental task in information retrieval, but traditional methods often struggle with scalability and semantic understanding. This paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Graph Neural Network Clustering (HGNClust), which leverages graph neural networks to model document relationships and hierarchically cluster them. By incorporating document syntax and semantics, HGNClust achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, outperforming traditional methods in terms of clustering quality and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGNClust in real-world information retrieval applications, such as document recommendation and search result grouping.
