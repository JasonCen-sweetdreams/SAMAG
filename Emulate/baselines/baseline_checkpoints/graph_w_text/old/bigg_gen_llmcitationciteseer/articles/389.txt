Distributed databases are increasingly used in modern data analytics, but optimizing complex queries remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for join reordering, which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to minimize communication costs. Our method, called 'GraphJoin', constructs a hierarchical graph representation of the query plan and applies a set of rules to recursively reorder joins. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark show that GraphJoin outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3.5x in terms of query execution time, while reducing network communication by 40%
