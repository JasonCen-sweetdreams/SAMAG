Query optimization is a crucial component of database systems, particularly in distributed settings where data is scattered across multiple nodes. Traditional optimization techniques often rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, which may not be effective in today's complex and dynamic environments. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to query optimization, where an RL agent learns to navigate the query optimization space and adapts to changing data distributions and system workloads. We propose a novel RL framework, 'RL-Opt', which incorporates a graph-based representation of query plans and leverages deep Q-networks to learn optimal query execution strategies. Experimental results on a simulated distributed database system demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
