Decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in scenarios where agents have limited communication and computation capabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn decentralized task allocation policies. Our approach, called GraphTask, represents the agent-task graph as a neural network and trains it to optimize task allocation using a reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that GraphTask outperforms traditional decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion rate, latency, and robustness to agent failures.
