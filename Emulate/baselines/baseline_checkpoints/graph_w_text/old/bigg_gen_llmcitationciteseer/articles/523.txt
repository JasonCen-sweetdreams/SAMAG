Semantic search has become increasingly important in modern information retrieval systems. However, optimizing queries over large knowledge graphs remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'KGEMO', which leverages knowledge graph embeddings to efficiently identify relevant semantic entities. We develop a probabilistic modeling approach that captures the uncertainty of entity relationships, enabling effective pruning of irrelevant query results. Experimental evaluation on popular benchmark datasets demonstrates that KGEMO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
