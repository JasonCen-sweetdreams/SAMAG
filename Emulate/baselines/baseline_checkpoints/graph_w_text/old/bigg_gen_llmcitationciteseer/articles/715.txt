Traditional document retrieval systems rely on hand-crafted features and ranking models, which often fail to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper presents DeepRank, a neural re-ranking model that leverages pre-trained language models and a novel attention-based mechanism to improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepRank outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, while reducing computational overhead by up to 30%. We also provide insights into the interpretability of DeepRank's ranking decisions using visualizations and feature importance analysis.
