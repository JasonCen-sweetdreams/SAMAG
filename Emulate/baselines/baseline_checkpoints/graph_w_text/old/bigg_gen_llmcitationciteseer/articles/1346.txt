Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but designing effective gestural interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in VR, investigating how gestural interfaces can be optimized to enhance user engagement and immersion. We present a novel framework, 'GestureFlow', which incorporates kinesthetic and proprioceptive feedback to improve gesture recognition and reduce cognitive load. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that GestureFlow significantly increases user engagement and reduces fatigue compared to traditional controller-based interfaces.
