The proliferation of fake news on social media has severe consequences for individuals and society. Existing detection methods struggle to capture the complex relationships between modalities such as text, images, and user metadata. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that integrates multi-modal features into a unified graph representation. HGAT employs self-attention mechanisms to adaptively weigh the importance of each modality and node, enabling the detection of subtle patterns indicative of fake news. Our experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.1% in F1-score, with significant improvements in detecting fake news with multimedia content.
