In multi-agent systems, decision-making involves complex interactions and dependencies among agents. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in such settings. Our approach incorporates attention mechanisms at both the agent and system levels, allowing the model to selectively focus on relevant interactions and dependencies. We evaluate our approach on a real-world Autonomous Vehicle (AV) scenario, demonstrating improved decision-making accuracy and interpretability compared to existing methods. The proposed HAN framework has broad implications for the development of more transparent and trustworthy multi-agent systems.
