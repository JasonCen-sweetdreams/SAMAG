Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize query plans based on graph structural features and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
