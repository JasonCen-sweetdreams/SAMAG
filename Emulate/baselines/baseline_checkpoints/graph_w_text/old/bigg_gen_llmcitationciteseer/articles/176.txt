Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but current interfaces often rely on abstract controllers that fail to leverage the richness of human embodiment. This paper presents a study on gesture-based interaction in VR, exploring how bodily experiences shape cognitive processes. We designed an immersive VR environment that incorporates gesture recognition, tactile feedback, and proprioceptive cues to facilitate embodied cognition. Our results show that users exhibit improved spatial reasoning, working memory, and creativity when interacting with virtual objects using gestures, as compared to traditional controller-based methods.
