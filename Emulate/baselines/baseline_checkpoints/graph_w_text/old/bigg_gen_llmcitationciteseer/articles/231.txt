Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but user experience is often compromised by high cognitive load. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effects of cognitive load on user performance and satisfaction in VR environments. We designed a novel experiment using a custom-built VR platform, where participants performed tasks with varying levels of complexity. Our results show that high cognitive load significantly impairs user performance, reduces satisfaction, and increases mental fatigue. We also identify key design factors that contribute to cognitive load and provide guidelines for VR interface designers to create more user-centered experiences.
