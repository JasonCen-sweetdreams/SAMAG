Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using graph-based models, which capture complex dependencies between query components. We introduce a hierarchical graph representation that enables efficient identification of optimization opportunities, and develop a cost-based optimization algorithm that leverages graph traversal techniques. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional optimization methods, with an average query response time reduction of 37%.
