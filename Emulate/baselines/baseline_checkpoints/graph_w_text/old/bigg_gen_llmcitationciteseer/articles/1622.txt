Main-memory databases have revolutionized real-time data processing, but efficient indexing remains a major challenge for time-series data. This paper presents 'TSI-Hash', a novel indexing technique that leverages the properties of time-series data to reduce memory footprint and improve query performance. TSI-Hash combines a hierarchical hash structure with a probabilistic sampling approach to enable fast range queries and aggregates. Experimental evaluation on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrates that TSI-Hash outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in memory efficiency.
