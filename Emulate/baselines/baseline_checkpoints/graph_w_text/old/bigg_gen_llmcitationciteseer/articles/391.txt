This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for coordinated route planning in autonomous vehicle systems. We propose a decentralized framework, 'MARLP', where each vehicle is modeled as an autonomous agent that learns to optimize its route in real-time based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. Our approach utilizes a hierarchical deep Q-network architecture to balance individual vehicle goals with global system objectives. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in overall system efficiency, reduced congestion, and enhanced safety compared to traditional, centralized route planning methods.
