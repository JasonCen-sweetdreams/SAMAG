Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages machine learning and graph-theoretic techniques to identify efficient query plans. We introduce a graph neural network-based approach to predict query execution costs and a novel cost-aware query decomposition strategy to minimize communication overhead. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt reduces query execution times by up to 3.5x compared to existing optimization techniques.
