In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents to maximize overall system efficiency. This paper presents a decentralized coalition formation approach, called DACF, which enables agents to form coalitions and allocate tasks without relying on a centralized controller. DACF uses a distributed constraint optimization framework to model the task allocation problem and applies a novel consensus-based protocol to facilitate coalition formation. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that DACF outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of system throughput and fairness.
