Ad-hoc search is a fundamental task in information retrieval (IR), where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. This paper presents a novel deep neural ranking model, 'DNR-Adhoc', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture contextual relationships between query terms and document contents. We propose a new training objective that combines both relevance and diversity signals to improve the ranking quality. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DNR-Adhoc outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness.
