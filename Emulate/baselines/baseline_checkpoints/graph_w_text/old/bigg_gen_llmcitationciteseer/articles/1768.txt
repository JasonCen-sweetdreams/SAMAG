Document filtering is a crucial task in information retrieval, where the goal is to filter out irrelevant documents from a large corpus. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features or keyword matching, which can be ineffective for complex queries. We propose a novel neural retrieval network, Hierarchical Document Filter (HDF), which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to model document structures and relevance. HDF outperforms state-of-the-art filtering methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving a 23% relative improvement in precision at top-10 ranks. We also demonstrate the scalability of HDF on a large-scale dataset with over 1 million documents.
