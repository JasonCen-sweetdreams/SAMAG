Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly prevalent in modern data management, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design a RL framework, 'QOPT', that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment. QOPT leverages a combination of exploration strategies and a reward function that balances query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that QOPT outperforms traditional optimization techniques, achieving up to 30% reduction in query latency and 25% improvement in resource efficiency.
