Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in sentiment analysis tasks, but their lack of interpretability hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms at both sentence and document levels to provide insights into the decision-making process. Our approach leverages AI-driven feature extraction and incorporates domain knowledge to improve model explainability. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HAN model in achieving high accuracy while providing transparent and interpretable sentiment analysis.
