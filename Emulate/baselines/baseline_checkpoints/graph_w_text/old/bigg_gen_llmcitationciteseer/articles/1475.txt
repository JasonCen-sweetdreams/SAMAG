In multi-agent systems, decision-making often involves complex interactions between agents with varying goals and preferences. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in such systems. HAN exploits attention mechanisms to model agent interactions and recursively composes attention weights to capture hierarchical relationships. We evaluate HAN on a simulated multi-agent task allocation problem, demonstrating improved decision-making performance and interpretable attention patterns that provide insights into agent interactions and decision processes.
