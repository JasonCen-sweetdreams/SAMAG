Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are increasingly used in large-scale search engines and data analytics applications. However, query processing in DIR systems remains a bottleneck due to the high latency and communication overhead of indexing and retrieval. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the strengths of centralized and distributed indexing techniques. Our approach, called 'HybridIndex', leverages a centralized broker to manage metadata and coordinate query processing, while distributing the indexing and retrieval tasks across a cluster of nodes. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HybridIndex reduces query latency by up to 50% and improves retrieval efficiency by up to 30% compared to existing distributed indexing approaches.
