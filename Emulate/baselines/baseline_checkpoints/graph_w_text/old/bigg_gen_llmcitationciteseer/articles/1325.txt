Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of personalized experiences. This paper presents a user study that investigates the effects of personalization on user experience in VR. We developed a VR system that adapts to individual users' preferences, interests, and abilities, and evaluated its impact on user engagement, satisfaction, and cognitive load. Our results show that personalization significantly improves user experience, but its effectiveness is influenced by factors such as user personality and familiarity with VR technology.
