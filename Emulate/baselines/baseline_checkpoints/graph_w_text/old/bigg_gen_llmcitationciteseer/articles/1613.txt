Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, query optimization for distributed graph databases remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, subquery rewriting, and parallel query execution to achieve scalability and efficiency. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in query response time and 5x in throughput.
