The growing adoption of voice assistants has led to a significant increase in older adults' interaction with conversational systems. However, the usability of these systems for this demographic remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the design requirements for inclusive conversational interfaces tailored to older adults' needs. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise language, flexible turn-taking, and explicit error handling. We propose a set of design guidelines and evaluate their effectiveness through a usability study with 30 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
