Large-scale information retrieval systems often struggle to efficiently retrieve relevant documents from massive indexes. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, ProximalRank, which leverages a proximal optimization algorithm to learn a compact and effective ranking function. By approximating the optimum ranking function using a neural network, ProximalRank achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art ranking accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ProximalRank in reducing computational overhead and improving query response times.
