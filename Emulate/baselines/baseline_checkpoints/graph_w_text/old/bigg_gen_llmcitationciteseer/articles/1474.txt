Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CAREVoice', a novel voice assistant framework that incorporates cognitive support features to facilitate independent living. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 20 older adults with mild cognitive impairments, revealing that CAREVoice's personalized prompts, multimodal feedback, and error tolerance features significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and supportive voice assistants for this underserved population.
