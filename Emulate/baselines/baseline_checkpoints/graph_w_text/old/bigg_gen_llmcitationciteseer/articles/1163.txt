The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in smart grids necessitates efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper proposes a multi-agent system, 'SmartAllocator', which coordinates autonomous agents to optimize energy distribution in real-time. We develop a novel auction-based mechanism that leverages machine learning to predict energy demand and supply, enabling agents to adapt to changing grid conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that SmartAllocator reduces energy losses by 15% and peak demand by 20% compared to traditional approaches, while ensuring scalability and flexibility in dynamically changing environments.
