Older adults with dementia face significant challenges when interacting with digital systems, often relying on caregivers for assistance. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyGest', a gesture-based interface tailored to the needs of older adults with dementia. EasyGest incorporates simple, intuitive gestures and provides real-time feedback to facilitate learning and use. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating improved interaction performance and reduced caregiver involvement. Our findings inform the development of accessible, gesture-based interfaces that can promote independence and quality of life for older adults with dementia.
