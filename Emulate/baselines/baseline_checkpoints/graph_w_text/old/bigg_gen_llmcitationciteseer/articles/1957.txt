Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with hearing impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice-based interfaces that cater to this underserved population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and audiologists to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel auditory feedback mechanism, 'EchoGuide', which utilizes multimodal cues and personalized audio processing to enhance speech recognition and comprehension. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
