This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. We model the agent communication graph as a dynamic, heterogeneous network and employ a GNN-based policy to assign tasks to agents based on their capabilities and local observations. Our approach enables adaptive, real-time allocation in the face of changing task requirements and agent availability. Experiments on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional, centralized allocation methods.
