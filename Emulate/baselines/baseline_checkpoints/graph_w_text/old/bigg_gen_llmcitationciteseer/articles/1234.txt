Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to provide emotional support and companionship to patients in healthcare settings. However, designing ECAs that can empathize and respond appropriately to patients' emotional cues remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an ECA framework that integrates emotional intelligence (EI) and affective computing to recognize and respond to patients' emotions. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that our ECA significantly improved patients' self-reported emotional comfort and reduced anxiety levels compared to a baseline ECA without EI. Our results have implications for the development of emotionally intelligent ECAs in healthcare support.
