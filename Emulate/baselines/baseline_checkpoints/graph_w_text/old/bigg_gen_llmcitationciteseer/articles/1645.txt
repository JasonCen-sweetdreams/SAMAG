Multi-tenant database systems (MTDS) are increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We develop an RL agent that learns to select optimal query plans based on workload patterns, resource utilization, and query characteristics. Our evaluation on a real-world MTDS shows that the RL-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query latency and resource efficiency.
