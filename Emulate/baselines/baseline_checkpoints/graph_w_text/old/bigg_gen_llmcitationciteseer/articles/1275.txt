In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a fundamental problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We develop a novel algorithm, 'Distributed Task Allocation using DCOP' (DTA-DCOP), which leverages the strengths of both DCOP and multi-agent systems. Our approach enables agents to exchange information and negotiate tasks in a decentralized manner, resulting in improved system efficiency and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DTA-DCOP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task allocation quality and communication overhead.
