Real-time data warehousing is crucial for decision-making in various industries. However, optimizing queries in such systems is challenging due to the high volume and velocity of data. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize query execution plans in real-time data warehousing. Our DRL model, 'QueryOpt', learns to select the most efficient execution plan based on the query workload and system resources. We evaluate QueryOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
