In multi-agent systems, trust is a crucial factor in decision-making and cooperation. However, trust relationships can evolve over time due to changing agent behaviors or environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive trust revision using reinforcement learning. Our method, called ART, learns to adjust trust levels based on observed agent interactions and rewards. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ART in a simulated environment, showing improved cooperation and reduced conflicts compared to traditional trust models. The results have implications for the design of more resilient and efficient multi-agent systems.
