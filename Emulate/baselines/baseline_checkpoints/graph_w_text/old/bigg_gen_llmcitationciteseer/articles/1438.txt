Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization, which leverages graph neural networks to model the query plan space and optimize the execution plan. Our approach, called 'GraphQP', is able to reduce the query execution time by up to 30% compared to traditional query optimization techniques. We evaluate GraphQP on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in various scenarios.
