This paper presents a novel real-time object detection framework, 'TransDet', designed for autonomous vehicles. We leverage the strengths of transformer-based architectures and propose an efficient attention mechanism that reduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI dataset, with an average precision of 95.2% at 30 FPS. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of TransDet on a real-world autonomous driving platform, showcasing its potential for deployment in safety-critical applications.
