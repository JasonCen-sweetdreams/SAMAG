Column-store databases have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents 'CQTune', a novel framework that leverages machine learning and statistical modeling to optimize query execution plans. CQTune adaptively tunes query parameters based on workload characteristics, data distributions, and system resources. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that CQTune achieves an average speedup of 3.2x over state-of-the-art query optimizers, while reducing query latency by up to 75%
