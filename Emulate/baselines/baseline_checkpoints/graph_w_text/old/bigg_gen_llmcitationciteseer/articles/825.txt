Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, as it resolves ambiguities in entity references. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach, 'HierAtt', which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to disambiguate entities in knowledge graph embeddings. We propose a multi-level attention framework that captures both local and global contextual information, enabling the model to distinguish between ambiguous entities. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierAtt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of disambiguation accuracy and knowledge graph quality.
