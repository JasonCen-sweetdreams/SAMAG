Optimizing queries for multi-dimensional data is a crucial task in database systems. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on hand-crafted heuristics or exhaustive search, which can be suboptimal and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for multi-dimensional data. Our method, called 'DeepQOpt', uses a neural network to learn a policy that selects the optimal join order and indexing strategy for a given query. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and 2x in terms of memory usage.
