Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when query terms are ambiguous or context-dependent. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages context-aware embeddings to better capture the semantic relationships between query terms and document content. Our method, dubbed 'CAQE', uses a graph-based attention mechanism to incorporate contextual information from surrounding terms and concepts, resulting in more effective query expansion and improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on several standard ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of CAQE over state-of-the-art methods.
