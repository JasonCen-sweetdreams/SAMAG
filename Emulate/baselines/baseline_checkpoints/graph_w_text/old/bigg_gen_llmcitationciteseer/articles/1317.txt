Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to reformulate the original query to better capture the user's intent. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted rules and thesauri, which often fail to generalize across diverse domains. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach, 'NeuroQE', that leverages neural networks to learn query expansion from large-scale clickthrough data. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for ambiguous and underspecified queries. We also show that NeuroQE can be effectively integrated with existing IR systems, leading to more accurate and relevant search results.
