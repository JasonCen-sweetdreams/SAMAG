Real-time data warehousing requires efficient query optimization to support timely decision-making. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to predict optimal query plans. Our method, 'RTOptimizer', uses a graph neural network to model the query optimization space and a reinforcement learning framework to learn from past query executions. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that RTOptimizer reduces query latency by up to 40% compared to traditional rule-based optimizers while maintaining comparable accuracy.
