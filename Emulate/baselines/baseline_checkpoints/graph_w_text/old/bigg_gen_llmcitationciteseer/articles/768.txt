Voice assistants have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults, but existing systems often fail to account for age-related cognitive and physical impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing inclusive voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and design requirements, and then developed a prototype system incorporating features such as slowdown speech, multimodal input, and personalized prompts. Our evaluation results show significant improvements in usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
