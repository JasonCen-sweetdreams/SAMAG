Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often suffer from vocabulary mismatch between the query and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, NeuralExp, which leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method uses a graph convolutional network to learn term representations from a large corpus, and then selects expansion terms based on their proximity to the query terms in the embedding space. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that NeuralExp outperforms traditional query expansion methods, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
