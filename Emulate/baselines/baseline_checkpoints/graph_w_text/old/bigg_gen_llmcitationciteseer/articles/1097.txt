This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have different capabilities and tasks have varying requirements. We propose a decentralized auction-based mechanism, called HeteroAuction, which enables agents to bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. HeteroAuction uses a novel bidding strategy that incorporates task dependencies and agent capabilities, and a distributed auction protocol that ensures efficient allocation of tasks. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that HeteroAuction outperforms existing centralized and decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency.
