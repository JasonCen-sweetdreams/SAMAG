In complex multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective objectives. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HRL-MA', that enables agents to adaptively allocate tasks in dynamic environments. Our approach leverages a two-level hierarchy, where high-level agents coordinate task assignments and low-level agents learn to execute tasks via deep Q-networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HRL-MA in a simulated disaster response scenario, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional decentralized approaches.
