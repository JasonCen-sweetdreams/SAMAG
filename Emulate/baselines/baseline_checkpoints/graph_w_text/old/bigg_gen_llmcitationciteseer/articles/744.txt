Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process of AI-driven systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for ERS, which leverages both item-level and user-level attention mechanisms to generate personalized explanations. Our approach incorporates a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes recommendation accuracy and explanation quality. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of both accuracy and explanation fidelity.
