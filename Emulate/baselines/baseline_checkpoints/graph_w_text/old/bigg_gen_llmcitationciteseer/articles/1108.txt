Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often suffer from vocabulary mismatch between the query and relevant documents. Query expansion techniques can alleviate this issue, but traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well. We propose a neural query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. NeuroQE uses a novel attention mechanism to weigh the importance of expansion terms and integrates with a ranking model to re-rank the retrieved documents. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset show that NeuroQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
