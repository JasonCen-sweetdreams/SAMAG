Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their adoption among older adults remains limited due to accessibility barriers. This study investigates the design of inclusive voice assistants that accommodate the unique needs of older adults. We conducted a multimodal interaction study with 30 older adults, exploring the effects of speech rate, tone, and visual feedback on user experience. Our results show that personalized speech rate adjustment and empathetic tone significantly improve task completion rates and user satisfaction. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating more inclusive voice assistants and discuss the implications for promoting digital inclusion among older adults.
