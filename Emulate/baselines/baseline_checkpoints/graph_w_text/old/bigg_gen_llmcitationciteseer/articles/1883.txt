Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but the role of embodied cognition in shaping user experience remains understudied. This paper investigates the impact of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load, user engagement, and task performance in VR environments. We designed a series of experiments using a custom-built VR platform, where participants performed tasks that required varying levels of gestural input. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly influences user performance, with gesture-based interaction reducing cognitive load and improving task accuracy. The findings have implications for the design of VR systems that leverage embodied cognition to enhance user experience.
