This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We investigate how users' bodily experiences influence their problem-solving abilities and cognitive load in VR. Our study employs a novel gesture-based interface, 'Embodime', which allows users to manipulate virtual objects using natural hand and arm movements. Results show that Embodime significantly improves task performance and reduces cognitive load compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. Furthermore, we find that users' self-reported sense of embodiment is strongly correlated with their performance and cognitive load. Our findings have implications for the design of intuitive and effective VR interfaces.
