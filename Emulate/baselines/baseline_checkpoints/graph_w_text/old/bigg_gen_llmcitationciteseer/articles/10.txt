This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for multi-agent dialogue systems, enabling explainable and efficient decision-making in complex dialogue scenarios. Our HAN model integrates attention mechanisms at both the utterance and dialogue levels, allowing agents to selectively focus on relevant contextual information. We evaluate our approach on a real-world dialogue dataset, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we propose a novel explainability metric, 'Dialogue Attention Score', to quantify the degree of attention assigned to each utterance, providing valuable insights into agent decision-making processes.
