Time-series data indexing is crucial for efficient query processing in various applications. This paper presents a novel indexing approach based on Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA), which reduces the dimensionality of time-series data while preserving its essential features. Our proposed index, called PAA-Tree, uses a combination of PAA and a hierarchical tree structure to support fast range and k-nearest neighbor queries. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that PAA-Tree outperforms existing indexing techniques in terms of query performance and storage efficiency.
