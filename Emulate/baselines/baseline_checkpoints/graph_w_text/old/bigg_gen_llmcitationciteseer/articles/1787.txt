This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation in dynamic environments using multi-agent reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'MA-RTL', that enables agents to learn and adapt to changing environmental conditions and task requirements. Our approach utilizes a hybrid reward function that balances individual agent objectives with global team performance, ensuring efficient task allocation and execution. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MA-RTL in simulated scenarios, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
