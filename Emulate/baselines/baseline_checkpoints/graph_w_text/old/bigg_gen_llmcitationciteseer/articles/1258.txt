In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn complex agent interactions. Our approach, called 'TaskGNN', models the agent communication graph and learns to predict task assignments based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and environmental constraints. We evaluate TaskGNN on a series of simulated robot navigation tasks and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional optimization-based methods.
