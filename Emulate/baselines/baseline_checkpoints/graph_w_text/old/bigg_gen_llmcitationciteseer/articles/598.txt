Ad-hoc search systems struggle to retrieve relevant passages efficiently, particularly when dealing with long documents and complex queries. This paper proposes a novel query-driven deep learning approach, 'PassageNet', which leverages a hierarchical neural network to model passage relevance and query-passage interactions. By incorporating a passage ranking module and a query-dependent attention mechanism, PassageNet significantly outperforms traditional retrieval methods in terms of both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving passage retrieval for ad-hoc search.
