Multi-agent systems require effective decision-making strategies that balance individual and collective goals. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision-making. Our approach integrates graph attention mechanisms to model inter-agent relationships and hierarchical attention to focus on critical agents and subtasks. We demonstrate the superiority of HAN over existing methods on a benchmark dataset, achieving improved decision quality and interpretability. The proposed framework has applications in autonomous systems, smart cities, and human-robot collaboration.
