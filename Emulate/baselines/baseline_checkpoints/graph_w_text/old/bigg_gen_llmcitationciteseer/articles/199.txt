Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the varying importance of different modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that selectively focuses on relevant modalities and time segments to improve recognition accuracy and efficiency. Our HAN model consists of two stages: a modality attention layer that weights the importance of each modality, and a temporal attention layer that identifies critical time segments. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of emotion recognition accuracy and inference speed.
