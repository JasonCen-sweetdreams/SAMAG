Graph-based recommendation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various domains, but their black-box nature limits their interpretability. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms at both node and graph levels to generate explainable recommendations. Our approach leverages graph convolutional layers to learn node representations and hierarchical attention to capture complex relationships between nodes. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms existing graph-based models while providing visual explanations for the recommended items.
