Task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, particularly in dynamic environments where agent capabilities and task requirements change over time. This paper introduces a hybrid agent-based framework that combines the strengths of centralized and decentralized approaches to achieve efficient task allocation. Our framework leverages a novel task representation scheme and a distributed constraint optimization algorithm to enable adaptive task allocation in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to existing approaches in various dynamic scenarios.
