Virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) have become increasingly popular, but their security remains a major concern. We present a novel gaze-based authentication system, 'GazeSecure', which leverages the unique characteristics of HMDs to provide robust and user-friendly authentication. GazeSecure uses a combination of eye-tracking and machine learning to identify users based on their gaze patterns, achieving an accuracy of 95.2% in a real-world study with 50 participants. Our system is resistant to various types of attacks, including spoofing and shoulder surfing, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VR applications.
