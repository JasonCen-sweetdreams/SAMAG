Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, aiming to bridge the gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, where we leverage contextualized embeddings and attention mechanisms to generate more informative and diverse expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming traditional methods and state-of-the-art neural models. Our approach provides a new direction for exploring the intersection of natural language processing and information retrieval.
