Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph structures and the need to minimize communication overhead. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization, query rewriting, and distributed execution planning to improve query performance. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x, while reducing network communication by up to 50%.
