Task allocation is a critical problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using deep reinforcement learning. We design a novel neural network architecture that learns to allocate tasks based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and environmental constraints. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system adaptability.
