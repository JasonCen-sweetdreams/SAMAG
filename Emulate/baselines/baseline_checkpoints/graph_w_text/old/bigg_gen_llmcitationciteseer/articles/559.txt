Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. Our method, called 'QOptRL', learns to generate optimal query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query performance. Experimental results show that QOptRL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
