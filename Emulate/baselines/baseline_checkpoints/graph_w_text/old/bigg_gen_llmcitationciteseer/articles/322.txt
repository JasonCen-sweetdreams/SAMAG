As robots become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, understanding how humans perceive and interact with them is crucial. This paper explores the role of embodiment in shaping social perception in human-robot interaction. We conducted a user study with a humanoid robot and a non-humanoid robot, manipulating the level of embodiment through physical appearance and behavioral cues. Our results show that higher embodiment leads to increased anthropomorphism and social attribution, but also raises concerns about robot autonomy and accountability. We discuss the implications of these findings for designing more effective and acceptable human-robot interaction systems.
