Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a neural re-ranking approach, 'QRxn', which leverages a deep learning model to re-rank the initial retrieval results based on query-specific term importance. Our method integrates a novel query expansion component that adaptively selects expansion terms from a semantic graph, enabling more accurate retrieval. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that QRxn achieves a significant improvement in mean average precision over state-of-the-art baseline models.
