Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that leverages graph-structured data to generate personalized explanations for recommendation results. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global dependencies in the user-item graph, enabling the model to identify influential nodes and edges. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art explainable recommendation approaches in terms of both accuracy and explanation quality.
