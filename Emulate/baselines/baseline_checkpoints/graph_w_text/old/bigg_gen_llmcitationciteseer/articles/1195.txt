This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the role of gesture-based interaction in enhancing user experience and understanding. We design and implement a VR system that incorporates a gesture recognition module, allowing users to manipulate virtual objects using natural hand movements. Our user study involving 30 participants reveals that embodied cognition principles can significantly improve user engagement, spatial awareness, and cognitive load reduction in VR-based tasks. We discuss the implications of our findings on the design of future VR systems and their potential applications in areas such as education, training, and therapy.
