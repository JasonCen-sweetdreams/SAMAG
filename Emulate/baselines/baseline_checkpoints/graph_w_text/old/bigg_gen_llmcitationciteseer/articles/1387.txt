Query optimization is a crucial component of relational databases, particularly in distributed settings where data is spread across multiple nodes. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, which can be inefficient and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to learn optimal query plans. We design an RL framework that incorporates a reward function based on query execution time and a neural network-based policy to select the best query plan. Experimental results on a distributed relational database benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
