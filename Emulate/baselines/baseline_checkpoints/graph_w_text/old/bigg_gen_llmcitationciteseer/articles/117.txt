In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'RL-MASTA', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in real-time. RL-MASTA utilizes a decentralized, Q-learning-based approach that enables agents to learn from their interactions with the environment and adapt to changing task requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-MASTA outperforms traditional, centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and system efficiency, while maintaining robustness to agent failures and communication losses.
