In real-time systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for meeting timing constraints. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'DARTA', which dynamically allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities and the system's workload. DARTA employs a hierarchical decomposition of the task allocation problem, allowing agents to learn decentralized policies that adapt to changing system conditions. Experimental results on a synthetic real-time system demonstrate that DARTA outperforms traditional heuristic-based approaches in terms of task completion rates and system responsiveness.
