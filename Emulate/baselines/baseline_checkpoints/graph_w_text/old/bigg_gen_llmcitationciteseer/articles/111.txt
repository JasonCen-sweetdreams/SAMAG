Specialized search engines catering to specific domains, such as biomedical or legal searches, often struggle with limited query contexts and ambiguities. We propose a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE-SS', which leverages domain-specific knowledge graphs to disambiguate user queries and generate context-aware expansion terms. Our approach exploits the hierarchical structure of knowledge graphs to capture semantic relationships between entities, resulting in more accurate and relevant search results. Experimental evaluations on two real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and query reformulation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
