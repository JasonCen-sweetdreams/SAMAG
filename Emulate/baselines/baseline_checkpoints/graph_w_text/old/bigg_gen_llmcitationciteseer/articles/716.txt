Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, optimizing query execution in such systems remains a challenging problem, as it requires balancing factors like data locality, node heterogeneity, and concurrent query execution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design an RL agent that learns to select optimal query plans based on feedback from the database. Experimental results on a simulated distributed database show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
