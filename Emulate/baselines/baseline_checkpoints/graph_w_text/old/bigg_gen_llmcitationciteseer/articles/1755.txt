Document ranking is a crucial component of modern search engines, but existing methods often struggle to scale to large document collections. This paper presents Hierarchical Deep Retrieval (HDR), a novel approach that leverages a hierarchical representation of documents to efficiently retrieve and rank relevant documents. HDR incorporates a deep neural network to learn a dense vector representation of documents, which are then organized into a hierarchical index structure. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HDR achieves significant improvements in ranking accuracy and retrieval efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
