Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. One effective approach to improve retrieval performance is query expansion, which involves adding relevant terms to the original query. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network-based approach for query expansion, which learns to generate context-aware expansions that capture the semantic relationships between the query terms and the document collection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving improved mean average precision and recall.
