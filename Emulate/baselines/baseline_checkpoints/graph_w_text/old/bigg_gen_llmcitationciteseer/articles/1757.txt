Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their usability for older adults remains a concern. This paper investigates the role of conversational strategies in promoting inclusivity in voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65-85, exploring the effectiveness of three conversational strategies: explicit confirmation, implicit guidance, and error recovery. Our findings suggest that explicit confirmation and implicit guidance significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction, while error recovery strategies reduced frustration. We provide design recommendations for developing more inclusive voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults.
