Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, optimizing queries for distributed graph databases remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, subquery decomposition, and parallel execution to minimize query latency. We evaluate GraphOpt on a range of real-world graph datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
