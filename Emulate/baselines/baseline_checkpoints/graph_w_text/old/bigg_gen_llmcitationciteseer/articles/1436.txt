Node classification on graph-structured data remains a challenging task, particularly when interpretability is desired. We present HGAN, a hierarchical graph attention network that leverages both local and global graph patterns to classify nodes in a explainable manner. HGAN employs a novel hierarchical attention mechanism, which adaptively selects relevant neighbors and graph motifs to focus on during node representation learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN on several benchmark datasets, showing improved accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art graph neural networks.
