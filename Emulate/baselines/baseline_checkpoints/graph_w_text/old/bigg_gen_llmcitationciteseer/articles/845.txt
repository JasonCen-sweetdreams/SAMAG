Anomaly detection is a critical component of modern cybersecurity systems. However, traditional machine learning approaches often struggle to adapt to evolving threats in real-time. This paper presents a novel Self-Modifying Neural Network (SMNN) architecture that leverages meta-learning to learn from its own mistakes. By dynamically updating its weights and architecture, the SMNN can detect novel anomalies without human intervention. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale network intrusion dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy and response time compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
