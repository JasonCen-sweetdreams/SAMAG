Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in many households, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by accessibility and usability issues. This paper presents a participatory design study involving 20 older adults, exploring the design of inclusive voice assistants that cater to their needs. We identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement, including personalized speech recognition, multimodal interfaces, and simplified task management. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant prototype, 'EasyVoice', which is evaluated in a usability study with 15 older adults, demonstrating improved user experience and task completion rates.
