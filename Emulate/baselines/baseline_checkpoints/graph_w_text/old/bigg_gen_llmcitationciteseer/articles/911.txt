The surge in digital information has led to an exponential growth in the size of document collections, posing significant challenges to search engines. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) technique that leverages the semantic relationships between terms to improve the efficiency and accuracy of document retrieval. Our approach involves clustering related terms into hierarchical groups, which are then used to expand the original query. Experimental results on the TREC dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 25% increase in precision while reducing query processing time by 30%.
