Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale datasets. However, indexing high-dimensional data remains a significant challenge, particularly in distributed settings. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'HD-Tree', which leverages a hierarchical decomposition of the data space to efficiently index high-dimensional data. We demonstrate that HD-Tree outperforms existing indexing methods in terms of query performance and storage efficiency, while maintaining scalability in distributed environments. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that HD-Tree achieves up to 3x query speedup and 2x storage reduction compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
