The proliferation of large-scale RDF datasets has created a pressing need for efficient graph pattern matching algorithms. Existing solutions often rely on expensive subgraph isomorphism tests, which can lead to poor performance. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing scheme, called 'RDF-Index', that leverages the structural properties of RDF graphs to accelerate pattern matching. Our approach combines a compact graph representation with a hierarchical indexing framework, enabling fast filtering and verification of candidate matches. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that RDF-Index achieves up to 5x speedup over state-of-the-art algorithms while reducing memory usage by 30%.
