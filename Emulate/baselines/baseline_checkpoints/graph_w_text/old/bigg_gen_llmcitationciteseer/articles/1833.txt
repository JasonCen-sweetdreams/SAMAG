Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train an agent to select the optimal execution plan. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based optimization techniques, achieving an average query execution time reduction of 35%. We also demonstrate the scalability of our approach by evaluating its performance on increasingly large datasets.
