Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) requires efficient join processing to support rapid analytics and decision-making. This paper presents a novel join optimization technique, 'CSJoin', specifically designed for column-store databases. Our approach leverages data skipping, late materialization, and adaptive sorting to minimize I/O and CPU costs. We demonstrate the efficacy of CSJoin using a comprehensive evaluation on a large-scale RTDW benchmark, showcasing significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art join methods.
