This study explores the design of voice assistant interfaces tailored to the needs of elderly individuals in smart home environments. We conducted a mixed-methods study, involving surveys, interviews, and usability testing, to identify the key challenges and preferences of older adults when interacting with voice assistants. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise voice prompts, intuitive navigation, and personalized feedback. Based on these insights, we propose a novel interface design framework, 'ElderVoice', which incorporates a set of guidelines and design patterns to enhance the accessibility and usability of voice assistants for older adults. A pilot study with 20 elderly participants demonstrates the effectiveness of ElderVoice in improving task completion rates and user satisfaction.
