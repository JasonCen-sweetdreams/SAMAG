In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. Existing methods often rely on centralized planners or distributed algorithms that neglect inter-agent dependencies. This paper proposes a novel approach, GraphConv-TA, which leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies. By modeling agent interactions as a graph, our method captures complex dependencies and allocates tasks in a coordinated manner. Experimental results on a range of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rate and overall system efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
