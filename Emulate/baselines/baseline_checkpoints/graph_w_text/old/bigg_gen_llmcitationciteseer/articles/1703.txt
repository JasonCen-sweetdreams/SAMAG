Recommendation systems are crucial in today's online platforms, but they often struggle with large-scale datasets and cold start problems. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages the power of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to learn hierarchical representations of users and items. Our approach enables scalable and efficient recommendation generation by adaptively aggregating local and global features. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in terms of precision, recall, and coverage over state-of-the-art methods.
