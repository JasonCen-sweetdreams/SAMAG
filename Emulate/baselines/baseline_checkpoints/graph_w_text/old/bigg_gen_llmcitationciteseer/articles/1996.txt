Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering and heuristic-based approaches. This paper proposes a novel neural QE framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query reformulation. Our model, dubbed 'DeepQE', learns to generate effective query expansions by interacting with a simulated retrieval environment and receiving rewards based on retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving improvements of up to 15% in mean average precision.
