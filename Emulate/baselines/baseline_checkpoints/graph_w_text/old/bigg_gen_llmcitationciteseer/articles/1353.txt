Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features for emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention modules and a hierarchical fusion mechanism, enabling efficient and effective learning from multi-modal data. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a significant improvement in recognition accuracy and F1-score.
