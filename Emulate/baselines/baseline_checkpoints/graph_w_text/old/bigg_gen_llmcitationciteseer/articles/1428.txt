Few-shot image classification remains a challenging task in machine learning. This paper presents a novel deep metric learning approach, 'HierProto', which leverages hierarchical prototypes to improve the classification accuracy of unseen classes. By learning a nested structure of prototypes, our model can effectively capture the semantic relationships between classes and adapt to new classes with limited training data. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierProto outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image classification, achieving impressive gains in accuracy and robustness.
