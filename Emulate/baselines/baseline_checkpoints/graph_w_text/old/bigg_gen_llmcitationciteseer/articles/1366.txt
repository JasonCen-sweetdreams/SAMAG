Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for timely business intelligence and decision-making. However, traditional row-oriented storage schemes struggle to meet the performance demands of modern analytics workloads. This paper presents 'ColumnRush', a novel columnar storage architecture optimized for real-time query processing in data warehousing environments. By leveraging a hybrid storage layout and adaptive data encoding, ColumnRush achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art column stores, reducing query latency by up to 70% in our experiments with a large-scale retail dataset.
