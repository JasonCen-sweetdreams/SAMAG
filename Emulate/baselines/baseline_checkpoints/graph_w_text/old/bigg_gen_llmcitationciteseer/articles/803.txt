Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a key challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and behavior in VR environments. We designed and implemented an avatar customization system that integrates machine learning-based facial recognition and 3D modeling techniques. A user study with 120 participants reveals that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, self-presence, and overall satisfaction in VR applications. Our results have implications for the design of future VR systems that aim to enhance user experience and interaction.
