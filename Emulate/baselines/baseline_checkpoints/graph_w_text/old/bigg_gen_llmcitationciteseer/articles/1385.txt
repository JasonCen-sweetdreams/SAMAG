Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or short queries. This paper introduces a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepCx', which leverages deep contextualized embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and document contents. We propose a hierarchical attention mechanism that aggregates contextualized embeddings from multiple layers to generate a more comprehensive query representation. Experimental results on several TREC benchmarks demonstrate that DeepCx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
