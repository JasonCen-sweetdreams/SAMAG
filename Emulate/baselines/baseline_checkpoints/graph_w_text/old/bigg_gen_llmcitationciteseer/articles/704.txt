Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it directly affects the retrieval effectiveness. This paper presents a novel QE approach, 'RL-Expander', which leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to select the most informative expansion terms. RL-Expander models the QE process as a Markov decision process and uses a DRL agent to learn an optimal policy for term selection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-Expander outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
