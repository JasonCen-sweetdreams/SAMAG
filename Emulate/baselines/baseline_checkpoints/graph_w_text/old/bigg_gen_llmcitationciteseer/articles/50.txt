Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on term co-occurrence statistics, which can be limited by sparse data. This paper proposes a neural approach to query expansion, leveraging document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our model, NQE, learns to project queries and documents into a shared vector space, allowing for effective expansion of queries using nearest neighbors. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing the need for manual parameter tuning.
