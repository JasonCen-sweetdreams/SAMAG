Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to adapt query plans based on the underlying database system's workload and performance metrics. Experimental results on a real-world database workload demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
