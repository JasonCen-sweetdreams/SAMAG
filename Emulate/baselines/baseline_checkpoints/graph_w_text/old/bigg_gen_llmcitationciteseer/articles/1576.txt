Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that combines local and global attention mechanisms to detect anomalies in multivariate time-series data. Our approach provides explainable results by highlighting the most relevant features and time segments contributing to the anomaly. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HAN over state-of-the-art methods, while our visualization technique enables effective anomaly explanation.
