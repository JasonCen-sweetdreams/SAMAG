Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are increasingly used to index and search large-scale datasets. However, query processing in DIR systems can be inefficient due to the need to communicate with multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel approach to improve query efficiency in DIR systems using hierarchical clustering. We present a clustering algorithm that groups nodes based on their index statistics, reducing the number of nodes required to process a query. Our experiments on a large-scale dataset show that our approach reduces query latency by up to 40% compared to traditional DIR systems while maintaining retrieval effectiveness.
