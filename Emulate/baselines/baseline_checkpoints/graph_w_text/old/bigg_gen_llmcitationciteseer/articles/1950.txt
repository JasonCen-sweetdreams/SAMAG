Multi-agent systems (MAS) have seen widespread adoption in various domains, but their decision-making processes remain opaque. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision making in MAS. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to identify relevant interactions between agents and their environment, while a hierarchical structure allows for the abstraction of high-level goals from low-level actions. We evaluate our approach on a series of benchmark scenarios, demonstrating improved explainability and decision quality compared to state-of-the-art MAS methods.
