Virtual reality (VR) technology has made significant strides in recent years, but the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of haptic feedback on user experience in VR. We conducted a series of user studies using a custom-built VR system with varying levels of haptic feedback. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user satisfaction, presence, and performance in VR tasks. We also identify key factors influencing the effectiveness of haptic feedback, including feedback type, intensity, and synchronization. The findings have important implications for the design of VR systems and interfaces that incorporate haptic feedback.
