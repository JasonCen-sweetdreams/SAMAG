In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents while satisfying constraints and optimizing performance metrics. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We propose a hybrid algorithm that combines DCOP with a decentralized task allocation protocol, enabling agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that our approach outperforms centralized optimization methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
