Time-series forecasting plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, but the lack of interpretability in traditional deep learning models hinders trust and understanding. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that combines local and global attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant time-series segments and features. Our approach provides explainable predictions by visualizing attention weights and importance scores. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and uncertainty estimation, while offering enhanced interpretability.
