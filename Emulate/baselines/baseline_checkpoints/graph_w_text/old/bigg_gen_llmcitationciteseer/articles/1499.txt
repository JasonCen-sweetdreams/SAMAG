This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for autonomous agents, inspired by evolutionary game theory. We propose a decentralized strategy that allows agents to adaptively allocate tasks based on their individual capabilities and environmental conditions. Our algorithm, 'EGA-TA', incorporates a genetic programming framework to evolve effective task allocation policies, which are then refined through iterative game-theoretic analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that EGA-TA outperforms existing centralized and distributed task allocation methods in terms of task completion time, agent utility, and system robustness.
