Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize user interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, where we manipulated avatar personalization levels and measured user engagement metrics, such as time spent in the VR environment, navigation efficiency, and self-reported enjoyment. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, particularly for users with high self-identity scores. We discuss implications for VR system design and provide recommendations for integrating personalized avatars in VR applications.
