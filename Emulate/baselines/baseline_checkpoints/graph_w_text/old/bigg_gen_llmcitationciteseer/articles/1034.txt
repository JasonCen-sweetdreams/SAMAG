Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to join ordering, which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to reduce the number of joins and minimize data transfer. We present a new cost model that captures the complexity of join operations and develop a heuristic search algorithm to efficiently explore the vast space of possible join orders. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
