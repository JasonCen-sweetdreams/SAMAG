Microblog retrieval poses unique challenges due to the short length and noisy nature of tweets. Query expansion (QE) techniques can improve retrieval effectiveness, but traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to new datasets. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'Deep QE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. We evaluate Deep QE on two large-scale microblog datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art QE methods, with an average gain of 15% in mean average precision.
