Multi-tenant edge computing environments face the challenge of allocating resources efficiently among competing tenants. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'AdaptiveEdge', which learns to optimize resource allocation in real-time. AdaptiveEdge employs a hierarchical policy architecture that integrates tenant behavior modeling, resource forecasting, and adaptive exploration-exploitation strategies. Experimental results on a simulated edge computing environment demonstrate significant improvements in tenant satisfaction, resource utilization, and overall system efficiency compared to traditional heuristic-based allocation methods.
