Hybrid relational-NoSQL databases have gained popularity for their ability to handle diverse data models and scale horizontally. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'HybridOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages the strengths of both relational and NoSQL query engines. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that exploits data distribution statistics and leverages machine learning models to predict query execution times. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HybridOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in hybrid databases, achieving up to 3x performance improvement.
