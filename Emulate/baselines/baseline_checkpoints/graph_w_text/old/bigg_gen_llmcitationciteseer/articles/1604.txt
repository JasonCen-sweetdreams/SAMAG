Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) that aims to improve the retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. However, traditional query expansion methods suffer from high computational costs and limited semantic understanding. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages deep learning models to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our method uses a combination of word embeddings and graph neural networks to learn a hierarchical representation of the query and documents, enabling more effective query expansion and retrieval. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.
