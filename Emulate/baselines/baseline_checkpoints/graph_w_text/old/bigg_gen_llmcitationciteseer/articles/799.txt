Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education and training, but high cognitive load can hinder user engagement and learning outcomes. This paper presents an embodied cognition-based framework for designing VR interventions that mitigate cognitive load. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a combination of cognitive load metrics, EEG, and behavioral data to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed interventions. Results show significant reductions in cognitive load and improved task performance when embodied cognition principles are integrated into VR experiences.
