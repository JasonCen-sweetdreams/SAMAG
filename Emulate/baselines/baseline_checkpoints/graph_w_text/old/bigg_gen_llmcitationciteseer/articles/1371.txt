E-commerce search engines are vulnerable to adversarial queries designed to manipulate retrieval results. This paper proposes a novel deep query expansion approach, 'DQE-Adv', to enhance the robustness of search engines against such attacks. DQE-Adv employs a neural network-based query expansion model that learns to identify and mitigate the impact of adversarial keywords. Our experiments on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that DQE-Adv outperforms existing query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval accuracy and robustness against adversarial queries.
