Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various fields, but the lack of interpretability in modern deep learning models hinders their adoption. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant temporal patterns. We demonstrate that HAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while providing explicit feature importance scores, enabling explainability and transparency in forecasting tasks. Experimental results show that HAN outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and feature attribution.
