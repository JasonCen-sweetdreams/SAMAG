Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention neural network (HATN) that not only detects anomalies accurately but also provides explainable insights. HATN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant time segments and features, enabling the identification of anomaly patterns. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating HATN's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both detection performance and interpretability.
