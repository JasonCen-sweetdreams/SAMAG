In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'RL-ALLOC', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in real-time. Each agent learns to adapt its allocation strategy based on local observations and received rewards, without relying on centralized coordination. We evaluate RL-ALLOC in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion times and overall system efficiency compared to traditional, hand-designed allocation methods.
