Conversational agents have become ubiquitous in various aspects of modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents a human-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational agents that cater to diverse abilities. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with disabilities, revealing key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed framework, 'IncluChat', integrates accessibility features such as multimodal interaction, customized feedback, and emotional support. A usability study demonstrated significant improvements in user experience and satisfaction with IncluChat compared to existing chatbots. Our work contributes to a more inclusive and empathetic HCI for conversational agents.
