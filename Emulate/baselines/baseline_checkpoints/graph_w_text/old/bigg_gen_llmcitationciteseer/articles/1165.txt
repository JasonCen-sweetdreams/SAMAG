Collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems often suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large user-item graphs. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that leverages both local and global graph structures to model user-item interactions. Our approach hierarchically clusters users and items into communities, allowing for efficient computation of attention weights and reducing the complexity of graph-based recommendations. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and computational efficiency.
