Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data analysis, but existing methods often struggle with scalability and capturing complex relationships. We introduce HGAT, a hierarchical graph attention network that leverages a novel multi-scale attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant neighbors and contextual information. HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including protein-protein interaction networks and social networks, and demonstrates improved robustness to graph perturbations.
