Ad-hoc retrieval poses significant challenges in capturing the user's information need, particularly when the query is short or ambiguous. We propose a novel query expansion approach, 'RL-Expander', that leverages reinforcement learning to select the most informative expansion terms. By framing query expansion as a Markov decision process, we can optimize the expansion strategy to maximize the retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that RL-Expander outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
