Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to bridge the vocabulary gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepRL-QE', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to adaptively select expansion terms. Our method uses a hierarchical reward structure that balances precision and recall, and incorporates domain-specific knowledge graphs to guide the expansion process. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that DeepRL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and NDCG@10.
