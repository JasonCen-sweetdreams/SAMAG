Traditional document ranking models rely on either lexical matching or semantic understanding, but often suffer from inefficiency or limited contextual awareness. We propose a hybrid retrieval model, HARMONY, which integrates lexical, semantic, and hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture complex document relationships. Our model utilizes a novel document graph construction method to encode both local and global contextual information, enabling more accurate and efficient document ranking. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that HARMONY outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency.
