Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used to manage large-scale datasets, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans in DDS. We design an RL agent that learns to navigate the vast space of possible query plans and identify the most efficient ones. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
