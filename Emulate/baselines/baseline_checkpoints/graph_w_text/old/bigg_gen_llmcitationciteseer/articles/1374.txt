Time-series forecasting is a ubiquitous task in various domains, where incorporating multi-resolution inputs can significantly improve prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture, which leverages both short- and long-term dependencies in multi-resolution time-series data. The HAN model consists of a hierarchical encoder that extracts features at different resolutions, followed by an attention module that adaptively weights the importance of each resolution. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in scenarios with high-frequency sampling rates and limited training data.
