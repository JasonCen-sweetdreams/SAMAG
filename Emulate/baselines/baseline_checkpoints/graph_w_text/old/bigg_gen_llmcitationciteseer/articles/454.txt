Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including fault detection and predictive maintenance. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant segments and features of the time-series data, enabling the identification of anomalous patterns. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while providing insights into the contributing factors.
