Neural vector retrieval has shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but its computational cost remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel document ranking approach, 'NeuRank', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to reduce the number of required vector comparisons. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuRank achieves state-of-the-art ranking performance while reducing inference time by up to 40% compared to existing neural retrieval methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the trade-off between ranking accuracy and computational efficiency.
