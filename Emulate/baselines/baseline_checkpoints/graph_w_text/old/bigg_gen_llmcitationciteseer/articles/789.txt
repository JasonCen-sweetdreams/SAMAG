Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. While existing methods often rely on complex models, they lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our HAN architecture incorporates multi-scale feature extraction, attention-based feature aggregation, and a novel explainability module that highlights the most relevant input segments contributing to the anomaly detection. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies while providing insightful explanations.
