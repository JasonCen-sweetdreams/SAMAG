Distributed databases are increasingly used to store large volumes of multi-dimensional data. Efficient indexing techniques are crucial for supporting fast range query processing. This paper proposes a novel indexing scheme, called 'MultiRange', which leverages a combination of space-filling curves and compact bit-vector representations to enable fast and scalable range query processing. We evaluate MultiRange on a distributed database system and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing indexing techniques. The results show that MultiRange can reduce query latency by up to 70% while maintaining a low storage overhead.
