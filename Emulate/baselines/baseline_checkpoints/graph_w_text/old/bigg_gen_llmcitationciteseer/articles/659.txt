Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. Query expansion techniques can improve retrieval effectiveness, but often rely on manual feature engineering or simplistic weighting schemes. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between query terms and document content. Our approach integrates a neural query embedding module with a relevance-based ranking model, enabling effective expansion of query terms and improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DeepQE over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
