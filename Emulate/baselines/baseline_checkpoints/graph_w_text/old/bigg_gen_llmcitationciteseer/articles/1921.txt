In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and fair assignment of tasks to agents. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that incorporates incentive mechanisms to encourage agents to participate and contribute to the system. We design a blockchain-based protocol that enables agents to negotiate and agree upon task assignments, while ensuring fairness and transparency through smart contracts. Experimental results on a simulated swarm robotics platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving system efficiency and agent satisfaction.
