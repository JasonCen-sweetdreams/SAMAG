Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale graph data, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages statistical graph summarization and parallel processing to minimize query latency. We propose a cost-based optimization approach that takes into account the graph structure, query patterns, and available computing resources. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time and reduces resource utilization by 40%.
