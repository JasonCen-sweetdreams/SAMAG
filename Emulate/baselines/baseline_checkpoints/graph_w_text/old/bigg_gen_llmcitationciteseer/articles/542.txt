Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by user experience issues. This paper explores the role of personalization in enhancing user experience in VR. We present a novel framework that leverages machine learning to adapt the VR environment to individual users' preferences, abilities, and behaviors. Our user study with 30 participants reveals that personalized VR experiences lead to improved user engagement, reduced cybersickness, and increased overall satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems and highlight avenues for further research.
