Few-shot node classification on graph-structured data remains a challenging task, especially when dealing with limited labeled samples. This paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), which leverages hierarchical graph representations to improve node classification performance. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to adaptively select relevant nodes and subgraphs, allowing the model to focus on the most informative regions of the graph. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, achieving an average relative improvement of 12.5% in accuracy.
