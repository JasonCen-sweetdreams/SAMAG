In multi-agent systems, decision-making is often complex and involves interactions between various agents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture to facilitate explainable decision-making in such systems. Our HAN model consists of two stages: intra-agent attention and inter-agent attention. The former captures the importance of different features within an agent, while the latter models the relationships between agents. We evaluate our approach on a real-world autonomous vehicle dataset and demonstrate improved decision-making performance and interpretability compared to existing multi-agent decision-making models.
