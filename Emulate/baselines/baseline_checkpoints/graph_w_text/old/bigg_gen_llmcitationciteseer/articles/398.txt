Distributed database systems are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel dynamic replication strategy, DRIFT, that adaptively adjusts data replication based on query patterns and system workloads. DRIFT leverages a hybrid approach combining reinforcement learning and graph-based optimization to minimize query latency and maximize data freshness. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate that DRIFT outperforms existing replication strategies, achieving up to 30% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in data consistency violations.
