Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it can significantly impact the retrieval performance. Traditional query expansion methods rely on manual feature engineering and often struggle to capture complex semantic relationships. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, dubbed 'DeepQE', which learns to expand queries by modeling the semantic interactions between query terms and documents. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval precision and recall, while reducing the computational overhead. We also provide insights into the learned representations and their implications for IR systems.
