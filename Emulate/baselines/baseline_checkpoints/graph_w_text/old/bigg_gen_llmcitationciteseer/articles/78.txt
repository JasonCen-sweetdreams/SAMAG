Cooperative task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must allocate tasks to optimize system-wide performance. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn cooperative task allocation policies. We introduce a hierarchical GNN architecture that models agent interactions and task dependencies, and show that it outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in complex task allocation scenarios. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various domains, including robotics, logistics, and disaster response.
