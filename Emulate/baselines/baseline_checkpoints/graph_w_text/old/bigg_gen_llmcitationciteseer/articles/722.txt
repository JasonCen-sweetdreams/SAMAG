Virtual reality (VR) systems often struggle to provide effective error feedback, leading to user frustration and decreased performance. This paper presents a novel multimodal error feedback framework that combines visual, auditory, and haptic cues to facilitate error detection and correction. Our user study demonstrates that this framework significantly improves user experience and task completion time compared to traditional unimodal feedback approaches. We also discuss the implications of our findings for designing more intuitive and user-centered VR interfaces.
