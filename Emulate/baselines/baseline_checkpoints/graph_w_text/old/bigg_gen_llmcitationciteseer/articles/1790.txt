In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach, called Decentralized Task Allocation with Graph Neural Networks (DTA-GNN), leverages the graph structure of the agent communication network to learn effective task assignment strategies. DTA-GNN consists of two main components: a GNN-based task encoder and a decentralized task allocation algorithm. The task encoder learns to represent tasks as node embeddings, which are then used by the allocation algorithm to assign tasks to agents based on their capabilities and availability. We evaluate DTA-GNN on a variety of multi-agent task allocation scenarios and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art decentralized allocation methods.
