Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on heuristics or manual feature engineering. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion policies. Our framework, 'RL-QE', learns to select the most informative terms to add to the original query by interacting with a simulated retrieval environment. We evaluate RL-QE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision over state-of-the-art baseline methods. Our analysis shows that RL-QE is particularly effective in scenarios with limited training data and noisy query representations.
