This paper presents a novel approach to search result diversification, which aims to provide users with a diverse set of relevant documents in response to a query. We propose a query-adaptive document filtering framework that leverages a combination of relevance and novelty metrics to select a diverse subset of documents from the initial retrieval set. Our approach incorporates a neural ranking model that is trained to optimize a diversity-aware objective function. Experimental results on a large-scale web dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art diversification methods in terms of both relevance and diversity metrics.
