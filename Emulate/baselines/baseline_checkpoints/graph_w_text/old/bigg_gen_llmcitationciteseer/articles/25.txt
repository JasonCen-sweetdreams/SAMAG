Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing interfaces often exacerbate cognitive load and frustration. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design recommendations, and developed a novel VR system that incorporates cognitive support features, such as personalized guidance and error forgiveness. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces.
