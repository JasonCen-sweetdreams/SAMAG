Voice assistants have the potential to improve the daily lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but current designs often fail to accommodate their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing inclusive voice assistants, incorporating insights from cognitive psychology and gerontechnology. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying key design requirements for improved comprehension, memory support, and error tolerance. Our prototype, 'CognitiveCare', demonstrates the feasibility of integrating these requirements into a functional voice assistant, with promising results in pilot testing with our target user group.
