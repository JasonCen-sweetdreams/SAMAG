This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and limitations need to collaborate to achieve complex tasks. Our approach leverages dynamic coalition formation, enabling agents to adaptively form and reform teams in response to changing task requirements and agent availability. We introduce a distributed algorithm that integrates task decomposition, coalition formation, and resource allocation, and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations in a disaster response scenario.
