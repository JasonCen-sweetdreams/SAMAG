Virtual Reality (VR) has shown promise in social skills training for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study investigates the impact of embodied avatars on the effectiveness of VR-based social skills training. We designed a within-subjects experiment where 20 participants with ASD interacted with either an embodied avatar or a non-embodied agent in a VR environment. Results indicate that participants who interacted with the embodied avatar demonstrated significant improvements in social skills, including eye contact and gestural behavior, compared to those who interacted with the non-embodied agent. Our findings suggest that embodied avatars can enhance the efficacy of VR-based social skills training for individuals with ASD.
