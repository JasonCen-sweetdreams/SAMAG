Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) is a crucial AI application with significant implications for human-computer interaction. However, current MER systems often rely on computationally expensive attention mechanisms, limiting their feasibility for real-time deployment. This paper proposes a novel, efficient attention framework, 'EmoFocus', which leverages sparse attention weights and adaptive feature fusion to reduce computational overhead. Our experiments on the benchmarked CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that EmoFocus achieves state-of-the-art MER performance while reducing inference time by up to 50% compared to existing attention-based approaches.
