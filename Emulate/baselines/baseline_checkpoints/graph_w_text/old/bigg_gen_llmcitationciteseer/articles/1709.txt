This paper presents a novel decentralized multi-agent system for real-time traffic signal control. Our approach leverages adaptive coordination mechanisms to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion in dynamic urban environments. We introduce a probabilistic graphical model to represent the interactions between traffic agents and signals, and develop a distributed optimization algorithm to update signal timings in response to changing traffic conditions. Experimental results using real-world traffic data demonstrate significant improvements in travel time, queue lengths, and intersection safety compared to traditional fixed-timing signal control methods.
