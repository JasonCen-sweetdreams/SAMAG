Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide transparent decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attentional graph neural network (HAGNN) architecture that leverages graph-based user-item interactions to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. Our approach employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant neighborhood nodes, allowing the model to capture complex relationships between users and items. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models in terms of both accuracy and interpretability.
