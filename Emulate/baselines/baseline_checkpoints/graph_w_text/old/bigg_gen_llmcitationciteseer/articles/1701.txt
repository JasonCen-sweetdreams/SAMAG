Distributed databases are increasingly used to store and manage large-scale datasets. Efficient indexing mechanisms are crucial for supporting complex queries, such as multi-dimensional range queries. This paper presents a novel indexing scheme, called 'Distributed Grid Index' (DGI), which leverages a hierarchical grid-based structure to efficiently prune search spaces. DGI is optimized for distributed settings, exploiting data locality and parallel processing to minimize communication overhead. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DGI outperforms existing indexing methods in terms of query latency and throughput.
