This paper presents a novel approach to document representation, Hierarchical Document Embeddings (HDE), which enables efficient semantic search in large document collections. HDE leverages a hierarchical recurrent neural network to capture both local and global semantic context, resulting in compact and informative document embeddings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval precision and query efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world information retrieval applications.
