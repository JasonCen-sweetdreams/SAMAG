Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial in various domains, including finance and healthcare. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time series anomaly detection. HAN leverages multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms to identify anomalous patterns at different temporal resolutions. We evaluate HAN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, we provide visualizations and feature importance scores to facilitate understanding of the anomaly detection process.
