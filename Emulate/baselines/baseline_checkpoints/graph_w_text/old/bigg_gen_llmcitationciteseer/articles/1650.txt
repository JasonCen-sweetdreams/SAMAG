This paper presents a novel deep learning framework, 'MTSF-Net', for multi-modal time series forecasting. MTSF-Net leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively integrate information from diverse data sources, such as weather, traffic, and sensor readings. We propose a novel interpretability technique, 'TSF-Attribution', to explain the model's predictions in terms of feature importance. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that MTSF-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and scalability, while providing insights into the underlying patterns and relationships.
