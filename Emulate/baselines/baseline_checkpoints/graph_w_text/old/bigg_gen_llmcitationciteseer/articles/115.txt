As database systems scale to meet the demands of modern applications, query optimization becomes increasingly complex. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database system. Our approach, called 'RL-QOpt', adapts to changing database workloads and outperforms traditional query optimizers in terms of execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-QOpt in improving query performance and reducing resource consumption.
