State-of-the-art neural ranking models for document retrieval often suffer from high computational costs and limited interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hybrid attention-based neural ranking model, 'HANR', which leverages both local and global contextual features to improve retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. HANR incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively weights document sections and terms, enabling more accurate ranking and reduced computational overhead. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HANR outperforms existing neural ranking models in terms of both retrieval accuracy and inference speed.
