Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessible interfaces for users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel VR interface framework, 'AccessibleVR', which incorporates a range of inclusive design principles to facilitate seamless interaction for users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of AccessibleVR, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to existing VR interfaces.
