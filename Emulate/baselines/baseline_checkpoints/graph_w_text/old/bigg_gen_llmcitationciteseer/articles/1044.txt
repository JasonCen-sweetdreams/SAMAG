Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-structured data, where only a limited number of labeled nodes are available for training. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs. HGAT consists of a hierarchical node encoder, which captures node features at multiple scales, and a graph attention module, which adaptively weights the importance of neighboring nodes. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, particularly when dealing with class-imbalanced and noisy data.
