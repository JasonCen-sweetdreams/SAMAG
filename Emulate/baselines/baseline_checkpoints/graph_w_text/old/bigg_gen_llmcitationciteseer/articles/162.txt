Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the relevance of retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep learning-based sentence embeddings. We leverage a pre-trained language model to generate sentence embeddings for the query and candidate expansion terms, and then use a neural network to predict the relevance of each term. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in retrieval effectiveness.
