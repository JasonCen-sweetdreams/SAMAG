The increasing complexity of IoT systems demands efficient resource allocation strategies to ensure real-time performance. This paper proposes an intelligent agent-based framework, 'iARA', which leverages multi-agent systems to allocate resources dynamically based on IoT device demands. iARA incorporates a novel negotiation protocol that enables agents to adapt to changing system conditions, minimizing resource waste and maximizing system throughput. Experimental results on a simulated industrial IoT scenario demonstrate that iARA outperforms traditional centralized allocation approaches, achieving up to 35% reduction in response time and 20% improvement in resource utilization.
