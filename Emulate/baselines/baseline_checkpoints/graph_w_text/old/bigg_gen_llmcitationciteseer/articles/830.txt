Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current VR interfaces often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents 'EchoVR', a novel, audio-based VR interface designed to facilitate navigation and interaction for visually impaired users. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, evaluating EchoVR's effectiveness in enhancing spatial awareness, task completion, and user experience. Results show significant improvements in all three aspects, highlighting the potential of inclusive VR design to promote digital equality.
