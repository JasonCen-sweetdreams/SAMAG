This paper proposes a novel holonic multi-agent system (HMAS) for dynamic resource allocation in smart grids. We model the grid as a hierarchical organization of holons, each representing a distributed energy resource or a control device. Our HMAS framework enables autonomous decision-making and real-time adaptation to changing grid conditions, such as renewable energy fluctuations or unexpected load surges. We evaluate the performance of our approach using a case study on a realistic smart grid testbed, demonstrating improved resource utilization, reduced energy losses, and enhanced grid resilience.
