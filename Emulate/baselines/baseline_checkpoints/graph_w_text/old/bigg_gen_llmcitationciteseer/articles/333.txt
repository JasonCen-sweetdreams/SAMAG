Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised concerns. This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the robustness of GNNs against graph perturbations. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively selects and weights relevant graph neighborhoods, reducing the impact of perturbations on node representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the robustness of GNNs against various types of attacks, while maintaining their accuracy on clean graphs.
