Time-series forecasting models often struggle to provide insights into their decision-making processes, hindering their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that addresses this issue by learning to focus on relevant time segments and features. Our approach combines a multi-scale attention mechanism with a probabilistic forecasting framework, enabling the model to generate uncertainty estimates and feature importance scores. Experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed HAN model's improved forecasting accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
