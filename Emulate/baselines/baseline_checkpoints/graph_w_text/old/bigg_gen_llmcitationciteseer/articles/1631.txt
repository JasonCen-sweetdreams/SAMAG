Modern recommendation systems face scalability challenges in handling large user-item graphs. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages a hierarchical representation of the graph, allowing for efficient processing of large-scale datasets. HGAT uses a self-attention mechanism to model complex relationships between users and items, and a hierarchical clustering approach to reduce the computational cost of attention computation. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based recommendation models in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
