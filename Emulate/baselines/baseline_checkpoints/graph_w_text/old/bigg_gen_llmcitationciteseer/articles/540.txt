Multi-dimensional datasets are increasingly common in various domains, including scientific simulations, IoT, and social networks. Querying such datasets efficiently is a significant challenge due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, called 'GraDI', which leverages the structural properties of the data to optimize query performance. GraDI represents the dataset as a graph, where each node corresponds to a data point, and edges capture the similarity between points. We develop a query optimization framework that utilizes graph traversal algorithms to prune the search space and reduce the number of disk accesses. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that GraDI outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3.5x in terms of query response time.
