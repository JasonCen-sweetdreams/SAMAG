Augmented reality (AR) technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with our environment, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents an inclusive AR interface design framework that leverages audio and haptic feedback to facilitate navigation and object manipulation for visually impaired users. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that our proposed framework improved task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-based AR interfaces. Our work contributes to a more accessible and inclusive AR ecosystem.
