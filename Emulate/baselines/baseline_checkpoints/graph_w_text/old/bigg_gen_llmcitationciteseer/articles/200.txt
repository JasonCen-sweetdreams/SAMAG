Explainable recommendation systems have gained popularity in recent years, but most existing methods rely on simplistic graph structures or overlook item relationships. This paper proposes a novel heterogeneous graph attention network (HGAT) that integrates multi-type items and user behaviors into a unified graph. Our HGAT model leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on influential nodes and edges, generating personalized explanations for recommended items. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models in terms of both accuracy and interpretability.
