Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, but manual tuning can be time-consuming and error-prone. This paper presents a novel auto-tuning framework, 'QOpt', which leverages machine learning to optimize query plans in distributed environments. QOpt uses a combination of query features, system metrics, and workload patterns to predict optimal join orders, indexing strategies, and data placement. We evaluate QOpt on a range of benchmarks and show significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional rule-based optimizers.
