Autonomous vehicle platooning has the potential to significantly improve road safety and efficiency. However, coordinating the actions of multiple agents in a decentralized manner remains a major challenge. This paper proposes a novel framework for decentralized agent coordination, 'DAC-Platoon', which leverages a combination of distributed constraint optimization and multi-agent reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DAC-Platoon in simulated platooning scenarios, showcasing improved stability and responsiveness compared to centralized coordination approaches. Our results highlight the potential for decentralized agent coordination to enable scalable and fault-tolerant autonomous vehicle platooning.
