This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized, model-free algorithm that enables agents to learn optimal task assignments based on their capabilities, availability, and rewards. Our algorithm, 'HTA-RL', incorporates a graph-based representation of agent interactions and a novel reward function that promotes efficient task allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that HTA-RL outperforms traditional, manually-designed allocation strategies in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system robustness.
