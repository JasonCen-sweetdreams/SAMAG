Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial task in understanding public opinions on social media. This paper proposes a novel Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) approach to improve ABSA performance. Our method leverages the semantic relationships between aspects and sentiment words to better capture the context-dependent sentiment polarities. We introduce a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify latent aspects and their corresponding sentiment distributions. Experimental results on a large-scale Twitter dataset demonstrate that our LSA-based ABSA approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of aspect-wise sentiment accuracy and aspect detection F1-score.
