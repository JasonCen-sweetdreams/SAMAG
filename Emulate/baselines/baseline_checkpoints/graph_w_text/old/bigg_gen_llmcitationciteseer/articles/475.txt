Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, which involves resolving ambiguity in entity references. Existing approaches suffer from scalability issues, particularly when dealing with large knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GCEd', which leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn entity representations that capture contextual relationships. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, including DBpedia and YAGO, while reducing computation time by an order of magnitude. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the learned entity representations, revealing insights into the role of GCNs in disambiguation.
