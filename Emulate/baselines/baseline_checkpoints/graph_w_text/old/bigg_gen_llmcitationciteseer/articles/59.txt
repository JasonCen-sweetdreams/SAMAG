Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in data integration and knowledge graph construction. However, existing approaches suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large datasets. This paper proposes a novel approach, GraphHash, which leverages graph-based embeddings and hashing techniques to efficiently disambiguate entities. Our method first learns dense vector representations of entities using graph neural networks and then applies a locality-sensitive hashing scheme to efficiently identify similar entities. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphHash achieves state-of-the-art performance while being orders of magnitude faster than existing methods.
