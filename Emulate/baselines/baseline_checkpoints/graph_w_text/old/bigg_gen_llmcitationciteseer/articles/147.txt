This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We propose a distributed algorithm that leverages the agents' local observations and communication graphs to learn an optimal task assignment. Our approach utilizes GNNs to capture the structural properties of the agent network and adapt to dynamic changes in the environment. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency and agent utility.
