Ad-hoc information retrieval systems rely on effective query expansion techniques to improve retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic query representations. We employ a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion and relevance ranking, outperforming traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted features or shallow learning models. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE achieves significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain, especially for queries with limited relevant documents.
