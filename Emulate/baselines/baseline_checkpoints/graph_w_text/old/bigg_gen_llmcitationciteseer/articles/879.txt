Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often overlook the unique needs and challenges of this population. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyVR', a novel VR interface tailored to support older adults with cognitive impairments. Our approach incorporates simplicity, consistency, and cognitive support features, such as visual cues and audio prompts. A user study with 20 participants aged 65-85 demonstrates that EasyVR significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to a standard VR interface.
