Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'Graphion', a novel query optimization framework that leverages graph summarization and machine learning-based cost estimation to improve query efficiency. We propose a scalable, distributed indexing scheme and a dynamic query rewriting algorithm that adapts to changing data distributions. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that Graphion outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x, while reducing query latency by an average of 40%.
