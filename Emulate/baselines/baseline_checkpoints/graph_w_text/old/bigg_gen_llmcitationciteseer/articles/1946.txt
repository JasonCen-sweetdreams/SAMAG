This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks to learn agent-task affinity. Our approach, called GTA-Net, represents the agent-task interaction as a graph and employs a message-passing mechanism to distribute task assignments. GTA-Net outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and agent utilization, especially in scenarios with high task variability and limited communication bandwidth. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA-Net in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario featuring a team of autonomous robots.
