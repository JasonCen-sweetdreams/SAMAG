Ad-hoc retrieval systems often rely on simplistic document representations, neglecting the nuances of entity semantics. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'EDR', which integrates entity disambiguation into the document indexing process. By leveraging knowledge graph embeddings and contextualized language models, EDR enriches document representations with disambiguated entity information. Experiments on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries containing ambiguous entities. Our approach has implications for improving the accuracy and interpretability of search results in modern information retrieval systems.
