In multi-agent systems, cooperation is crucial for achieving complex tasks. However, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable multi-agent cooperation. HAN integrates attention mechanisms at both the agent and group levels, allowing agents to selectively focus on relevant teammates and tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a series of simulated robotic soccer experiments, showing improved cooperation and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
