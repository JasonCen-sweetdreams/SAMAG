Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and parallel query execution to minimize query latency. We introduce a graph-aware cost model that accurately predicts query execution times and a dynamic query reordering strategy that optimizes resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
