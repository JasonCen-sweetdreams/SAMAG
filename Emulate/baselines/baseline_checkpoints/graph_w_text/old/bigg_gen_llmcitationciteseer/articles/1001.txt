Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep learning-based semantic embeddings. Our method leverages a pre-trained language model to generate semantic embeddings for query terms and their expansion candidates. We then use a neural network to learn the semantic relationships between the embeddings and predict the relevance of expansion candidates. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, particularly for ambiguous and incomplete queries.
