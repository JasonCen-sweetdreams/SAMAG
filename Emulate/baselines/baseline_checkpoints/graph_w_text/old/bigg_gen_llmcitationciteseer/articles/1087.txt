In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is a crucial task that enables agents to achieve common goals. However, existing approaches rely on centralized controllers or assume complete knowledge of the system. We propose a decentralized coalition formation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective coalition structures from local interactions. Our approach, 'DecoForm', uses a novel attention mechanism to selectively incorporate information from neighboring agents, enabling scalable and adaptive coalition formation. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that DecoForm outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized methods in terms of coalition quality and stability.
