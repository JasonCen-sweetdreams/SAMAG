Graph-based neural networks have shown promise in information retrieval tasks, but their computational complexity hinders their application to large-scale document collections. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph convolutional network (H-GCN) architecture that leverages document hierarchies to reduce the computational overhead. Our approach represents documents as graphs, where nodes correspond to sentences and edges capture semantic relationships. We then apply a hierarchical GCN to learn document representations at multiple granularity levels. Experimental results on the Wikipedia corpus show that H-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art models in document retrieval tasks while reducing computational cost by up to 50%.
