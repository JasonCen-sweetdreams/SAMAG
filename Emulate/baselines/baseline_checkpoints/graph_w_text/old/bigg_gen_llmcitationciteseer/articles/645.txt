Voice assistants have the potential to enhance the independence and quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing systems often fail to accommodate their unique needs and abilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing adaptive voice assistants that can dynamically adjust their interaction style, dialogue flow, and feedback mechanisms based on the user's cognitive profile and real-time performance. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults with mild cognitive impairment and demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates, user satisfaction, and cognitive load reduction.
