Conventional information retrieval systems suffer from suboptimal ranking performance due to the complexity of user queries and the massive scale of document collections. This paper introduces a novel neural ranking model, 'NeuralQueryGraph', which represents user queries as graph-structured embeddings and adapts to the document collection through a hierarchical re-ranking strategy. Our approach leverages both local and global contextual information to improve ranking accuracy and reduces computational overhead by 30% compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate significant improvements in NDCG@10 and MAP scores.
