The increasing scale and complexity of distributed relational databases pose significant challenges to query optimization. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach, 'Distributed Query Graph' (DQG), which models the query optimization problem as a graph clustering problem. We develop an efficient algorithm that leverages the structural properties of the graph to identify optimal query plans. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database show that DQG outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
