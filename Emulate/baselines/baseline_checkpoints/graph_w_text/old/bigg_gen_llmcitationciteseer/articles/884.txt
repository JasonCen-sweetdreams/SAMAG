Traditional query expansion techniques rely on statistical models and manual feature engineering, leading to suboptimal performance in semantic search. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between queries and documents. NeuroQE utilizes a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query representation, document ranking, and relevance feedback. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
