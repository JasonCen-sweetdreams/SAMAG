Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing queries in such environments remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel distributed query optimization framework, 'DQO-MT', which leverages a combination of statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. Our approach considers the unique characteristics of multi-tenant workloads, including varying query patterns and resource contention. Experimental results on a real-world cloud database platform demonstrate that DQO-MT outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
