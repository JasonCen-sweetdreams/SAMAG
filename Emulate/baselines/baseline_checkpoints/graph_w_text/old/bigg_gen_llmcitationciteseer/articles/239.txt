This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the effects of gesture-based interaction on user experience and cognitive load. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, who performed a series of tasks in a VR setup using either gesture-based or controller-based interaction. Results show that gesture-based interaction led to improved spatial awareness, reduced cognitive load, and increased user engagement. We also found that users' gestures were influenced by their real-world motor experiences, supporting the embodied cognition hypothesis. Our findings have implications for the design of intuitive and immersive VR interfaces.
