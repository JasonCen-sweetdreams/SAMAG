Neural search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for text retrieval, but its effectiveness often hinges on the quality of the query representation. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion, wherein we learn term weights using a neural network to selectively incorporate relevant context terms from the query document. Our method, dubbed 'TermWeight', outperforms traditional query expansion techniques by adaptively adjusting term importance based on the specific query and document collection. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency, making TermWeight a promising solution for large-scale neural search applications.
