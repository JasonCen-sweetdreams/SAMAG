Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper introduces 'HGAN', a novel hierarchical graph attention network that jointly captures local and global patterns in time series data. HGAN leverages graph attention mechanisms to identify relevant features and nodes, enabling explainable anomaly detection. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and interpretability. We further provide a comprehensive analysis of the learned attention weights, revealing valuable insights into the anomaly detection process.
