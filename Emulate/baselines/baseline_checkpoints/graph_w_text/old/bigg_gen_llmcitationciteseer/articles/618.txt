Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution, network latency, and concurrent query execution. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach, 'RL-Optimizer', that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the query execution plan based on the system's current state. We demonstrate that RL-Optimizer achieves significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques, while adapting to changing system conditions.
