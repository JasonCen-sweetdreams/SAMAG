Distributed graph databases are increasingly used to store and query large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph summarization and machine learning-based cost estimation to efficiently optimize graph queries. We introduce a novel graph summarization technique that reduces the graph size while preserving query accuracy, and a cost estimation model that accurately predicts query execution times. Experimental results on a real-world graph database show that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
