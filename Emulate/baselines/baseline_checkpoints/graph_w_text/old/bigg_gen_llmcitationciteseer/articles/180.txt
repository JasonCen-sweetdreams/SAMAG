Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval to improve the retrieval effectiveness. However, the existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering and heuristics, which may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework, 'RL-QE', which learns to select the most informative expansion terms for a given query. Our approach formulates query expansion as a Markov decision process and uses deep Q-networks to learn the policy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
