As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible and user-friendly interfaces for older adults. Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have shown promise in reducing cognitive load for this demographic, but their effectiveness remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of ECAs on cognitive load, user satisfaction, and task performance in older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 30 participants, aged 65-85, who interacted with either an ECA or a traditional graphical user interface. Results show that the ECA group exhibited significantly lower cognitive load, higher user satisfaction, and improved task performance compared to the control group. Our findings have implications for the design of accessible interfaces for older adults and contribute to the ongoing discussion on the role of ECAs in HCI.
