Deep metric learning has achieved remarkable success in few-shot image classification tasks. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize to unseen classes and require large amounts of labeled data. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Prototype Network (HPN) that learns to generate class prototypes in a hierarchical manner, allowing for more effective knowledge transfer and improved few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HPN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to class imbalance.
