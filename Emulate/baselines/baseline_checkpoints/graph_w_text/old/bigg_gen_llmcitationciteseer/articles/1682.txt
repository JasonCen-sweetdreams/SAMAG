Traditional query optimization methods in information retrieval systems rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, often leading to suboptimal performance. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning-based framework, 'QLearn', for query optimization in document retrieval. QLearn leverages a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query execution plan, taking into account factors like index structure, query complexity, and document relevance. Experimental results on a large-scale text dataset demonstrate that QLearn outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques, achieving significant improvements in query response time and retrieval accuracy.
