Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but existing VR interfaces often exclude users with disabilities. This paper presents an inclusive VR interface design framework that incorporates accessibility features for users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a series of user studies and co-design workshops to identify key accessibility challenges and developed a set of guidelines for designing inclusive VR interactions. Our framework is evaluated through a case study of a VR-based educational application, demonstrating improved usability and accessibility for users with disabilities.
