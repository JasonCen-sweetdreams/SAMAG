Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) aims to represent entities and relations in a low-dimensional vector space. However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex hierarchical structures and relationships. We propose a novel KGE approach, HyperKG, which leverages hyperbolic geometry to model knowledge graphs. By exploiting the properties of hyperbolic spaces, HyperKG can effectively encode hierarchical and ontological relationships, leading to improved performance on link prediction and entity classification tasks. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HyperKG over state-of-the-art KGE methods.
