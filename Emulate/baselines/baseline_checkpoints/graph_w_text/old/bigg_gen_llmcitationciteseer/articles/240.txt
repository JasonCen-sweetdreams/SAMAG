Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are increasingly used in large-scale search applications. However, they often suffer from high query latency due to the overhead of indexing and retrieving documents from multiple machines. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, called HiIR, which partitions the index into multiple levels based on document similarity. We show that HiIR can significantly reduce query processing time by limiting the number of machines involved in the retrieval process. Experimental results on a large-scale DIR system demonstrate that HiIR achieves an average query speedup of 2.5x compared to traditional inverted indexing methods.
