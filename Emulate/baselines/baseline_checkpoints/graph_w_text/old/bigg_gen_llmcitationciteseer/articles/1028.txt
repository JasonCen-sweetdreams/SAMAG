Digital distractions, such as notifications from social media or email, significantly impact productivity and mental well-being. This paper presents a novel adaptive notification system, 'FocusAware', which learns to predict and mitigate distractions based on user behavior and context. We develop a machine learning model that incorporates features from user interaction logs, sensor data, and self-reported distractions to personalize notification filtering. A user study with 50 participants demonstrates that FocusAware reduces digital distractions by 35% and improves self-reported productivity by 27% compared to traditional notification systems.
