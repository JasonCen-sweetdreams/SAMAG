Neural ranking models have revolutionized information retrieval by capturing complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. However, these models often struggle to generalize to unseen queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel query expansion framework, 'PRF-NeuQE', which leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to adapt neural ranking models to the query context. By incorporating a reinforcement learning component, PRF-NeuQE iteratively refines the query representation, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval accuracy. Our experiments on the TREC-News and Robust04 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PRF-NeuQE in enhancing neural ranking models.
