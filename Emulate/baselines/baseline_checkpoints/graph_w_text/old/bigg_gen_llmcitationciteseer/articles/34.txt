Knowledge graphs (KGs) are increasingly used in various applications, but their utility is hindered by the presence of ambiguous entities. Existing entity disambiguation methods suffer from scalability issues, especially when dealing with large KGs. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GAT-ED', which leverages graph attention networks (GATs) to disambiguate entities in a scalable manner. We design a hierarchical GAT architecture that captures both local and global context, enabling effective disambiguation of entities with varying degrees of ambiguity. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GAT-ED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
