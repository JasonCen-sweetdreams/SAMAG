In distributed database systems, data replication is crucial for high availability and fault tolerance. However, maintaining consistency across replicas while ensuring low latency and high throughput remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to data replication using multi-tiered consensus protocols, which leverage a hierarchical architecture to reduce consensus latency and increase system scalability. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves up to 3x higher throughput and 2x lower latency compared to existing consensus-based replication schemes, while maintaining strong consistency guarantees.
