Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory study involving 20 older adults in the co-design of an inclusive voice assistant. We identify three key themes: simplification of language, visual augmentation, and personalized assistance. Our prototype, 'EasyVoice', incorporates these themes and is evaluated through a usability study, demonstrating significant improvements in older adults' ability to interact with voice assistants. We provide design recommendations for more inclusive voice assistants and highlight the importance of participatory design in HCI research.
