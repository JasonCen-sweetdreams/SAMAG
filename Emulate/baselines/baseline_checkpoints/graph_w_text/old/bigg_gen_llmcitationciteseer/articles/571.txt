Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it bridges the gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages deep semantic embeddings to capture the nuances of user intent. By integrating BERT-based language models with dense passage retrieval, CAQE generates expanded queries that better align with the original query context. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
