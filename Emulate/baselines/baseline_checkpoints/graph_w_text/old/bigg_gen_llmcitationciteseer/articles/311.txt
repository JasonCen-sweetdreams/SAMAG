Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems is a challenging task due to the complexity of graph data and the distributed nature of the system. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate query optimization as a Markov decision process and train an agent to learn an optimal policy for query execution. Our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query latency and resource utilization. We evaluate our approach on a real-world graph dataset and show significant improvements in query performance.
