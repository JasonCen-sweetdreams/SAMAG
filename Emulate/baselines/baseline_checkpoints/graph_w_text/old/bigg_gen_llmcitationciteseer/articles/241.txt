Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval that aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between the user's query and the relevant documents. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and heuristic-based techniques, which can be ineffective and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for query expansion, dubbed 'NeuroQE'. NeuroQE leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn informative query representations and expand them with relevant terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing the computational overhead.
