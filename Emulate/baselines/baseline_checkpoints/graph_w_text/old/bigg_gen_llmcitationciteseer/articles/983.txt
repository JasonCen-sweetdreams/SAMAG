Effective task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities must work together to achieve complex goals. This paper presents a novel approach to cooperative task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized, multi-agent Q-network that learns to assign tasks to agents based on their capabilities, task requirements, and environmental constraints. Our approach enables agents to adapt to changing task demands and learn from experience, leading to improved system performance and flexibility. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the superiority of our method over traditional, rule-based task allocation strategies.
