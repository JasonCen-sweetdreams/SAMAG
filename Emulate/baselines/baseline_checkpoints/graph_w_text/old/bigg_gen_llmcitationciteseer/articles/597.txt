Time series forecasting has seen significant advancements with the adoption of deep learning models. However, the lack of interpretability in these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that integrates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to provide explainable time series forecasting. Our approach allows for feature-level importance attribution and temporal attention visualization, enabling users to understand the underlying patterns driving the forecast. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance while providing insights into the decision-making process.
