Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack transparency and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies in time series data while providing explainable insights. HAN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify relevant features and time segments contributing to the anomaly. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for the detected anomalies.
