Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current gesture recognition systems often struggle to accommodate users with motor impairments. This paper presents a novel adaptive gesture recognition framework, 'EasyVR', which utilizes machine learning to dynamically adjust to individual users' abilities. We conduct a user study with 20 participants with diverse motor impairments, demonstrating that EasyVR significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems. Our findings have implications for the development of more inclusive VR experiences.
