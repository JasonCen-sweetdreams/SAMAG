Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to allocate tasks while considering their individual capabilities and limited communication resources. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn a distributed task allocation policy. Our method, called GNN-TA, represents the agent communication graph as a neural network and learns to predict task assignments based on agent features and graph structure. We show that GNN-TA outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of solution quality and scalability, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a simulated robotics scenario.
