Emotion recognition from multi-modal data (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the heterogeneous nature of the input data. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that leverages both intra-modal and inter-modal relationships to improve emotion recognition accuracy. Our HAN model consists of three stages: (1) modality-specific feature extraction, (2) intra-modal attention-based feature refinement, and (3) inter-modal attention-based fusion. Experimental results on the Multi-Modal Emotion Recognition (MERM) dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy and provides interpretable attention weights for explainability.
