Effective task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and constraints must coordinate to achieve complex goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework, 'AuctionMA', which leverages auction-based mechanisms to allocate tasks efficiently and fairly. Our approach utilizes a novel combination of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions and graph-based coalition formation to optimize task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that AuctionMA outperforms existing decentralized approaches in terms of task completion time and team utility.
