Few-shot node classification on graph-structured data remains a challenging task, particularly when dealing with scarce labeled samples. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both node and graph-level attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between nodes. HGAT adaptively selects relevant context nodes and aggregates their features to improve classification accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 12.5% on 5-shot node classification tasks.
