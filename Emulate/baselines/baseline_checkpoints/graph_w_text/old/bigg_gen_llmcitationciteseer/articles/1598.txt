This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents possess varying capabilities and resources. We propose a graph neural network (GNN) framework that learns to represent agent-agent interactions and allocate tasks efficiently. Our method, called HetGNN, leverages the structural properties of the agent communication graph to predict task assignments that minimize overall system latency and maximize resource utilization. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of HetGNN in achieving near-optimal task allocation compared to state-of-the-art decentralized methods.
