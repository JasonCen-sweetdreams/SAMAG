Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it aims to refine user queries to better match relevant documents. However, traditional expansion methods often rely on hand-crafted rules or simplistic statistical models. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to adaptively expand queries based on the semantic context of the query and document collection. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and robustness to query ambiguity.
