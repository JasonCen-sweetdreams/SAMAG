In this paper, we propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for coordinating multi-agent systems in dynamic task allocation scenarios. Our approach leverages a two-level hierarchy, where higher-level agents learn to allocate tasks to lower-level agents based on their capabilities and availability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated environment, where agents must adapt to changing task requirements and resource constraints. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms traditional decentralized approaches in terms of task completion rates and overall system efficiency.
