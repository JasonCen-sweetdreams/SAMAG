Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but its effectiveness is often limited by the quality of the expanded queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using reinforcement learning. We formulate query expansion as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to select relevant terms to add to the original query based on the rewards from the retrieval system. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as Rocchio and relevance feedback, in terms of mean average precision and NDCG.
