In multi-agent systems, autonomous negotiation is crucial for efficient resource allocation and conflict resolution. This paper presents a novel framework for autonomous negotiation in dynamic environments, where agents' preferences and priorities change over time. We introduce a hybrid approach combining game-theoretic and machine learning techniques to enable agents to adapt their negotiation strategies in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving negotiation outcomes and reducing communication overhead compared to existing methods.
