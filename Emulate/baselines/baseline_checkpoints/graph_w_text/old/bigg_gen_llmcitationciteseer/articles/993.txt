Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their language understanding capabilities are often biased towards dominant cultural and linguistic norms. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining the cultural and linguistic biases in popular voice assistants. We conducted a usability study with 50 participants from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds, revealing significant differences in recognition accuracy and user experience. We then developed a framework for inclusive voice assistant design, incorporating culturally sensitive language models and user-centered feedback mechanisms. Our evaluation demonstrates improved accuracy and user satisfaction for underrepresented groups, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in HCI.
