Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing join operations in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize join orders in distributed relational databases. Our method, dubbed 'JoinRL', uses a hierarchical neural network to learn the optimal join order based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that JoinRL outperforms state-of-the-art join optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
