Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various applications, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises serious concerns. This paper proposes an explainable AI-based approach to detect adversarial attacks in deep learning models. We develop a novel technique, 'XAI-AD', that utilizes feature importance and attention mechanisms to identify suspicious input patterns. Our approach is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing deep learning frameworks. Experimental results on popular datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XAI-AD in detecting adversarial attacks, even in the presence of sophisticated attack strategies.
