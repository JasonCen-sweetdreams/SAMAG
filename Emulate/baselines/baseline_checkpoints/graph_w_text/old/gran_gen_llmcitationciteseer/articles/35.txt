Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it helps to refine the search query and improve the relevance of retrieved documents. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We model the query and document graphs as heterogeneous graphs and propose a GCN-based architecture to learn the semantic relationships between words and documents. Our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, including word embeddings and pseudo-relevance feedback, on several benchmark datasets, including TREC and ClueWeb. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the retrieval performance and reducing the computational cost.
