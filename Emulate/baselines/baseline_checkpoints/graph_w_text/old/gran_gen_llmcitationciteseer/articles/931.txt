Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with disabilities. This paper presents an innovative VR interface design framework, 'AccessVR', which incorporates inclusive design principles to accommodate users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a user study with 30 participants with diverse abilities, demonstrating significant improvements in usability and user experience compared to existing VR interfaces. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive VR systems, enabling equal access to immersive experiences for all.
