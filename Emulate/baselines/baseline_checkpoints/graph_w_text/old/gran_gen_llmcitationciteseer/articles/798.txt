State-of-the-art neural ranking models for document retrieval often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HNRM-SE', which leverages semantic embeddings to capture nuanced document relationships. By incorporating a hierarchical attention mechanism, HNRM-SE efficiently aggregates relevance signals from multiple granularity levels, resulting in improved retrieval performance and reduced computational overhead. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HNRM-SE in retrieving relevant documents, outperforming existing neural ranking models while requiring fewer computational resources.
