This paper presents HAN-MARL, a novel hierarchical attention network architecture for explainable multi-agent reinforcement learning. HAN-MARL integrates attention mechanisms at both the agent and team levels to focus on relevant information exchanges and improve coordination. We demonstrate that HAN-MARL outperforms state-of-the-art MARL methods in complex environments, such as multi-robot navigation and resource allocation. Furthermore, our attention-based approach provides interpretable insights into agent decision-making, enabling effective human-AI collaboration.
