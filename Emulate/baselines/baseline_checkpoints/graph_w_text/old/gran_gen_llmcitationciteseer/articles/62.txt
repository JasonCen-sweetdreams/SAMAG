Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important in various applications, such as financial analytics and IoT sensor processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the massive volume and velocity of data. This paper presents a novel query optimization technique, QOCSI, which leverages column store indexing to accelerate query performance. We propose a cost-based optimization framework that dynamically selects the most efficient indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that QOCSI achieves an average query speedup of 3.2x compared to traditional row store indexing.
