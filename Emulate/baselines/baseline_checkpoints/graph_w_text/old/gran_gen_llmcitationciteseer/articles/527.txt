Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing intuitive interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in VR, where users' gestures and body language influence their interaction experience. We conducted a user study to investigate the effects of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load, user satisfaction, and task performance. Our results show that embodied cognition principles can significantly improve user experience and performance in VR applications, particularly in tasks requiring spatial awareness and manipulation.
