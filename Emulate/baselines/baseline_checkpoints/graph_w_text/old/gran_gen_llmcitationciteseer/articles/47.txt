Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud-based services, where multiple tenants share a common database infrastructure. However, optimizing queries in such environments poses significant challenges due to the varying resource demands and data distributions of different tenants. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MT-Optimizer', which leverages machine learning techniques to predict query performance and dynamically adjusts resource allocation. We evaluate MT-Optimizer on a real-world e-commerce dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query efficiency and overall system throughput compared to existing optimization techniques.
