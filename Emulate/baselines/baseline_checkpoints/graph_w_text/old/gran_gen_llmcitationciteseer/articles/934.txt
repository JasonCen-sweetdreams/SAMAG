Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc information retrieval, aiming to bridge the gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. Our model incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively emphasize relevant terms and phrases in the query, and a contrastive learning objective to capture nuanced semantic relationships. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
