Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in various applications, but its vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised significant concerns. This paper proposes a novel defense mechanism, 'AdveMA', which leverages multi-agent games to improve the robustness of DRL agents. We design a framework where multiple agents compete and cooperate to develop a robust policy, thereby increasing the agent's resistance to adversarial perturbations. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that AdveMA significantly enhances the robustness of DRL agents while maintaining their performance in the presence of attacks.
