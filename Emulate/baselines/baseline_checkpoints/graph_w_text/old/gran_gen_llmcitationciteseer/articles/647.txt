Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR interfaces often exclude this population due to their complexity. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CARE-VR', a novel VR interface tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a participatory design process with caregivers and older adults to identify key design considerations, including simplification of navigation, high-contrast visual cues, and multimodal feedback. A user study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to a standard VR interface.
