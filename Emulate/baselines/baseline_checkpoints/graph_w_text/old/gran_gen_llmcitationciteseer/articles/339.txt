Distributed relational databases are increasingly popular in modern data management systems. However, optimizing query execution plans in such systems remains a major challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and network topology. This paper proposes a novel graph-based query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph theory to model data dependencies and communication costs. We develop a set of efficient heuristics that exploit the structural properties of the graph to identify near-optimal query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt reduces query execution times by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
