Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that not only detects anomalies with high accuracy but also provides interpretable explanations for its decisions. Our HAN model learns to focus on relevant segments of the time series data at multiple scales, allowing it to capture complex patterns and relationships. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving anomaly detection performance and providing insightful explanations.
