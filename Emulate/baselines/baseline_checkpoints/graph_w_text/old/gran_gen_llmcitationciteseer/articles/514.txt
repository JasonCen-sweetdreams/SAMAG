The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion in time-series data, rendering traditional indexing techniques inefficient for real-time query processing. This paper proposes 'TSIndex', a novel indexing framework that leverages the periodicity and seasonality inherent in time-series data to accelerate query execution. TSIndex employs a hierarchical indexing structure that adapts to the data distribution and query patterns, resulting in significant reductions in query latency and storage overhead. Our experimental evaluation on diverse time-series datasets demonstrates the superiority of TSIndex over state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
