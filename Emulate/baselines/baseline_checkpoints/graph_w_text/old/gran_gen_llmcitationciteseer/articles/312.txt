Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance and healthcare. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates explainable attention mechanisms to identify anomalies in time-series data. Our approach leverages a multi-scale attention framework to capture local and global patterns, enabling the model to focus on relevant segments of the time series. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while providing meaningful explanations for its predictions.
