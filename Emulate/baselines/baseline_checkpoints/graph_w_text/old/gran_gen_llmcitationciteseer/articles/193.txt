Multi-tenant database systems (MTDBS) have become increasingly popular in cloud-based applications. However, optimizing query performance in MTDBS remains a challenging task due to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the workload. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database system. Our experiments on a real-world MTDBS benchmark show that the RL-based approach outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
