Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale document collections. However, the high latency and communication overhead associated with query processing remain significant challenges. This paper presents a novel approach to improve query efficiency in DIR systems using hierarchical clustering. Our method, called HierClusDIR, leverages clustering to group similar documents and reduce the number of nodes involved in query processing. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HierClusDIR achieves an average query latency reduction of 37% compared to state-of-the-art DIR systems, while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy.
