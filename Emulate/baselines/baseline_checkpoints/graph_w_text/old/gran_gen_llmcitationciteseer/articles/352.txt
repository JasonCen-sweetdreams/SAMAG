This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive traffic signal control using coordinated autonomous agents. We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to learn optimal policies for traffic signal control in real-time, taking into account dynamic traffic patterns and road network conditions. Our approach incorporates a decentralized architecture, where each agent communicates with its neighbors to coordinate signal timings and minimize congestion. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional fixed-time signal control strategies.
