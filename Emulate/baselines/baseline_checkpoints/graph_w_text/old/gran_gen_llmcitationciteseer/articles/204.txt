Individuals with motor impairments face significant barriers when interacting with computers, as traditional gesture recognition systems are often designed for able-bodied users. This paper presents an adaptive gesture recognition framework that learns to recognize and accommodate the unique motor patterns of users with impairments. Our approach combines machine learning algorithms with participatory design principles, involving users with impairments in the design process to ensure that the system is tailored to their needs. We evaluate our framework on a dataset of gestures collected from users with various motor impairments, demonstrating improved recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
