Document retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents from a large corpus given a query. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages hierarchical graph attention networks (HGAT) to model the complex relationships between documents and queries. Our HGAT model consists of multiple layers, each of which captures different levels of abstraction in the document-query graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
