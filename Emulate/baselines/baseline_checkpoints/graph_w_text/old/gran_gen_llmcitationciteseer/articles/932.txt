Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, as it resolves ambiguity between entities with identical names. This paper proposes a novel approach, KG-EmbD, which leverages deep learning-based embeddings to capture semantic relationships between entities. KG-EmbD combines a graph attention mechanism with a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify and disambiguate entities. Our experiments on the WikiData dataset demonstrate that KG-EmbD outperforms state-of-the-art entity disambiguation methods, achieving an F1-score of 0.93 and improving knowledge graph quality by 12%.
