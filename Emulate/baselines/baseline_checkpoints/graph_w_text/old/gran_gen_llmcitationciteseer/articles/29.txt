Distributed database systems face significant challenges in optimizing query execution plans, which can lead to substantial performance degradation. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', learns to select optimal query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards or penalties based on query execution times. We demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based optimization techniques and is more adaptable to changing workload conditions. Experimental results on a distributed database benchmark show an average query execution time reduction of 23% compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods.
