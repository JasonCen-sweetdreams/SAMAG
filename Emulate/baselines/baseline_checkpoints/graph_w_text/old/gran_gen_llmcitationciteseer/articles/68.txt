Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, where the goal is to predict the labels of nodes based on their features and graph structure. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAT-GNN) that leverages the hierarchical structure of graphs to improve node classification. Our approach uses a stacked architecture of graph attention layers, each of which focuses on different levels of graph hierarchy. We evaluate HAT-GNN on several benchmark datasets and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks.
