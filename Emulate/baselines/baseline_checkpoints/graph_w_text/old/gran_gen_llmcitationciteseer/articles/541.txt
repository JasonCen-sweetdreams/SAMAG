The proliferation of diverse data sources has created a pressing need for efficient data integration methods. This paper presents 'GraphMap', a novel graph-based approach for integrating heterogeneous data sources. GraphMap leverages a probabilistic graph model to capture complex relationships between data entities, enabling accurate data mapping and entity disambiguation. We evaluate GraphMap on a large-scale dataset comprising structured and unstructured data sources, demonstrating significant improvements in data integration quality and scalability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
