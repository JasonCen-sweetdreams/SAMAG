Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has witnessed significant advancements with the emergence of dense retrieval techniques. However, these methods often rely on computationally expensive similarity computations between the question and passage embeddings. This paper proposes a novel approach, DDR-PR, which leverages a deep dense retrieval model to efficiently retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus. Our method employs a hierarchical clustering strategy to prune the search space and reduce the number of similarity computations. Experimental results on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate the efficacy of DDR-PR, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing the inference time by up to 3x compared to existing dense retrieval methods.
