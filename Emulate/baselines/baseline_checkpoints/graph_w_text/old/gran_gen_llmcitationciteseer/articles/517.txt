This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems for real-time traffic management using hierarchical reinforcement learning. Our framework, 'TrafficOPT', consists of a hierarchical agent architecture that integrates macroscopic and microscopic traffic management strategies. The top-level agent learns to optimize traffic signal control policies, while the bottom-level agents adapt to local traffic conditions using Q-learning. We evaluate TrafficOPT on a realistic traffic simulator and demonstrate improved traffic flow, reduced congestion, and increased passenger throughput compared to traditional traffic management approaches.
