In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism, 'DMA', which enables agents to bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We introduce a novel bidding strategy that incorporates both task urgency and agent workload, ensuring that tasks are allocated to the most suitable agents. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that DMA achieves near-optimal task allocation while reducing communication overhead and improving system scalability.
