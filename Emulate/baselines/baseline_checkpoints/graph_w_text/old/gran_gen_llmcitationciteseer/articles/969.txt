In multi-agent systems, trust is a crucial aspect for effective collaboration and decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical reputation framework, HRF, which enables agents to reason about the trustworthiness of their peers. HRF leverages a probabilistic modeling approach to aggregate reputation scores from multiple sources, incorporating both direct and indirect trust relationships. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HRF in a simulated supply chain management scenario, showing improved trust accuracy and robustness against malicious agents. The proposed framework has broad applications in various domains, including e-commerce, smart grids, and autonomous vehicles.
