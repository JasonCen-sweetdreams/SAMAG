Distributed databases are increasingly used to store and process large amounts of data. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical partitioning scheme to optimize query performance on distributed databases. Our approach uses a combination of vertical and horizontal partitioning to minimize data transfer and reduce query latency. We develop an efficient cost model to guide the partitioning process and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a real-world dataset. Results show that our method achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance compared to state-of-the-art partitioning schemes.
