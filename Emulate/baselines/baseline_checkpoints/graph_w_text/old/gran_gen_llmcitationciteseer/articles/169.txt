Virtual reality (VR) navigation can be cognitively overwhelming due to the vast amount of information presented. This paper introduces 'GazeRec', a novel gaze-based intelligent recommendation system that leverages machine learning and human-computer interaction principles to personalize VR navigation experiences. GazeRec infers user intent from gaze patterns and generates context-aware recommendations to reduce information overload. Our user study demonstrates that GazeRec significantly improves navigation efficiency and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR navigation methods.
