Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to creating inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant prototype that incorporates features such as speech adaptation, personalized feedback, and multimodal interaction. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rate, user satisfaction, and accessibility compared to commercial voice assistants.
