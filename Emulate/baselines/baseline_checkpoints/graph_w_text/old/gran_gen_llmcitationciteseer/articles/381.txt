Blockchain-based database systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential to provide decentralized, secure, and transparent data management. However, ensuring the consistency and reliability of transactions in such systems remains a major challenge. This paper proposes a novel distributed transaction management framework, 'BlockTx', which guarantees Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) properties for blockchain-based database systems. Our approach leverages a combination of smart contracts, two-phase commit protocols, and conflict resolution mechanisms to ensure correct and efficient transaction execution. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of BlockTx in maintaining data consistency and improving transaction throughput in blockchain-based database systems.
