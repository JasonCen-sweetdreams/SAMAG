Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessible interfaces for users with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible VR interfaces for individuals with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops and usability studies to identify key accessibility challenges and developed a set of guidelines for designing inclusive VR interfaces. Our proposed framework, 'AccessibleVR', incorporates a range of adaptive features, such as customizable font sizes, audio descriptions, and gesture-based navigation, to ensure equal access to VR experiences.
