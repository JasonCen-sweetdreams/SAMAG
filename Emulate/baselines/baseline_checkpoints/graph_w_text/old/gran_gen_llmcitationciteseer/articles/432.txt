In complex, uncertain environments, effective coalition formation among autonomous agents is crucial for achieving common goals. This paper presents a novel, scalable framework for multi-agent coalition formation that incorporates uncertainty modeling and adaptive decision-making. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to learn coalition structures and Bayesian inference to update uncertainty estimates. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate improved coalition stability and task completion rates compared to existing methods, showcasing the potential of our framework for real-world applications.
