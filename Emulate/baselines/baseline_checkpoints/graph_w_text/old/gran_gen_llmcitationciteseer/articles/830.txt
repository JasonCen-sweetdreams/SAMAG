Quantum circuit synthesis is a critical task in quantum computing, requiring the optimization of complex quantum circuits. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture, which leverages the structure of quantum circuits to learn effective synthesis strategies. Our approach represents quantum circuits as hierarchical graphs, enabling the attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships between gates. Experimental results on a diverse set of quantum circuits demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art synthesis methods, achieving higher fidelity and reduced gate counts.
