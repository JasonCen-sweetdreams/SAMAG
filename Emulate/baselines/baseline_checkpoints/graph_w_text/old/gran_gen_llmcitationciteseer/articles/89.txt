Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called QOptRL, learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. We evaluate QOptRL on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance compared to traditional optimization techniques.
