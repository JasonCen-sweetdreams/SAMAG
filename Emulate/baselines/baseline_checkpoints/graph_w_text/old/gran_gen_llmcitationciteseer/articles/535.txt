The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors has led to an explosion of time-series data streams, posing significant challenges for efficient query processing. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'TS-Grid', which leverages a grid-based partitioning strategy to enable fast and scalable query execution on time-series data streams. We introduce a dynamic indexing framework that adaptively adjusts the grid resolution based on query patterns and data distributions, resulting in improved query performance and reduced storage overhead. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-Grid in supporting various query types, including range, aggregation, and join queries.
