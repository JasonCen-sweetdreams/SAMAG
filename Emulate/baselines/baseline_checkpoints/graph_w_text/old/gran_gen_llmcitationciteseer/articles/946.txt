Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our framework, 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database's workload and system dynamics. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional rule-based query optimizers, achieving an average reduction of 30% in query execution time.
