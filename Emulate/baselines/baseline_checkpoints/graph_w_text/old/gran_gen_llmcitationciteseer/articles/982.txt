This paper presents a human-centered design approach to developing accessible conversational interfaces for older adults in the context of voice-controlled smart home systems. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 older adults (65+ years) to identify the challenges and opportunities of using voice assistants in smart home environments. Our findings highlight the importance of cognitive support, error prevention, and personalized feedback in designing conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of older adults. We propose a set of design guidelines and recommendations for improving the accessibility and usability of voice-controlled smart home systems for this demographic.
