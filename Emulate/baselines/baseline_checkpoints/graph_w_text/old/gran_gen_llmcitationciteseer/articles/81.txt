Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, identifying key challenges and areas for improvement in existing voice assistants. Our findings informed the development of 'ElderVoice', a prototype voice assistant that incorporates age-related accessibility features, such as simplified language processing and visual feedback. A usability evaluation with 20 older adults showed significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
