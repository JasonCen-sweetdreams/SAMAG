In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. Transparency and interpretability of these interactions are crucial for trust and accountability. This paper introduces HAN-MAD, a novel hierarchical attention network that learned to explain the decision-making process of multiple agents. By recursively applying attention mechanisms to agent-agent and agent-environment interactions, HAN-MAD uncovers hierarchical relationships and identifies influential factors. Experimental results on a real-world traffic simulation dataset demonstrate that HAN-MAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in decision-making accuracy while providing meaningful explanations.
