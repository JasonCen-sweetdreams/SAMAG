Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a complex challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed graph databases. We design a Markov decision process to model the query optimization problem and develop a deep Q-network-based algorithm to learn optimal query plans. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and improves system throughput by up to 2x.
