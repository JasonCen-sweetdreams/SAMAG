This paper presents a study on designing virtual reality (VR) experiences that are accessible and engaging for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a user-centered design process involving 20 participants, incorporating cognitive assessments and usability testing to inform the development of a VR system. Our results show that a personalized, simplified, and multimodal interface can improve user experience and cognitive load for this population. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of inclusive VR applications and provide guidelines for practitioners.
