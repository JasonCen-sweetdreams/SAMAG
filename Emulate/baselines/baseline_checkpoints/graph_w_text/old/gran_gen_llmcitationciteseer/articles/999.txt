Cloud computing has revolutionized the way resources are allocated and utilized. However, efficient resource allocation remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hybrid agent-based architecture that combines the strengths of both centralized and decentralized approaches. Our framework utilizes a hierarchical agent structure, where local agents optimize resource allocation within individual nodes, while a global agent coordinates and balances resource utilization across the cloud. Experimental results on a simulated cloud environment demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and overall system efficiency.
