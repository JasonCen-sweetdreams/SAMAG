Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in molecular property prediction, but their scalability and inductive learning capabilities remain limited. This paper proposes a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages multi-scale graph representations to learn hierarchical relationships between atoms and functional groups. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on large-scale molecular datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on molecular property prediction tasks while significantly reducing computational costs. Furthermore, we show that HGAT can generalize well to unseen molecules and tasks, making it a promising approach for molecular design and discovery.
