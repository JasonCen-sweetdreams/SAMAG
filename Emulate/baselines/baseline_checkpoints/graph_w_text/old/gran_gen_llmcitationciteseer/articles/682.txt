Resource allocation in IoT networks is a complex problem due to the scale and heterogeneity of devices. This paper proposes a decentralized agent-based approach, 'IoT-Agent', which leverages multi-agent systems to allocate resources efficiently. Each agent represents an IoT device and communicates with its neighbors to negotiate resource usage. We introduce a novel auction-based mechanism that ensures fairness and optimizes resource utilization. Experiments on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that IoT-Agent outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of resource efficiency and adaptability to changing network conditions.
