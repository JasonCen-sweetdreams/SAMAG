Few-shot image classification remains a challenging task in computer vision, particularly when faced with limited labeled data. This paper presents HierCon, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework that leverages self-supervised learning to improve few-shot classification performance. HierCon integrates a novel hierarchical representation learning module, which captures both local and global features, with a contrastive loss function that encourages semantic embed-ding learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HierCon on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-shot classification scenarios while requiring significantly fewer labeled samples.
