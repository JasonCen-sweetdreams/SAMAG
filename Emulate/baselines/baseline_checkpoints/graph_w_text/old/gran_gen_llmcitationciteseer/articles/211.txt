Graph pattern matching is a fundamental operation in graph databases, but its scalability is limited by the complexity of subgraph isomorphism testing. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphRel', which leverages relational databases to efficiently process graph pattern matching queries on large-scale datasets. We introduce a novel indexing scheme that exploits the relational structure to prune the search space, and a distributed query evaluation strategy that minimizes cross-node communication. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphRel outperforms state-of-the-art graph databases by up to 3 orders of magnitude in terms of query response time.
