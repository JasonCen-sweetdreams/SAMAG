Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their usability for older adults remains a concern. This study investigates the design of accessible voice assistants for older adults, focusing on multimodal interaction techniques. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, exploring the effects of visual, auditory, and tactile feedback on task completion rates and user experience. Our results show that a multimodal approach significantly improves interaction accuracy and reduces frustration, particularly for individuals with hearing or visual impairments. We present design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants and discuss implications for future research in accessible HCI.
