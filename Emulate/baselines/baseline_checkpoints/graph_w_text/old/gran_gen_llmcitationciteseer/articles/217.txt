This paper examines the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in virtual reality (VR) environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, who were randomly assigned to interact with either a generic or personalized avatar in a VR game. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars reported higher levels of engagement, enjoyment, and self-presence compared to those who interacted with generic avatars. We also found that personalized avatars led to increased user retention and reduced feelings of anxiety. Our findings have implications for the design of VR experiences, suggesting that personalized avatars can be a crucial factor in enhancing user engagement and overall experience.
