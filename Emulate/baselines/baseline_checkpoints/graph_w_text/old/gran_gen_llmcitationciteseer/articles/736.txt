In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to heterogeneous agents. Our method, called GNN-TA, represents the agent graph as a dynamic neural network, allowing agents to learn and adapt to changing task requirements and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a variety of scenarios demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized methods, achieving improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead.
