Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it significantly impacts system performance. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on hand-crafted rules and heuristics, which may not adapt well to dynamic workloads. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. Our method, called 'QueryRL', learns to predict the optimal query plan by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a realistic distributed database setup demonstrate that QueryRL outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
