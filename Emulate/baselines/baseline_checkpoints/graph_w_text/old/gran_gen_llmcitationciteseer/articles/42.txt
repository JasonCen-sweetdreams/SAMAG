Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data workloads. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time. We also demonstrate the scalability of our approach on a distributed database system with thousands of nodes.
