Autonomous agents operating in decentralized environments require robust trust management mechanisms to ensure secure interactions. This paper proposes a blockchain-based reputation system, 'AgentRep', that leverages decentralized consensus protocols to establish trust among autonomous agents. AgentRep utilizes a novel reputation metric that incorporates agent behavior, interaction history, and community feedback, enabling agents to make informed decisions about collaboration and resource sharing. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of AgentRep in promoting cooperation and mitigating malicious behavior in decentralized agent networks.
