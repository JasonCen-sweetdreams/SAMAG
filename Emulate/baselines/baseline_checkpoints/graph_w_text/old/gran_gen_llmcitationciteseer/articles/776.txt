Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'RL-Opt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively select efficient execution plans. Our approach exploits the Markov decision process (MDP) formulation to model the query optimization problem, and employs a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn an optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
