We propose a novel decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, enabling efficient and scalable coordination in complex, dynamic environments. Our approach leverages distributed constraint optimization techniques to assign tasks to agents while respecting resource constraints and minimizing interference. Experimental results demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to centralized allocation methods. This framework has broad applications in areas such as multi-robot systems, smart cities, and IoT networks.
