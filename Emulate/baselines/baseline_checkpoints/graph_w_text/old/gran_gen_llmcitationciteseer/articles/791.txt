Time series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, including healthcare and finance. However, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network, 'HATAN', which leverages self-attention mechanisms to identify relevant temporal and spatial patterns in multivariate time series data. Our approach generates attention weights that provide insight into the contribution of individual features and time steps to the anomaly detection process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HATAN in detecting anomalies while offering meaningful explanations.
