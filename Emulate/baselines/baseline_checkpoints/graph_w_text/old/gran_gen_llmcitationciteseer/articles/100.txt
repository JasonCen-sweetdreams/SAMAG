Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance and healthcare. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying anomaly patterns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAT) that integrates both local and global attention mechanisms to identify anomalies in time-series data. Our approach enables explainable anomaly detection by providing insights into the relevant time-series segments and features contributing to the anomalies. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAT in detecting anomalies and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
