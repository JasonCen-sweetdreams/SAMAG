Online conflicts often escalate due to the lack of emotional understanding and empathy between individuals. This paper introduces 'EmpaTech', a novel human-computer interaction framework that leverages emotive avatars to facilitate conflict resolution in online communities. Our approach uses machine learning-based sentiment analysis to detect emotional cues in user messages and responsive avatars to provide empathetic feedback. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, demonstrating that EmpaTech significantly increases emotional understanding and reduces conflict escalation in online discussions.
