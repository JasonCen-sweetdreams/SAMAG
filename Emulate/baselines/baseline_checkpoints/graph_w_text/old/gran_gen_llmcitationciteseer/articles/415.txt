In-memory column-store databases have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to efficiently process analytical workloads. However, optimizing query execution plans for these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies based on query patterns and database statistics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional cost-based optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x in query execution time.
