Multi-agent systems have numerous applications in real-world domains, but their scalability is often limited by the complexity of coordination mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel approach to multi-agent coordination using deep hierarchical reinforcement learning. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that decomposes the coordination problem into smaller sub-problems and uses a deep reinforcement learning framework to learn effective coordination strategies. Experimental results on a variety of multi-agent domains demonstrate that our approach can scale to large numbers of agents while achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
