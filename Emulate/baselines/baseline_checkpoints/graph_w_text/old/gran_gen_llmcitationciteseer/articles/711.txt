Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable results, but existing methods often rely on simplistic or isolated feature attributions. This paper proposes a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that integrates multi-scale graph embeddings to model complex user-item relationships. HGAT adaptively learns to attend to relevant nodes and edges, generating personalized explanations for recommendations. Our experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
