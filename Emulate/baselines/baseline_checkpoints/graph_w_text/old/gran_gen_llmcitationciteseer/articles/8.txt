As robots increasingly interact with humans in shared workspaces, efficient intention recognition is crucial for safe and effective collaboration. This paper presents a novel gaze-based approach to recognize human intentions in real-time, leveraging deep learning-based gaze tracking and intention inference models. Our approach is evaluated on a comprehensive dataset of human-robot collaboration scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in intention recognition accuracy and latency compared to existing methods. The proposed framework has the potential to enhance human-robot collaboration in various domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, and assistive robotics.
