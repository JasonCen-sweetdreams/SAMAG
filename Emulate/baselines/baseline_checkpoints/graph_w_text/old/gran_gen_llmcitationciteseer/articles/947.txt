Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments require efficient learning strategies to adapt to changing task requirements. This paper presents HATL, a hierarchical task learning framework that enables agents to learn high-level tasks by composing low-level skills. HATL leverages a graph-based representation of tasks and skills, allowing agents to reason about task dependencies and adapt to new situations. Experimental results in simulated robotic environments demonstrate that HATL outperforms flat learning approaches in terms of task completion rate and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
