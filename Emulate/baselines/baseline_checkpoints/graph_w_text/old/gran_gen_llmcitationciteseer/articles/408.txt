Cloud providers face significant challenges in efficiently allocating resources to multiple tenants while ensuring service-level agreements. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'CloudOptimizer', which leverages a multi-agent architecture to optimize resource allocation in real-time. We employ a hybrid deep Q-network and actor-critic algorithm to learn complex patterns in tenant demand and adapt to changing workloads. Experimental results on a large-scale cloud simulation platform demonstrate that CloudOptimizer reduces resource waste by up to 35% and improves tenant satisfaction by 25% compared to state-of-the-art static allocation strategies.
