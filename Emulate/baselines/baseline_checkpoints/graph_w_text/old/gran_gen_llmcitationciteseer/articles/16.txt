Query expansion is a crucial step in improving the accuracy of knowledge graph-based question answering systems. However, existing approaches often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion method, 'HQE', which leverages the structural properties of knowledge graphs to efficiently identify relevant entities and relationships. HQE uses a graph attention mechanism to selectively expand queries based on their semantic relevance, reducing the search space and improving retrieval efficiency. Experimental results on the YAGO and DBpedia datasets demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
