Multi-agent planning under uncertainty is a challenging problem due to the exponential growth of the joint action space. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach, called Hierarchical Distributed Planning (HDP), which leverages a hierarchical task representation to reduce the planning complexity. HDP involves two phases: (1) high-level task decomposition into sub-tasks, and (2) distributed planning among agents to execute the sub-tasks. We develop a probabilistic reasoning framework to model uncertainty and evaluate the hierarchical plan's feasibility. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HDP outperforms existing decentralized planning methods in terms of plan quality and computational efficiency.
