Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for applications like predictive maintenance and fault detection. While deep learning models have shown promise, they often lack interpretability, making it difficult to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explanations. Our approach learns to focus on relevant segments and features in the time-series data using a hierarchical attention mechanism. We evaluate HAN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting anomalies while providing insights into the anomaly patterns.
