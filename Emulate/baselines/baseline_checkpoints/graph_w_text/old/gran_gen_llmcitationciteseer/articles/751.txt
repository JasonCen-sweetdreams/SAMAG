This paper presents a novel approach to gesture recognition systems that adapts to the abilities and needs of individuals with motor impairments. We propose a machine learning-based framework that leverages a combination of sensors, including electromyography, accelerometer, and computer vision, to recognize gestures in real-time. Our system allows users to customize the gesture vocabulary and adapts to changes in their motor abilities over time. We evaluate our approach through a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments, demonstrating improved recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
