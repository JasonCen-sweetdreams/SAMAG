Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) has become a critical component of modern business intelligence, enabling timely insights from massive datasets. However, optimizing query workloads to meet latency constraints remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces 'ART', a novel adaptive tuple routing framework that dynamically reconfigures query plans based on real-time workload analysis. By leveraging machine learning models to predict query patterns, ART achieves an average latency reduction of 37% compared to traditional query optimization techniques. We evaluate ART on a large-scale RTDW system, demonstrating its effectiveness in supporting high-performance analytics workloads.
