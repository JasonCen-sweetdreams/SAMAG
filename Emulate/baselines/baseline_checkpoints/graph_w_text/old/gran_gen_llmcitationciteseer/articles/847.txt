In this paper, we present EmoType, a novel approach to infer users' affective states from their typing dynamics on keyboards. Our system utilizes a combination of machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques to analyze keystroke timing, pressure, and rhythm patterns. We demonstrate that EmoType can accurately classify users' emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, frustration) with an average F1-score of 0.87. We also explore the potential applications of EmoType in HCI, including real-time emotional feedback, personalized interfaces, and affective computing. Our findings have significant implications for designing more empathetic and human-centered computing systems.
