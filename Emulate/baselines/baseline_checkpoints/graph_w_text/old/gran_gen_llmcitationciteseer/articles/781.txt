Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it directly affects the quality of search results. Traditional techniques rely on manual feature engineering and lexical analysis, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'NeuroQE', that learns to generate effective query expansions from a large corpus of text data. Our model leverages a combination of word embeddings, convolutional neural networks, and attention mechanisms to capture semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
