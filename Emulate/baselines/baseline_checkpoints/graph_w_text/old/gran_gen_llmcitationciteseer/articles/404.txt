This paper presents a gaze-based interaction system for virtual reality (VR) environments, leveraging deep learning techniques to improve user experience. Our approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and track the user's gaze in real-time, enabling accurate and intuitive object selection and manipulation. We evaluate our system in a series of user studies, demonstrating significant improvements in interaction efficiency and user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based methods. The proposed system has implications for various VR applications, including gaming, education, and healthcare.
