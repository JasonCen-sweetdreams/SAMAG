Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their effectiveness is hindered by the 'accent gap' â€“ the failure to recognize and respond accurately to diverse speech patterns. This paper presents an exploratory study examining the speech patterns of older adults (65+ years) with varying levels of cognitive and physical abilities. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, collecting speech data and conducting contextual interviews. Our findings highlight the importance of considering age-related changes in speech, such as slower speech rates and increased filler words, to improve voice assistant design. We propose a set of design recommendations for developing more inclusive voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults.
