Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems face challenges in capturing complex relationships between medical concepts. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the semantic relationships between medical entities. Our GNN-based model learns to represent queries as graphs, enabling the incorporation of domain knowledge and contextual information. Experimental results on the TREC Medical Retrieval benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for complex queries. Our approach has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of MIR systems, ultimately leading to better healthcare outcomes.
