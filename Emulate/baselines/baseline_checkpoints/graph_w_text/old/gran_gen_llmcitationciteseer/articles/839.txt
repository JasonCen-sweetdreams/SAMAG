In this paper, we present a novel distributed task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'HRL-TA', leverages a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn task allocation policies that adapt to changing environmental conditions and agent capabilities. We evaluate HRL-TA on a realistic disaster response scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization-based approaches. Our results have implications for real-world applications such as search and rescue operations, environmental monitoring, and smart cities.
