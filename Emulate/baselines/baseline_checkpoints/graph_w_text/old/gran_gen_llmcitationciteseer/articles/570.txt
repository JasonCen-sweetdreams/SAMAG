Optimizing query performance is a crucial task in distributed database systems. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on manual tuning and heuristics, leading to suboptimal query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn query optimization strategies. We represent database schemas and queries as graphs, and train a GNN model to predict optimal query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, reducing query latency by up to 40%. Our methodology can be easily integrated into existing database systems, enabling more efficient query processing and improved system performance.
