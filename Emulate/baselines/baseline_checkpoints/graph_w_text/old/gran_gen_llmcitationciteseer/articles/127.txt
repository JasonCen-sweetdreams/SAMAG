Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources to meet dynamic workload demands. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'CloudAllocator', which learns to optimize resource allocation based on historical workload patterns and real-time system metrics. Our approach leverages a multi-agent DRL architecture, where each agent represents a cloud resource type, to adaptively allocate resources and minimize service level agreement (SLA) violations. Experimental results on a large-scale cloud dataset demonstrate that CloudAllocator outperforms traditional heuristic-based allocation methods, achieving up to 25% reduction in SLA violations and 30% improvement in resource utilization.
