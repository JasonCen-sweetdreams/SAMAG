Distributed database systems (DDBS) are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query execution plans in response to dynamic workloads and system conditions. Our approach, called 'ElasticQuery', uses a deep Q-network to select the optimal plan based on a reward function that balances query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a simulated DDBS show that ElasticQuery outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of average query response time.
