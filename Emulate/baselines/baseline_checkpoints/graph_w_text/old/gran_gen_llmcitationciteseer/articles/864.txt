Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution in DDS remains a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of distributed systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query planning. Experimental results on a real-world DDS dataset demonstrate that our RL-based approach outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimization methods by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
