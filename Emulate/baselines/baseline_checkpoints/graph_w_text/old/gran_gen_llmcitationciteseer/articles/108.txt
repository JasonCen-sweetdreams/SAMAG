In dynamic environments, efficient task allocation is crucial for multi-agent systems to achieve their objectives. This paper proposes a novel coordination framework, 'DynTA', which leverages a hybrid approach combining decentralized Markov decision processes (MDPs) with centralized optimization. DynTA adapts to changing environmental conditions and agent capabilities, ensuring optimal task allocation and minimizing redundant efforts. We evaluate DynTA in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved response times and reduced resource waste compared to existing methods.
