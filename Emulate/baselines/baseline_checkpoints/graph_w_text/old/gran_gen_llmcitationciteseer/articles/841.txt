Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promising results in various applications, but the lack of interpretability hinders its adoption in high-stakes domains. This paper introduces HAN-MARL, a novel Hierarchical Attention Network architecture that enables explainable decision-making in MARL. Our approach leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, providing insights into the decision-making process. We evaluate HAN-MARL on a range of cooperative and competitive MARL tasks, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods.
