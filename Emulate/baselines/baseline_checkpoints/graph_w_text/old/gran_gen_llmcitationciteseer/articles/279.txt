Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods often rely on simplistic feature importance scores or cumbersome model-agnostic techniques. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that integrates graph neural networks with attention mechanisms to provide transparent and personalized recommendations. HGAT leverages user-item interactions as graph structures, allowing it to capture complex relationships and generate intuitive explanations. Our experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
