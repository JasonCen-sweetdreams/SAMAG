Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of database schema, data distribution, and network topology. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that the RL-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
