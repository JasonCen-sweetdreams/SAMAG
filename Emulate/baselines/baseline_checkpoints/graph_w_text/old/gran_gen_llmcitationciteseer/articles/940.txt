In large-scale multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our method, called DAGAT, represents agent interactions as a graph and learns to allocate tasks by predicting the optimal assignment of agents to tasks. DAGAT outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of scalability and adaptability to changing environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DAGAT in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, where agents must cooperate to locate survivors in a disaster zone.
