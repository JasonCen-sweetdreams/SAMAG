Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved phenomenal success in various domains, but its lack of transparency hinders widespread adoption. This paper presents a novel approach to scalable explainability in DRL, dubbed 'HierExplain'. By integrating hierarchical attention networks with feature importance estimation, HierExplain provides real-time, fine-grained explanations for DRL agents' decisions. We demonstrate the efficacy of HierExplain on a variety of Atari games, showcasing improved explanation quality and reduced computational overhead compared to existing methods.
