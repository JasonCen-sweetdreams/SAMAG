Traditional hierarchical clustering algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to poor clustering quality and high computational costs. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepHClust', which integrates deep representation learning with hierarchical clustering to effectively handle high-dimensional data. We propose a neural network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of the data, which is then fed into a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Our approach not only improves clustering quality but also reduces computational complexity. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DeepHClust over state-of-the-art methods.
