Distributed databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management systems. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system performance metrics. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
