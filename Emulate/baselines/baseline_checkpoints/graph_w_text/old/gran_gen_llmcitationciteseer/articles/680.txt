Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve the daily lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing systems often fail to accommodate their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered design framework for accessible conversational interfaces, incorporating recommendations from a survey of caregivers and cognitive experts. We evaluate our approach through a usability study with 20 older adults, demonstrating improved comprehension and engagement compared to commercial conversational agents. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and supportive conversational systems for this vulnerable population.
