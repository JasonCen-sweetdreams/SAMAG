This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model for efficient document retrieval. Our approach leverages a two-stage ranking framework, where a coarse-grained relevance model is used to prune the document collection, followed by a fine-grained ranking model that refines the relevance scores. We introduce a novel training objective that combines both stages and enables end-to-end learning. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency.
