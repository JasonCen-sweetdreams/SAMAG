Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on handcrafted features and suffer from limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn robust query representations from large-scale text datasets. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively incorporates relevant context from the top-ranked documents, enabling more accurate expansion of the original query. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in terms of mean average precision and NDCG@20 compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
