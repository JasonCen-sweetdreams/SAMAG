Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it significantly affects the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel adaptive query expansion framework, 'AQE-DRL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to dynamically select the most relevant expansion terms. AQE-DRL integrates a neural network-based policy with a reward function that balances precision and recall. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AQE-DRL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing the computational overhead.
