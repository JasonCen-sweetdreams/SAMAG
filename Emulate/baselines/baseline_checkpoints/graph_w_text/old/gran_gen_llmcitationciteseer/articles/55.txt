Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. Our method, called QOpt, uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that adapts to changing workload patterns and system conditions. We evaluate QOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
