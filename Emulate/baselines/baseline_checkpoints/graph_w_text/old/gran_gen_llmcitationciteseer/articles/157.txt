As autonomous systems become increasingly integrated into daily life, it is essential to ensure that they are designed to be inclusive and accessible to diverse user populations. This paper presents a participatory design approach to human-robot collaboration, which involves users with disabilities in the design and development of autonomous systems. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with users with visual impairments, motor impairments, and cognitive impairments, and developed a framework for inclusive autonomous system design. Our findings highlight the importance of user-centered design principles, adaptive interfaces, and multimodal interaction mechanisms in creating autonomous systems that are accessible and usable by a wide range of users.
