We present a decentralized autonomous agent system for real-time resource allocation in dynamic environments. Our approach, called 'DARE', utilizes a multi-agent framework to optimize resource allocation in real-time, without relying on a central authority. Each agent is equipped with a reinforcement learning module that adaptively adjusts its decision-making strategy based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. We evaluate DARE in a simulated smart city scenario, demonstrating improved resource allocation efficiency and resilience compared to traditional centralized approaches.
