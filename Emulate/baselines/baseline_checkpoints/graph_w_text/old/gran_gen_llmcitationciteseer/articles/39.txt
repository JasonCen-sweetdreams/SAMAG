Distributed column stores have emerged as a popular choice for big data analytics, but efficient query processing remains a major challenge. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'DIMA', designed for scalable and efficient processing of multi-dimensional range queries on distributed column stores. DIMA leverages a hierarchical indexing structure and a cost-based optimization framework to minimize data transfer and maximize parallelism. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that DIMA outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time and scales to handle large datasets.
