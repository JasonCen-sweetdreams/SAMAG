This paper tackles the challenge of interpretable decision-making in multi-agent systems. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that learns to identify influential agents and interactions in complex scenarios. By incorporating attention mechanisms at both agent and interaction levels, HAN enables the identification of critical decision-making factors and improves overall system performance. Experimental results on a real-world autonomous vehicle dataset demonstrate the efficacy of HAN in reducing decision uncertainty and enhancing transparency in multi-agent decision-making processes.
