Ranking models are crucial in modern information retrieval systems, but their computational complexity hinders their deployment in large-scale applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HiNeuRank', which leverages the strengths of both neural networks and traditional indexing techniques. HiNeuRank uses a hierarchical architecture to prune irrelevant documents, reducing the number of neural network evaluations required. Experimental results on the TREC Deep Learning Track dataset demonstrate that HiNeuRank achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational costs by up to 75% compared to existing neural ranking models.
