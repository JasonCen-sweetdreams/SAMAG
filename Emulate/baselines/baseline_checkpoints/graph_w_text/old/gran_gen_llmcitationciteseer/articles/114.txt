Query optimization is a crucial step in database systems, as it directly impacts query performance. Traditional optimization techniques rely on hand-crafted heuristics, which may not generalize well to complex queries or dynamic workloads. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQopt', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed databases. We introduce a hierarchical state representation that captures query semantics, database statistics, and system resources. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset show that DeepQopt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 3x in query execution time, while adapting to changing workloads and database configurations.
