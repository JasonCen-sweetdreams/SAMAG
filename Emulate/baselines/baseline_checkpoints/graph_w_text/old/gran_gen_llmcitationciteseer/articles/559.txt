Distributed database systems face significant performance challenges due to network latency and data skew. This paper presents a novel adaptive caching framework, 'AdaCache', which dynamically adjusts cache sizes and eviction policies based on query patterns and system workload. We propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to optimize cache configuration, leveraging query execution metrics and system feedback. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that AdaCache improves query performance by up to 35% compared to traditional caching strategies, while reducing memory overhead by 20%.
