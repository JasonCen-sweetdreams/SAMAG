In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize task assignment and execution. Our approach, called DRL-TA, uses a novel combination of actor-critic methods and graph neural networks to learn effective task allocation policies that account for agent capabilities, task dependencies, and environmental uncertainties. Experimental results on a range of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and overall system performance.
