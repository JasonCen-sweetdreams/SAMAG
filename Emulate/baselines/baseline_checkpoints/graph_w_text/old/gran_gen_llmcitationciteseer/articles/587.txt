This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to enhance user experience and interaction. We designed a gesture-based interface that leverages the cognitive benefits of bodily engagement, allowing users to manipulate virtual objects with intuitive gestures. Our user study reveals that participants using the embodied interface showed improved memory recall, spatial awareness, and overall satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems and potential applications in fields such as education, training, and therapy.
