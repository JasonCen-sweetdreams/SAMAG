Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages graph-based embeddings to better model term relationships. We introduce a scalable, unsupervised method for constructing a term graph, which is used to generate contextualized embeddings for query terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves retrieval performance, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, by effectively capturing semantic and syntactic relationships between terms.
