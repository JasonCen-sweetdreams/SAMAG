Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the varying importance of modalities. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that learns to weigh and fuse modality-specific features effectively. Our HAN model incorporates a novel attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on salient regions in each modality, enabling explainable emotion recognition. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal inputs, while providing interpretable insights into the decision-making process.
