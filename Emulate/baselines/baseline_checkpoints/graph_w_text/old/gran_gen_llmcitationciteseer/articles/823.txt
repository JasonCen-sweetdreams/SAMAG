This paper explores the potential of multimodal feedback in improving the user experience for visually impaired individuals. We designed and developed an accessibility-centric interface that leverages a combination of audio, tactile, and haptic feedback to facilitate intuitive interaction. A user study involving 20 visually impaired participants revealed significant improvements in task completion rate, user satisfaction, and reduced cognitive load when compared to traditional screen reader-based interfaces. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multimodal feedback in designing accessible systems and provide insights for future research in this domain.
