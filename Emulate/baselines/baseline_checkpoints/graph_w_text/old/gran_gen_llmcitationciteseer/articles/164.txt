This paper presents a novel hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for autonomous traffic signal control. Our approach, called HMAS, consists of a hierarchical structure of agents that learn to optimize traffic signal timings in real-time. The high-level agent learns to coordinate with neighboring intersections, while the low-level agent adjusts signal timings based on local traffic conditions. We evaluate HMAS on a realistic traffic simulator and demonstrate significant reductions in traffic congestion and travel time compared to traditional fixed-time signal control methods.
