Traditional information retrieval systems rely on hand-crafted features and ranking models, which can be suboptimal for complex queries. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'DeepRank', which learns to filter and rank documents based on semantic relevance. We leverage a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query-document similarity and relevance labeling. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that DeepRank outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
