Multi-agent pathfinding is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence, with applications in robotics, video games, and traffic simulation. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages deep graph neural networks (GNNs) to efficiently solve this problem. Our method, called GraphPath, represents the environment as a graph and learns to predict optimal paths for multiple agents using a hierarchical GNN architecture. We show that GraphPath outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality and computation time, making it suitable for real-time applications. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
