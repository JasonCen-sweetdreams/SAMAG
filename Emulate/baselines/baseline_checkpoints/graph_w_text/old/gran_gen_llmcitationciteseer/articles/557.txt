Time series forecasting has numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and climate science, but existing models often lack interpretability. We propose a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both temporal and spatial attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant input features and time steps. Our approach yields improved forecasting accuracy and provides visual explanations of the model's decision-making process. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in capturing complex patterns and relationships, while facilitating model interpretability and trustworthiness.
