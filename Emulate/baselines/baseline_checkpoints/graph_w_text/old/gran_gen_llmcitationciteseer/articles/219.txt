Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but current systems lack emotional intelligence. This paper presents 'EmoVR', a novel framework that integrates real-time facial emotion recognition (FER) into VR environments. EmoVR leverages a lightweight, convolutional neural network (CNN) for FER, achieving high accuracy (>95%) and low latency (<100ms) on a diverse dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoVR in enhancing user engagement and emotional experience in VR-based social skills training and entertainment applications.
