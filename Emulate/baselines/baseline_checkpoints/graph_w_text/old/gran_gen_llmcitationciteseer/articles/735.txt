Real-time data warehousing requires efficient query optimization to support timely decision-making. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', that leverages column store indexing to accelerate query execution. We propose a cost-based optimization model that considers column store statistics, query patterns, and data distribution to select the most efficient execution plan. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that ColOpt outperforms traditional row-store based query optimization by up to 30% in terms of query response time, while maintaining comparable accuracy.
