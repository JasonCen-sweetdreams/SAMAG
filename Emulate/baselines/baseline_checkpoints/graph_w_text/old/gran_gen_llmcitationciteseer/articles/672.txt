Query optimization is a critical component of database systems, but traditional approaches often struggle to efficiently explore the vast space of possible query plans. This paper presents a novel framework, 'DeepQO', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed databases. By representing query plans as Markov decision processes, we train an actor-critic network to learn an optimal query optimization policy. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that DeepQO achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimizers, particularly for complex queries involving joins and subqueries.
