Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexities of human emotions and the variability of modalities. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features at multiple scales. Our HAN architecture consists of modality-specific attention modules and a hierarchical fusion mechanism, enabling the model to capture both local and global patterns in the input data. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 7.2% across different emotion categories.
