Traditional latent semantic analysis (LSA) suffers from high computational complexity and limited query specificity. This paper presents a novel, query-aware LSA approach, 'QLSA', which leverages term importance and document relevance to efficiently filter out irrelevant documents. By introducing a query-dependent matrix factorization, QLSA reduces the dimensionality of the term-document matrix while preserving query-specific semantics. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that QLSA outperforms state-of-the-art LSA methods in terms of precision, recall, and computational efficiency.
