Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but users with dysarthria, a speech disorder characterized by impaired articulation, often struggle to interact with these systems. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an inclusive voice assistant, 'EasySpeak', tailored to the needs of individuals with dysarthria. We employed participatory design methods, involving users with dysarthria in the development process, to create a system that adapts to their unique speech patterns. EasySpeak incorporates advanced speech recognition algorithms, personalized error correction, and intuitive feedback mechanisms. Our user study reveals significant improvements in interaction success rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
