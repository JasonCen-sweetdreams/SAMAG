Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but they still struggle to effectively integrate query expansion techniques. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion, PRF-Net, which leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to adaptively select Expansion terms. PRF-Net employs a neural network to predict the relevance of candidate terms based on their semantic similarity to the original query and the top-ranked documents. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that PRF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in retrieval effectiveness.
