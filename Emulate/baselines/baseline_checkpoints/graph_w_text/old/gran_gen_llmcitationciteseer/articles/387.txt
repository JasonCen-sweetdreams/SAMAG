Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it helps to mitigate the vocabulary mismatch problem. This paper proposes a novel QE approach that leverages deep neural networks to capture semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Our method, dubbed 'QNLP', incorporates a pre-trained language model fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data, which enables it to learn context-aware representations of words and phrases. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QNLP outperforms traditional QE techniques, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
