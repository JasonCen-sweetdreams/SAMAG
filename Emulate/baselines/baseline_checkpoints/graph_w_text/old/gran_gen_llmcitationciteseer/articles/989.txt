Cooperative multi-agent systems require efficient task allocation to achieve collective goals. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task assignments. We represent the agent-task interactions as a graph and employ a GNN to learn node representations that capture the complex relationships between agents and tasks. The proposed framework iteratively allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, task requirements, and learned node representations. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional task allocation methods, achieving higher task completion rates and reduced communication overhead.
