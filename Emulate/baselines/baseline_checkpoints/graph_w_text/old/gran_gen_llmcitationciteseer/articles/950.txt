Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interactions are often criticized for lacking empathy and understanding. This paper investigates the impact of personality traits and conversational styles on user experience and perceptions of voice assistants. We conducted a mixed-methods study, combining surveys, interviews, and usability testing, to explore how different personality traits (e.g., extraversion, agreeableness) and conversational styles (e.g., formal, informal) influence user satisfaction and trust. Our findings suggest that incorporating personality-driven conversational styles can improve user experience, particularly for users with disabilities. We propose a framework for designing inclusive voice assistants that adapt to individual differences in personality and communication preferences.
