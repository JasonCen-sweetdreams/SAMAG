This paper investigates distributed opinion dynamics in open multi-agent systems, where agents can join or leave the system dynamically. We propose a novel opinion update rule that incorporates both local and global interactions, and analyze its convergence properties using graph theory and stochastic processes. Our approach enables agents to reach a consensus even in the presence of stubborn agents or biased information sources. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various scenarios, including social networks and online forums.
