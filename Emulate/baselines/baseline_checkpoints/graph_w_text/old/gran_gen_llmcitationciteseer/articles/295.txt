In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). Our method, called D-Task, leverages local constraint solving and iterative message passing to find near-optimal task assignments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of D-Task in simulations of autonomous vehicle coordination and disaster response scenarios, showcasing its scalability and robustness in the presence of agent failures and communication disruptions.
