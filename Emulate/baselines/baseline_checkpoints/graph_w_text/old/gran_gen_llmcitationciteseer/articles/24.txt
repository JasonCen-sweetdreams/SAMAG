Distributed database systems (DDS) play a crucial role in modern data processing, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query plans in DDS. We propose a novel RL framework, 'DQO', which leverages a combination of graph neural networks and deep Q-networks to learn query optimization strategies. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DQO outperforms traditional query optimizers, achieving an average reduction of 35% in query execution time and 25% in resource utilization.
