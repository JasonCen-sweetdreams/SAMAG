Real-time object detection is a crucial task in various computer vision applications, including autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention mechanism integrated with YOLOv5, dubbed HA-YOLOv5, to improve object detection efficiency and accuracy. Our approach leverages attention weights to selectively focus on relevant regions and features, reducing computational overhead while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. We evaluate HA-YOLOv5 on the COCO dataset, demonstrating a 25% reduction in inference time and a 2.5% increase in mAP compared to the baseline YOLOv5 model.
