This study investigates the design of voice-based interfaces for older adults, focusing on conversational flow and error recovery. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65-85, using a custom-built voice assistant to complete tasks. Our results show that older adults prefer a more structured conversation flow, with explicit confirmation and feedback mechanisms. We also identify common error patterns and propose a set of design guidelines for voice-based interfaces that can mitigate these errors and improve overall user experience. Our findings have implications for the development of accessible and user-friendly voice-based interfaces for older adults.
