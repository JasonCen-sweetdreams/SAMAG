Main-memory databases have become increasingly popular due to their ability to provide high-performance query execution. However, efficient indexing techniques for column-oriented storage in these systems remain an open challenge. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, called 'ColIndex', which leverages the characteristics of column-oriented storage to reduce index creation time and improve query performance. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that ColIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of index creation time and up to 2x in terms of query execution time.
