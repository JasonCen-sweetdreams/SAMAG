Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed graph databases. We introduce a deep Q-network that learns to select the most efficient query plan based on the graph structure, query patterns, and system workload. Our experiments on a large-scale graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
