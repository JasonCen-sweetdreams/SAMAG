Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for business intelligence and decision-making. However, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck in achieving timely responses. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'QuickOpt', that leverages machine learning to optimize query execution plans for real-time data warehouses. We develop a neural network-based model to predict query execution times and identify the most efficient plans. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that QuickOpt reduces query latency by up to 50% compared to traditional optimization techniques, while maintaining high accuracy and scalability.
