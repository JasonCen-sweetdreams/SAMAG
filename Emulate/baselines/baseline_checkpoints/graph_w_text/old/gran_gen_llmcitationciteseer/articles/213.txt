Time-series data is increasingly prevalent in various domains, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, traditional relational databases struggle to efficiently process and analyze large-scale time-series data. This paper presents COMET, a column-oriented main memory database engine optimized for time-series analytics. COMET leverages a novel compression scheme, adaptive chunking, and a parallel query execution framework to achieve significant performance improvements over existing solutions. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that COMET outperforms state-of-the-art systems by up to 5x in query response time and 3x in data ingestion rate.
