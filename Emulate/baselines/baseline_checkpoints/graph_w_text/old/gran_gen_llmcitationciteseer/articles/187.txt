Conversational interfaces, such as chatbots and voice assistants, have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of people with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces, focusing on accessibility and usability for individuals with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with participants with disabilities, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of guidelines and a prototype interface that incorporates multimodal input, adaptive feedback, and personalized support. The results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction for participants with disabilities.
