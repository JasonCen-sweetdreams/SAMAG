In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel approach to distributed task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, called 'AgentDQN', leverages a decentralized architecture where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. We demonstrate that AgentDQN outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate, response time, and adaptability to changing environments. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario show that AgentDQN can effectively coordinate a team of agents to achieve complex tasks.
