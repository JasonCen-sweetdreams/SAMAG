Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is a challenging task, particularly in applications such as IoT sensor monitoring and financial forecasting. This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework, 'TS-Anomaly', which combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn patterns and anomalies in high-dimensional time series data. Our approach leverages the strengths of both CNNs and RNNs, enabling robust detection of anomalies in complex, high-dimensional data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TS-Anomaly, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
