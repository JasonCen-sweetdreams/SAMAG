Distributed database systems are crucial for modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing complex queries remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, called 'QOpt', uses a graph neural network to learn a query plan representation and predict optimal join orders. We evaluate QOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques. Our approach is scalable, adaptive, and can be easily integrated into existing database management systems.
