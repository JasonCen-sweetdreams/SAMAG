In complex multi-agent systems, cooperative task allocation is crucial for achieving efficient and scalable performance. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'Coop-TARL', which enables agents to learn cooperative task allocation strategies in decentralized environments. Our approach leverages graph attention networks to model agent interactions and incorporates a novel reward function that encourages cooperation and fairness. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that Coop-TARL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and agent satisfaction.
