Individuals with motor impairments often face significant barriers when interacting with virtual reality (VR) systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of gaze-based interaction as a potential solution. We designed a custom VR environment and conducted a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments, comparing gaze-based interaction with traditional controller-based interaction. Our results show that gaze-based interaction significantly improves user experience, reducing error rates and increasing task completion times. We also identify key challenges and opportunities for future research in this area, highlighting the need for more inclusive VR design.
