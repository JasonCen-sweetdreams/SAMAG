Effective negotiation is a crucial aspect of multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents interact and make decisions to achieve their goals. This paper proposes a novel approach to designing adaptive negotiation strategies for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a framework that incorporates a deep Q-network to learn negotiation strategies from interactions with other agents. The framework is evaluated in a simulated negotiation environment, where agents negotiate over resources and tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional negotiation strategies, achieving higher negotiation success rates and improved resource allocation.
