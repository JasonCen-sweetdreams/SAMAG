Time series forecasting has seen significant advancements with the adoption of deep learning models. However, the lack of interpretability in these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to generate explainable forecasts. We demonstrate the efficacy of HAN on several benchmark datasets, showcasing improved performance and feature importance interpretability. The proposed model provides insights into the temporal relationships and feature contributions, enabling more informed decision-making in domains like finance and healthcare.
