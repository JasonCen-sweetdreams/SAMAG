Knowledge graphs have become a crucial component in various applications, but entity disambiguation remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel graph-based embedding approach, 'GraphED', which leverages both local and global structural information to disambiguate entities in large-scale knowledge graphs. GraphED utilizes a hierarchical graph attention mechanism to learn dense representations of entities and their relationships, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphED in improving knowledge graph completion and question answering tasks.
