Real-time traffic prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in modeling complex traffic patterns, but their computational overhead hinders large-scale deployment. We propose 'TrafficGNN+', a scalable GNN architecture that leverages graph sampling and parallelization techniques to reduce computation time while maintaining prediction accuracy. Our approach is evaluated on a large-scale traffic dataset, demonstrating a 5x speedup over state-of-the-art GNN models while achieving comparable prediction performance.
