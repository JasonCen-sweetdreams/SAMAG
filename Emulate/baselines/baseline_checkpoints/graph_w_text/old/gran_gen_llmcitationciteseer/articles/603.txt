In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach, called GTA-GNN, leverages the expressive power of GNNs to learn a distributed task allocation policy that adapts to the dynamic topology of the agent network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA-GNN in a variety of simulated scenarios, showcasing its ability to efficiently allocate tasks to agents with diverse capabilities while minimizing communication overhead. Our results show that GTA-GNN outperforms traditional decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion time and overall system performance.
