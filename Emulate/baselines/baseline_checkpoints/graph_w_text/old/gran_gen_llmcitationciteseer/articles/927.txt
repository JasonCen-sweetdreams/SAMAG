Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has emerged as a crucial technique for AI applications, but existing methods struggle to capture complex relationships and scale to large graphs. We propose 'HierAtt', a novel KGE framework that leverages adaptive hierarchical attention to selectively focus on relevant entities and relations. Our approach dynamically adjusts the attention weights based on the graph structure and entity types, leading to improved performance and reduced computational cost. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate HierAtt's superiority over state-of-the-art KGE methods in terms of link prediction, entity classification, and scalability.
