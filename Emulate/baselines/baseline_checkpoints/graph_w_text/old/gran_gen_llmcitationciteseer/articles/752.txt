Multi-label node classification is a crucial task in graph-structured data analysis, where each node can belong to multiple classes. Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) often suffer from limited attention span and inadequate label correlation modeling. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) framework, which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and labels. Our approach also incorporates a label correlation module to capture complex relationships between labels. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both macro-F1 score and label-wise accuracy.
