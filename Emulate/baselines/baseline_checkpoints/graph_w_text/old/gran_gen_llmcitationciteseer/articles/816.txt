Time-series data has become ubiquitous in many applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, traditional clustering methods struggle to handle large-scale time-series data due to their high dimensionality and noise. This paper proposes a novel graph-based self-organizing map (SOM) approach for efficient hierarchical clustering of time-series data. Our method leverages the strengths of both graph theory and SOMs to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art clustering algorithms in terms of clustering quality, computational efficiency, and scalability.
