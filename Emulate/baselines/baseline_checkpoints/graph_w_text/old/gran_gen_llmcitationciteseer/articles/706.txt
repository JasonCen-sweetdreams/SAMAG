This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to coordinate autonomous vehicles in complex urban scenarios. Our approach, called Distributed Autonomous Vehicle Coordination (DAVC), enables vehicles to learn cooperative policies in real-time, adapting to changing traffic conditions and pedestrian behavior. DAVC leverages a novel communication protocol to facilitate information exchange among vehicles, ensuring scalable and efficient coordination. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in traffic flow, safety, and passenger satisfaction compared to traditional centralized optimization methods.
