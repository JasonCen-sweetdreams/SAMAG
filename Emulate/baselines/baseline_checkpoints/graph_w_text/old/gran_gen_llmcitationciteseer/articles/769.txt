Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significance in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture for ERS, which models complex relationships between users, items, and attributes. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture hierarchical dependencies and generates personalized explanations for recommendations. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
