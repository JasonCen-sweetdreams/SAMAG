Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have gained popularity in recent years, but optimizing query performance for multiple tenants remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'OptiTenant', which leverages machine learning-based workload characterization and dynamic resource allocation to minimize query latency and improve overall system throughput. We evaluate OptiTenant using a real-world DBaaS platform and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing optimization techniques.
