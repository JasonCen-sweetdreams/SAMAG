Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents for answer extraction. This paper introduces a novel approach to passage retrieval using hierarchical sentence embeddings. We propose a multi-granularity sentence representation that captures both local and global contextual information. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dense retrieval models in terms of retrieval efficiency and accuracy, while achieving comparable answer extraction performance.
