In multi-agent systems, negotiation is a crucial aspect of achieving mutual goals. However, existing negotiation strategies often assume a static environment, neglecting the dynamic nature of real-world scenarios. This paper proposes an adaptive negotiation framework, 'DyAN', which leverages reinforcement learning to adjust negotiation strategies in response to changing environmental conditions. We evaluate DyAN in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved coordination and resource allocation compared to traditional negotiation methods. Our approach has significant implications for the development of more effective and resilient multi-agent systems.
