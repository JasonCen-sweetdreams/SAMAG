Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called GraphQOpt, learns to select efficient query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. We evaluate GraphQOpt on a real-world graph dataset and show that it outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
