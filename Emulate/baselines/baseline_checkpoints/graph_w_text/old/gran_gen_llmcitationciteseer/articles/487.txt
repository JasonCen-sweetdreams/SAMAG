Fake news has become a pervasive problem in online social networks, with severe consequences for individuals and society. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) for fake news detection. HAGNN integrates graph neural networks with hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between news articles, users, and their engagement patterns. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving an F1-score of 0.92 on the FakeNewsNet dataset. We also conduct an in-depth analysis of the learned attention weights, providing insights into the importance of different user groups and news features in fake news detection.
