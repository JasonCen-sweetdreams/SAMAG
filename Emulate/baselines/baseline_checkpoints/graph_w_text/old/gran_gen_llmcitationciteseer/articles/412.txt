This paper proposes a novel approach to distributed task allocation for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized Markov decision process and train a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Our approach, called 'Decentralized Task Allocation Network' (DTAN), can handle complex task dependencies and agent capabilities, and is shown to outperform traditional heuristic-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization. We evaluate DTAN on a simulated warehouse management scenario and demonstrate its scalability and robustness to changes in the environment.
