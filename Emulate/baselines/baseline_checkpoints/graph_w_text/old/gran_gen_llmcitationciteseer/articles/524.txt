Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., text, audio, video) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the heterogeneity of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of each modality to recognize emotions. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers that learn to weigh the importance of each modality, followed by a hierarchical fusion layer that combines the modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition. Furthermore, we provide a visual explanation of the attention weights, enabling the interpretation of the model's decision-making process.
