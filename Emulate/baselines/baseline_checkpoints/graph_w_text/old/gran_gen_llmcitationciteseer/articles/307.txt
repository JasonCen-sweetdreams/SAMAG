Voice assistants have transformed the way we interact with technology, but their benefits are often inaccessible to older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an accessible voice assistant tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving surveys, interviews, and usability testing to identify the challenges and requirements of our target users. Our proposed system incorporates a range of accommodations, including natural language understanding, error tolerance, and personalized feedback. Evaluation results show significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction, indicating the potential for voice assistants to promote digital inclusion among older adults with cognitive impairments.
