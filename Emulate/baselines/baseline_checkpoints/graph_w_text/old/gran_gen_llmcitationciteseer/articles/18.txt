In multi-agent systems, conflicts arise when agents pursue competing goals or share limited resources. Deconfliction strategies aim to mitigate these conflicts, but existing approaches often rely on complete information about agent goals, capabilities, and preferences. This paper addresses the more realistic scenario where agents have incomplete information about each other. We propose a novel framework that combines Bayesian inference with graph-based reasoning to identify potential conflicts and negotiate resolutions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various domains, including autonomous vehicles and smart grid management.
