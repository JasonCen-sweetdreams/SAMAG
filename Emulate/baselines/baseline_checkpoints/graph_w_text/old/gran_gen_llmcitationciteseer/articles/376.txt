Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, requiring models to adapt to new classes with limited data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical meta-learning approach, 'HMLE', that leverages both task-level and episode-level meta-learning to improve few-shot classification accuracy. HMLE consists of a task encoder that learns to encode task-specific information and an episode encoder that adapts to new episodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HMLE on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in few-shot image classification tasks.
