Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual impairments. We conducted a user study to identify the challenges faced by visually impaired users in VR and developed a set of guidelines for designers. Our proposed framework incorporates audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized assistance to enable visually impaired users to fully engage with VR environments. We evaluated our framework through a usability study and found significant improvements in user experience and accessibility.
