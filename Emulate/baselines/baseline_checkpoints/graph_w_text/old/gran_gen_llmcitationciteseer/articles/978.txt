In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to distribute tasks among agents in a decentralized manner. Our method, called 'AgentRL', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal task allocation policy based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and environmental constraints. We evaluate AgentRL in a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation strategies.
