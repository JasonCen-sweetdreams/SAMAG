This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in virtual reality (VR)-based learning environments. We designed and implemented a VR platform that allows users to create personalized avatars and interact with virtual learning objects. A user study with 120 participants revealed that users who created personalized avatars showed higher levels of engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes compared to those using generic avatars. Our results suggest that personalized avatars can enhance the sense of presence and identity in VR-based learning, leading to improved learning experiences.
