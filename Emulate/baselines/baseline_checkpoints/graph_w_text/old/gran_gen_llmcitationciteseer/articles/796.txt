Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in information retrieval (IR). This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to capture semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weights query terms and their expansions based on document relevance. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
