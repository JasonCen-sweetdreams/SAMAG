Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience and motivation in VR learning environments. We designed and implemented a VR platform that generates customized avatars based on users' preferences and personality traits. Our user study involving 120 participants shows that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, improved knowledge retention, and higher overall satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR learning systems.
