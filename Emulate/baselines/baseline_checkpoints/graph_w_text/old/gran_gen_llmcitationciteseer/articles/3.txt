Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often struggle with social interactions and communication. This paper presents a co-design methodology for creating tangible and virtual interfaces that facilitate social skills development in children with ASD. We collaborated with 15 children with ASD, their caregivers, and clinicians to design and evaluate a series of interactive systems that combine physical blocks with virtual agents. Our results show that the co-designed interfaces improved social engagement, eye contact, and verbal communication in children with ASD. We contribute a set of design principles for inclusive and accessible HCI systems that can be used to support social skills development in this population.
