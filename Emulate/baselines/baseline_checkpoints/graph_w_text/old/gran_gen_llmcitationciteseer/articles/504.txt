Passage retrieval is a crucial component in many information retrieval systems, where the goal is to retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus. In this paper, we propose a novel neural re-ranking approach to improve the effectiveness of query expansion techniques. Our method, called NeuQE, leverages a deep neural network to re-rank candidate passages generated by traditional query expansion methods. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision.
