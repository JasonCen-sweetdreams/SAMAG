Gesture recognition systems have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but individuals with motor impairments often struggle to interact with these systems. This paper presents a novel adaptive gesture recognition framework, 'EasyGesture', which leverages machine learning to personalize gesture recognition models for individuals with motor impairments. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group users based on their motor abilities, and a transfer learning technique to adapt the gesture recognition model to each user's unique abilities. Experimental results show that EasyGesture outperforms existing gesture recognition systems in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction for individuals with motor impairments.
