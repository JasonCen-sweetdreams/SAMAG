Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and behavior in VR environments. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment involving 120 participants, who interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a social VR scenario. Our results show that users with personalized avatars reported higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and self-identification, and exhibited more social behavior. We discuss the implications for VR system design and provide guidelines for creating effective personalized avatars.
