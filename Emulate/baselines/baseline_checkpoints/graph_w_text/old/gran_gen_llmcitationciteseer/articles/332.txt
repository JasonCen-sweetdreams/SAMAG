Main-memory database systems (MMDBs) have become increasingly popular due to their high performance and low latency. However, achieving high concurrency and fault tolerance in MMDBs remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) protocol, called 'MVCC-TX', which efficiently supports transactional operations in MMDBs. MVCC-TX leverages a combination of timestamp ordering and validation to minimize conflicts and reduce the overhead of transactional execution. Our evaluation on a real-world MMDB system shows that MVCC-TX outperforms existing MVCC protocols by up to 30% in terms of transaction throughput and latency.
