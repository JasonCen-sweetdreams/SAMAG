Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and behavior in VR environments. We designed an experiment with 120 participants, who interacted with a VR game using either a generic or personalized avatar. Results show that users with personalized avatars exhibit increased engagement, satisfaction, and immersion, as measured through physiological and behavioral metrics. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems and highlight opportunities for further research.
