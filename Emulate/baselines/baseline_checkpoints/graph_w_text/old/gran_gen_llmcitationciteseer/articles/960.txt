This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and resource constraints must coordinate to achieve a common goal. We formulate the problem as a distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) problem and propose a decentralized algorithm, CODA, which leverages local search and negotiation to find near-optimal task assignments. CODA is shown to outperform existing methods in terms of solution quality and convergence speed, and is robust to changes in agent availability and task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of CODA in coordinating task allocation among heterogeneous agents.
