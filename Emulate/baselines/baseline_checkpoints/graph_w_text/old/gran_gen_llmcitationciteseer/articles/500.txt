Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc search systems, aiming to improve retrieval effectiveness by adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper presents a novel QE approach that leverages neural re-ranking to select the most informative expansion terms. Our method, dubbed 'NeuQE', first generates a set of candidate expansion terms using a language model, and then employs a neural re-ranker to predict the relevance of each term to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance.
