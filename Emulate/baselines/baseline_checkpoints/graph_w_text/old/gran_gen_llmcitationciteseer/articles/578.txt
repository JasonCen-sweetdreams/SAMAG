Fake news detection has become a pressing concern in today's digital age. While state-of-the-art models have achieved high accuracy, they often lack transparency and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) framework for explainable fake news detection. HGAN leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between news articles, users, and entities, while hierarchical pooling enables the extraction of relevant features at multiple scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN on a large-scale fake news dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in F1-score over existing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we provide visualizations of the attention weights to shed light on the decision-making process, thereby enhancing model explainability.
