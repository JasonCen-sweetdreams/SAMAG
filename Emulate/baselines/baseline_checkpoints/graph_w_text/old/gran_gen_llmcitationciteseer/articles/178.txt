Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity and neglect the hierarchical structure of real-world graphs. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs at different scales. HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while reducing computational overhead by up to 50%. We also provide theoretical insights into the expressive power of HGAT and its connections to graph spectral theory.
