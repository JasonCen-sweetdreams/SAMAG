Explainable AI-powered recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that integrates both item-level and user-level graph attention mechanisms to provide personalized recommendations. HGAT leverages a hierarchical graph structure to capture complex relationships between items and users, and incorporates an attention-based explainability module to provide insights into the recommendation process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and providing meaningful explanations.
