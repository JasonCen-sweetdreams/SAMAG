Autonomous warehouse management involves coordinating multiple robots to efficiently accomplish various tasks. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments and robot routes. Our approach, called 'MATAR', incorporates a decentralized actor-critic architecture that allows agents to learn from their own experiences and those of their peers. We evaluate MATAR in a simulated warehouse environment and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion times and robot utilization compared to traditional heuristic-based methods.
