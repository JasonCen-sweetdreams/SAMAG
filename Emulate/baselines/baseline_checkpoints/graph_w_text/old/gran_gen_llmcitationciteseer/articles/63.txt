The rapid growth of big data has led to a surge in demand for efficient query optimization techniques. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages column-oriented storage to improve query performance. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that exploits the characteristics of column stores to minimize I/O and CPU overhead. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that ColOpt outperforms traditional row-oriented storage by up to 5x in query execution time, making it an attractive solution for big data analytics.
