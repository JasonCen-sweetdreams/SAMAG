Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing queries in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed environments. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select optimal query plans based on the system's current state and workload. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query latency and resource utilization. We also explore the applicability of our approach to various DDS architectures and workloads.
