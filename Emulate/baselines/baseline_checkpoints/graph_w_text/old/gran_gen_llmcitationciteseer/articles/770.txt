Accurate diagnosis of complex diseases often relies on integrating multiple sources of medical data, including clinical notes, lab results, and medical images. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that learns to selectively focus on relevant features and relationships across different modalities. Our approach leverages a graph-based representation of medical data, enabling the model to capture non-linear interactions between variables. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, achieving a 12% increase in F1-score compared to the best baseline.
