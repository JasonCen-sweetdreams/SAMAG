Real-time analytics in distributed column-store databases is crucial for various applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed query processing and the need for low-latency responses. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'RTOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and a dynamic query reordering strategy to minimize query latency. Our evaluation on a real-world distributed database setup demonstrates that RTOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time, while maintaining high accuracy and scalability.
