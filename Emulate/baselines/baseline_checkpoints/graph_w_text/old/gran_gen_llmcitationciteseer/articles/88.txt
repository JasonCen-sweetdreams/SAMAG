This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to enhance user experience. We designed a gesture-based interaction system that leverages users' bodily movements to manipulate virtual objects. Our user study involving 30 participants shows that the embodied interaction approach significantly improves task performance, reduces cognitive load, and enhances overall user satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more intuitive and engaging VR interfaces.
