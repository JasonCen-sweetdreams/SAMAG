Edge computing has transformed the way we process data in IoT networks, but resource allocation remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a decentralized agent-based system, 'EdgeAgent', which enables autonomous decision-making for resource allocation in edge computing environments. Our approach leverages multi-agent systems to model the interactions between edge devices, users, and applications, and introduces a novel negotiation protocol to optimize resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeAgent reduces latency by up to 30% and improves resource utilization by up to 25% compared to traditional centralized approaches.
