Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex network data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', designed for distributed graph databases. GraphOpt leverages a combination of statistical graph summarization and distributed query planning to reduce the number of redundant subqueries and minimize communication overhead. Our experiments on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt achieves up to 3x performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
