This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in multi-agent systems, where a set of agents with diverse capabilities need to be assigned to a set of tasks with varying requirements. We propose a decentralized auction-based mechanism, where agents bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. Our approach ensures that the task allocation is efficient, scalable, and resilient to agent failures. We evaluate our mechanism through extensive simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness in various scenarios, including those with dynamic task arrivals and departures.
