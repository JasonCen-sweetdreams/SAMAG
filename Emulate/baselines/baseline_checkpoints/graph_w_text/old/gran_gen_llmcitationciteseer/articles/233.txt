Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution plans in such systems remains a complex task, especially when dealing with dynamic workloads and varying system conditions. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to adaptively select optimal execution plans based on feedback from the system. We evaluate our approach on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
