Graph pattern matching is a fundamental problem in graph databases, with applications in social network analysis, bioinformatics, and recommender systems. However, existing solutions suffer from scalability limitations, particularly when dealing with large graphs and complex patterns. This paper presents 'GPU-SubIso', a novel framework that leverages Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate subgraph isomorphism testing, a key component of graph pattern matching. We propose a parallelized algorithm that exploits the massive parallelism of modern GPUs, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art CPU-based solutions. Experimental results on real-world graphs demonstrate that GPU-SubIso can handle graphs with millions of vertices and edges, while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency.
