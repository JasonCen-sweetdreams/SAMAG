Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their potential benefits are often inaccessible to older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant, 'EASE', tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our design incorporates simplification strategies, error tolerance, and multimodal feedback to facilitate interaction. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
