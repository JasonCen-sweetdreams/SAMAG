Traditional ranking models for document retrieval rely on hand-crafted features and suffer from limited scalability. We propose a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HierRank, which leverages deep learning to learn robust document representations. HierRank combines a document encoder with a hierarchical ranking module, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant documents. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency.
