Column-oriented data warehouses have become increasingly popular for analytical workloads, but query optimization remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query execution plans. We introduce a hybrid model that combines a graph neural network with a genetic algorithm to efficiently explore the query optimization search space. Experimental results on a real-world data warehouse show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x on complex queries.
