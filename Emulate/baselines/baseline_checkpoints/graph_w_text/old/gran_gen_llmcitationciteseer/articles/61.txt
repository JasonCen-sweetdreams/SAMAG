Traffic congestion control is a complex problem that requires real-time decision-making to minimize delays and optimize traffic flow. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'TrafficCtrl', which leverages a combination of graph neural networks and Q-learning to optimize traffic signal control policies. We demonstrate the efficacy of TrafficCtrl on a large-scale traffic simulation platform, showing significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional signal control methods. Furthermore, we explore the transferability of our approach to real-world traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for deployment in smart cities.
