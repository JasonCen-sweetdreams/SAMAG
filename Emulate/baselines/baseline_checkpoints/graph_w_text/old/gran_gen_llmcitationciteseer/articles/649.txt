Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents an exploratory study on the speech patterns and error recovery strategies of older adults interacting with voice assistants. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+, analyzing their speech inputs, error rates, and recovery behaviors. Our findings highlight the importance of accommodating age-related speech changes, such as slower speech rates and increased hesitations, and developing more effective error recovery mechanisms. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants, including adaptive speech recognition and empathetic error messaging.
