Emotion recognition is a crucial aspect of human-computer interaction, and multimodal approaches have shown promise in improving recognition accuracy. However, existing visualization techniques often fail to effectively convey complex emotional states. This paper proposes a novel adaptive visualization framework, 'EmoVis', which dynamically adjusts the visual representation of multimodal emotional data based on user preferences and task requirements. Our user study demonstrates that EmoVis significantly improves user understanding and recognition of emotional states, particularly for subtle and nuanced emotions. We also explore the implications of EmoVis for affective computing and embodied cognition.
