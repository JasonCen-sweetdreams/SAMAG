In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective assignment strategies. We model the agent-task interactions as a graph and use GNNs to learn a distributed task allocation policy. Our approach allows agents to make local decisions based on their neighborhood information, reducing communication overhead and improving overall system performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional centralized approaches in complex task allocation scenarios.
