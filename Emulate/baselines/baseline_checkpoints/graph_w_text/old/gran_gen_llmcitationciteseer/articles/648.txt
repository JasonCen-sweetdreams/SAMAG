Distributed database systems pose significant challenges in query optimization, where the goal is to find an efficient execution plan that minimizes response time and resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that adapts to the dynamic environment of the distributed system. We evaluate RL-QOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance compared to traditional optimization techniques.
