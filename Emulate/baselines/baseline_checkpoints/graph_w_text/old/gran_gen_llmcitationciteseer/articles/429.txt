Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed graph databases. Our method, called QOptRL, uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy for selecting optimal join orders and data shipment strategies. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that QOptRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
