In complex, dynamic environments, autonomous agents must negotiate with each other to achieve their goals. This paper proposes a novel negotiation strategy, 'AdapNeg', which adapts to changing environment conditions and agent preferences. AdapNeg combines a cognitive reasoning framework with machine learning-based opponent modeling to optimize negotiation outcomes. Experimental results in a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate that AdapNeg outperforms existing negotiation strategies in terms of Pareto optimality, negotiation speed, and robustness to environment changes.
