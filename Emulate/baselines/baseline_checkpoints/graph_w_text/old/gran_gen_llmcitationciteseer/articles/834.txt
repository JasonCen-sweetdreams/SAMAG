Individuals with speech disabilities often face significant barriers when interacting with voice-based interfaces. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an inclusive voice-based interface, 'EasyVoice', which incorporates novel speech recognition and synthesis techniques to improve accessibility. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with speech disabilities, demonstrating that EasyVoice significantly outperforms commercial voice assistants in terms of recognition accuracy and user satisfaction. Our findings inform the development of more accessible voice-based interfaces that can empower individuals with speech disabilities to interact more effectively with digital systems.
