Distributed database systems pose significant challenges in query optimization due to the exponential growth of possible execution plans. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based approach to optimize query plans in distributed settings. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan by interacting with the database system and receiving feedback in the form of execution times. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution times compared to traditional optimization techniques.
