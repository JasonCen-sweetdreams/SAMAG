Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing systems often neglect their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for this population. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers, identifying key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a VR system that incorporates cognitive support, simplified interactions, and personalized content. A pilot study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in VR development.
