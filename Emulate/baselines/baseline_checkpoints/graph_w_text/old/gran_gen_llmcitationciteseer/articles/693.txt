Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval to improve the retrieval performance. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and heuristic-based term selection, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. We introduce a novel attention-based term selection mechanism that adaptively weights the importance of each term in the query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that NeuroQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
