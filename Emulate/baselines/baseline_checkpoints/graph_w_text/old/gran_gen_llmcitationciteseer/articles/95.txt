This paper addresses the task allocation problem in decentralized multi-agent systems, where agents need to cooperate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn decentralized task allocation policies. Our method, called DRL-TA, uses a multi-agent Q-network to learn the optimal task allocation strategy in a distributed manner. We evaluate DRL-TA in a simulated environment and show that it outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized approaches in terms of task completion time and agent utility. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of DRL-TA in the presence of agent failures and communication losses.
