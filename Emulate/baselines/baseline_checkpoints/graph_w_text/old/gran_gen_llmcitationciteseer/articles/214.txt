Recommender systems often rely on graph-based models to capture complex user-item relationships. However, existing approaches are prone to over-smoothing and vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture, which recursively applies attention mechanisms at multiple scales to learn robust and hierarchical representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of HGAN on several benchmark datasets, showcasing improved resistance to attacks and superior recommendation performance compared to state-of-the-art models.
