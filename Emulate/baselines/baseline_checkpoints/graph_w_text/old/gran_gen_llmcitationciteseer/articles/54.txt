Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory study involving 20 older adults to co-design an accessible conversational interface. We employed a mixed-methods approach, combining interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify key design requirements. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise language, simple navigation, and adaptive feedback mechanisms. We propose a set of design guidelines and a prototype system, 'ElderChat', which incorporates these requirements to facilitate more effective and engaging interactions for older adults.
