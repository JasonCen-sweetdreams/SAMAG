Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in node classification tasks. However, their performance degrades significantly in few-shot settings where only a limited number of labeled nodes are available. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, 'HAGNet', which leverages both node and graph-level attention mechanisms to adaptively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in few-shot node classification, outperforming existing GNN-based methods by a significant margin.
