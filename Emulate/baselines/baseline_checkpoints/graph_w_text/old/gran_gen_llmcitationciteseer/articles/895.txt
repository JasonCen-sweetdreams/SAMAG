This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems using hierarchical reinforcement learning. We propose a two-level hierarchical framework, where high-level agents learn to allocate tasks to low-level agents based on their capabilities and availability. The low-level agents, in turn, learn to execute tasks using reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach in a simulated environment with varying task complexities and agent capabilities, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system efficiency compared to traditional decentralized allocation methods.
