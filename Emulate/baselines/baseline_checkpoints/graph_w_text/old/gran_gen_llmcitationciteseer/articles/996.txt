Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed a controlled experiment where participants interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a VR game. Results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, with participants reporting higher levels of presence, flow, and overall satisfaction. We also found that personalized avatars reduce user anxiety and improve overall enjoyment. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems, suggesting that incorporating personalized avatars can enhance user experience and increase adoption.
