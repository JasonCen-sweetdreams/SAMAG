The increasing volume and variety of healthcare data necessitate efficient indexing and retrieval techniques to support timely diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the strengths of lexical and image-based retrieval methods for multi-modal healthcare data. Our proposed framework, called 'HealthIX', leverages a lexical index for text-based queries and a compact convolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based queries, while incorporating a relevance feedback mechanism to refine search results. Experimental evaluations on a large-scale healthcare dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.
