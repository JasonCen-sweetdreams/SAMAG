Query expansion is a crucial technique in ad-hoc retrieval to improve the performance of search engines. However, traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not capture the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. This paper proposes a neural query expansion approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages document embeddings learned from a large corpus to generate relevant expansion terms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuroQE on several standard benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of different document embedding architectures on query expansion performance.
