Real-time object detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicles, but existing methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper proposes a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework, 'AutoDetect', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the search process for real-time object detection models. We introduce a customized reward function that incorporates latency, accuracy, and computational resource constraints, enabling AutoDetect to discover efficient models that outperform state-of-the-art baselines on the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoDetect reduces inference latency by up to 30% while maintaining competitive mAP scores.
