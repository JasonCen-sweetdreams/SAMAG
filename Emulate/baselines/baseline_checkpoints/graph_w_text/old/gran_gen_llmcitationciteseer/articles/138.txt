Modern recommendation systems rely on graph-based methods to model user-item interactions. However, as the number of users and items grows, these methods become computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper proposes Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical graph clustering to reduce the computational complexity of graph attention mechanisms. HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale recommendation benchmarks, achieving a 2.5x speedup while maintaining comparable recommendation accuracy.
