This paper presents a novel decentralized approach to task allocation for autonomous agents in complex, dynamic environments. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that leverages both local and global state information to optimize task assignments. Our approach consists of two layers: a lower-level actor-critic network that learns to allocate tasks to individual agents, and a higher-level meta-controller that adjusts the actor's policy based on global system performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional, centralized allocation methods in terms of system efficiency, adaptability, and robustness to agent failures.
