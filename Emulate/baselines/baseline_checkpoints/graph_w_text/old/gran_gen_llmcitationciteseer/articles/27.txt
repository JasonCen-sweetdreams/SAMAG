Gesture recognition systems have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with dementia. However, existing systems often fail to account for the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a novel, inclusive gesture recognition framework that leverages a participatory design approach to involve older adults with dementia in the design process. Our system incorporates a machine learning-based gesture recognition algorithm that is trained on a dataset of gestures performed by older adults with dementia. We evaluate the system through a usability study with 20 participants and demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
