Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face scalability challenges due to the exponential growth of data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HiDIR', which significantly improves query performance in DIR systems. HiDIR leverages a multi-level indexing structure that adaptively partitions the document collection, enabling efficient query routing and reduction of inter-node communication. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale DIR testbed demonstrates that HiDIR outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 30% in query latency and 25% in resource utilization.
