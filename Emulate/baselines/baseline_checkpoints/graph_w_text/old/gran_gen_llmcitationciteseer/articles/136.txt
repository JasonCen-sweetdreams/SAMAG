Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan. Experimental results on a distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time.
