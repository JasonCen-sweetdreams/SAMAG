Neural search engines have revolutionized the field of information retrieval, but they often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to inject domain-specific knowledge into the search process. Our approach, called 'KG-Expand', uses a graph attention mechanism to select the most relevant entities and concepts from a knowledge graph, which are then used to expand the original query. Experimental results on the TREC CAR dataset show that KG-Expand significantly improves the retrieval performance of a state-of-the-art neural search engine, particularly for complex, open-domain queries.
