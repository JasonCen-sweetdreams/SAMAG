Older adults with cognitive impairments face significant barriers when interacting with conversational interfaces, leading to social isolation and decreased autonomy. This paper presents a novel design framework, 'EmpathChat', which incorporates insights from cognitive psychology and HCI to create more inclusive and supportive conversational interfaces. We conducted a participatory design process with older adults and caregivers, identifying key design principles for simplification, clarification, and emotional support. Our evaluation shows that EmpathChat significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction among older adults with cognitive impairments, while reducing caregiver burden.
