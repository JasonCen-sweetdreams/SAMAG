Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various applications, but it also poses unique challenges for visual search tasks. This paper investigates the effect of adaptive font sizes on visual search performance in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, who performed visual search tasks in a VR setup with varying font sizes. Our results show that adaptive font sizes can significantly improve visual search performance, particularly for elderly users. We also identify the optimal font size range for visual search tasks in VR and discuss implications for VR interface design.
