Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must cooperate to achieve a common goal. We propose a novel approach based on distributed constraint optimization, which enables agents to reason about the feasibility of tasks and allocate them efficiently. Our framework, called DCO-TA, uses a hierarchical decomposition of the constraint graph to reduce communication overhead and improve scalability. Experimental results on a logistics domain show that DCO-TA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of solution quality and communication efficiency.
