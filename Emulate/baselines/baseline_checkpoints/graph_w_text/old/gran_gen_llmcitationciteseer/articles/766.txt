Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing effective user interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of multimodal feedback in enhancing user experience in VR. We conducted a user study comparing three different feedback modalities: visual, haptic, and audio. Our results show that multimodal feedback significantly improves task performance, reduces user frustration, and enhances overall user experience. We also identify key design recommendations for VR interface designers to effectively incorporate multimodal feedback.
