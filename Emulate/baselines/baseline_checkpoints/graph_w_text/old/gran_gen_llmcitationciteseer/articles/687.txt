Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must dynamically allocate tasks to achieve global objectives. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn decentralized task allocation policies. We model the agent-task interaction as a graph and train a GNN to predict optimal task assignments. Our approach leverages the structural properties of the graph to facilitate decentralized decision-making, improving scalability and adaptability. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various multi-agent scenarios, outperforming traditional decentralized algorithms.
