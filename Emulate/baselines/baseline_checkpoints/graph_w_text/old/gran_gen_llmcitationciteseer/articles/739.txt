Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but traditional methods often suffer from high computational costs and suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'HDE-QE', which leverages hierarchical document embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and documents. By recursively expanding the query using a hierarchical attention mechanism, HDE-QE achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness while reducing computational overhead. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HDE-QE in enhancing retrieval performance, particularly for difficult queries.
