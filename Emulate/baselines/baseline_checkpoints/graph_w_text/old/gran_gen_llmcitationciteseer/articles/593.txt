Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to select optimal query plans based on a reward function that balances execution time and resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time, while adapting to changing workload patterns and system configurations.
