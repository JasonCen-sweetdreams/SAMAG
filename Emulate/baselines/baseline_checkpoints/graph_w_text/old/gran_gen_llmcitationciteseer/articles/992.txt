Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph data and the distributed nature of the underlying infrastructure. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph-based rewriting rules and distributed cost estimation techniques to efficiently optimize queries in distributed graph databases. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world graph dataset demonstrates that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
