This paper addresses the problem of coalition formation in autonomous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and objectives need to form coalitions to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a decentralized coalition formation algorithm based on distributed constraint optimization, which enables agents to negotiate and form coalitions without a centralized coordinator. Our approach incorporates a novel notion of 'coalition utility' that captures the added value of coalition membership, and uses a distributed iterative improvement strategy to converge to stable coalitions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of scenarios, including search and rescue, and environmental monitoring.
