Virtual reality (VR) systems often employ static color schemes, which can lead to visual discomfort, fatigue, and decreased user engagement. This paper investigates the effects of adaptive color schemes on user experience in VR environments. We propose a novel framework, 'ChromaVR', which utilizes real-time physiological and behavioral data to dynamically adjust the color palette of VR applications. Our user study involving 30 participants shows that ChromaVR significantly improves user comfort, reduces eye strain, and enhances overall VR experience. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the design of accessible and inclusive VR systems.
