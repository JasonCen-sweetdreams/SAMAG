Document retrieval in heterogeneous collections is challenging due to varying document lengths, formats, and semantic representations. This paper proposes a neural query expansion (NQE) approach that leverages a transformer-based architecture to learn context-aware query representations. NQE adaptively generates expansion terms based on the query context, document structure, and semantic relationships between tokens. Experiments on a large-scale heterogeneous dataset demonstrate that NQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 23% improvement in mean average precision and a 30% reduction in retrieval time.
