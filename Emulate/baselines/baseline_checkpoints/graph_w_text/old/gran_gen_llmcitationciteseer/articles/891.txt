Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promise, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. HAN combines multi-scale feature extraction with attention mechanisms to highlight relevant segments and features contributing to anomalies. Our experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides insightful explanations for anomalies.
