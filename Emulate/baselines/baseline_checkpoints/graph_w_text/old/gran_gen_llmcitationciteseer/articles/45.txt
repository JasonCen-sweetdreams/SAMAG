Gamified learning environments have shown promise in increasing user engagement, but static difficulty levels can lead to boredom or frustration. This paper presents an eye-tracking-based adaptive difficulty adjustment system, 'EyeGazeDiff', which dynamically adjusts task difficulty based on users' visual attention patterns. Our approach leverages machine learning models to correlate pupil dilation, fixation duration, and gaze trajectory with cognitive load, and adaptively adjusts task difficulty to maintain an optimal level of engagement. A user study with 40 participants demonstrates that EyeGazeDiff significantly improves learning outcomes and user satisfaction compared to traditional difficulty adjustment methods.
