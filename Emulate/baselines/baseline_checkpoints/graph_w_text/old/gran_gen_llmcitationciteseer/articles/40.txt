The growing older adult population with cognitive impairments, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, face significant challenges interacting with voice-based interfaces. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an inclusive voice-based interface, 'EASE', tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. Our approach incorporates cognitive load reduction techniques, personalized feedback mechanisms, and multimodal input support. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that EASE significantly improves task completion rates, reduces error rates, and enhances user satisfaction compared to existing voice-based interfaces.
