In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for optimizing system performance. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to learn effective allocation strategies. Our approach, called 'MATRL', uses a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn the optimal task allocation policy for each agent. We evaluate MATRL on a simulated robotic swarm scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and system efficiency compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
