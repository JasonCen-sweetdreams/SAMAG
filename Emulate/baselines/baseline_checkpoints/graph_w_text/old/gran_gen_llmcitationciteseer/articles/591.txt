As the global population ages, there is a growing need to design interfaces that cater to the unique needs of older adults. This study explores the benefits of incorporating emotion-driven adaptivity in user interfaces, particularly for this demographic. We present a novel framework, 'EmoAdapt', which leverages affective computing and machine learning to dynamically adjust interface parameters based on the user's emotional state. Our user study involving 40 older adults demonstrates that EmoAdapt significantly improves user experience, reduces cognitive load, and enhances overall system usability. The results have important implications for the development of accessible and empathetic technologies for aging populations.
