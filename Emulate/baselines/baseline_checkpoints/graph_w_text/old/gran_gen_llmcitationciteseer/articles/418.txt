Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to enrich the original query with relevant terms to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), which leverages the hierarchical structure of the query and document graphs to model semantic relationships between terms. HGAT adaptively weighs the importance of each term based on its contextual relevance, outperforming traditional query expansion methods. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving retrieval accuracy, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
