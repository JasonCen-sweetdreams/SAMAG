High-dimensional data indexing is a crucial task in various applications, including similarity search, nearest neighbor search, and clustering. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, 'LASH', which leverages Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to efficiently index high-dimensional data. LASH employs a combination of LSH and a hierarchical tree structure to reduce the search space and improve query performance. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that LASH outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of query efficiency and accuracy.
