In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our method, called GraphTask, leverages the communication graph of agents to learn a distributed task allocation policy. GraphTask is scalable, robust to agent failures, and adaptable to changing task requirements. Experiments on simulated multi-agent scenarios demonstrate that GraphTask outperforms traditional centralized and distributed task allocation algorithms in terms of overall system performance and fairness.
