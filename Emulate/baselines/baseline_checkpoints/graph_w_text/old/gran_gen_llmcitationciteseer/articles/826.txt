Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval that aims to improve the retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. Traditional query expansion methods rely on statistical techniques, which often suffer from limited contextual understanding and lack of domain knowledge. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'NeuroExpander', which leverages the capabilities of neural networks to capture complex semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExpander outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
