This paper addresses the problem of decentralized task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and preferences need to be assigned to tasks with varying rewards and deadlines. We propose a novel reward-shaping approach that incorporates agent-specific utility functions and task-oriented rewards, enabling agents to make informed decisions about task acceptance and allocation. Our approach is evaluated using a comprehensive simulation framework, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system efficiency compared to existing decentralized allocation methods.
