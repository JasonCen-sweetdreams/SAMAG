In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving complex goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective assignment strategies. Our approach represents agent capabilities and task requirements as graph structures, enabling the GNN to capture complex relationships and dependencies. We evaluate our framework on a variety of task allocation scenarios, demonstrating improved performance and adaptability compared to traditional centralized and distributed methods. The proposed approach has potential applications in autonomous systems, smart cities, and disaster response.
