Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but their reliance on standard query representations can limit their effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages term embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, dubbed 'TEQE', uses a graph-based algorithm to select expansion terms that are both relevant and diverse. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that TEQE significantly improves the retrieval performance of neural models, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
