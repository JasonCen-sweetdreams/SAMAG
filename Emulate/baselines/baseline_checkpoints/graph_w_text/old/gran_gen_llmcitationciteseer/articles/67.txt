Coordinating multi-agent systems in complex, dynamic environments poses significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates hierarchical task networks (HTNs) with Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to enable efficient and flexible coordination. HTNs provide a structured representation of tasks and subtasks, while MCTS allows agents to explore and adapt to changing circumstances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in a simulated disaster response scenario, showcasing improved coordination and response times compared to existing methods.
