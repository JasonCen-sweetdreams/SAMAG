Traditional ranking models for information retrieval rely on hand-crafted features and shallow learning architectures, which struggle to capture complex document relationships. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural network (HNN) architecture for document ranking, which leverages both local and global document representations. Our HNN model consists of multiple layers of neural networks, each learning to rank documents at increasingly abstract levels. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
