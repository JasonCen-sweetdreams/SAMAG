Explainable anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for many applications, including healthcare and finance. This paper introduces 'HATS', a novel hierarchical attention network that leverages both local and global patterns to identify anomalous segments. Our approach integrates a self-attention mechanism to weigh the importance of different time-series features and a hierarchical clustering module to capture multi-scale dependencies. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HATS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides interpretable explanations for identified anomalies.
