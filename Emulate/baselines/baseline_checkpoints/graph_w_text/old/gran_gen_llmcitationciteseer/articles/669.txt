Optimizing query execution plans in distributed database systems is a complex problem, especially in the presence of dynamic workloads and varying system conditions. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to query optimization, where an RL agent learns to adaptively select optimal execution plans based on feedback from the environment. We propose a novel RL framework, 'DQL-Opt', which leverages a combination of deep Q-learning and graph neural networks to model the distributed database system. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DQL-Opt outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimization techniques, achieving significant improvements in query response time and system throughput.
