Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of daily life, but its adoption is hindered by inaccessible interfaces for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework that incorporates tactile and auditory feedback to enable users with visual impairments to navigate and interact with virtual environments. Our user study with 20 participants demonstrates that the proposed framework significantly improves task completion times and user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-only interfaces. We also provide guidelines for designers and developers to create more inclusive VR experiences.
