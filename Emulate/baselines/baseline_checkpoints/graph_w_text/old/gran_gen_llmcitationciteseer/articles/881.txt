Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the impact of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed an experiment with 120 participants, who interacted with either a personalized or generic avatar in a VR game. Results show that users with personalized avatars demonstrated higher levels of engagement, including increased time spent in the VR environment and improved self-reported enjoyment. Additionally, we observed a significant correlation between avatar personalization and user self-efficacy. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems and highlight the potential of personalized avatars to enhance user experience.
