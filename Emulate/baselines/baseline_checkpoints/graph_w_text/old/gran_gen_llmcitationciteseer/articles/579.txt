Distributed databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data processing systems. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed query execution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query execution plans based on the database's workload and system dynamics. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database show that our approach achieves an average of 30% improvement in query response time compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
