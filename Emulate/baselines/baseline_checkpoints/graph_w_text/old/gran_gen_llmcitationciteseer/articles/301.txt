Explainability and transparency are crucial in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) systems, where agents interact and learn from each other in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables agents to selectively focus on relevant features and communicate effectively with each other. Our approach incorporates attention mechanisms at both the local and global levels, allowing agents to reason about their own actions and the actions of others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a variety of MARL benchmarks, including autonomous driving and robotic soccer, and provide insights into the decision-making process of the agents.
