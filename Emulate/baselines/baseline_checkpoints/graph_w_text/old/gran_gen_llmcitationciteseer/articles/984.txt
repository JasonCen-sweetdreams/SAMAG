Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database. Experimental results on a real-world DDS show that our approach achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance compared to traditional optimization techniques.
