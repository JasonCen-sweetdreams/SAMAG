Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings informed the development of 'CognitiveCare', a conversational AI system that incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified language, visual cues, and error tolerance. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
