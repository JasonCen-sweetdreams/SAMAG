Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often neglect the needs of this demographic, leading to user frustration and disengagement. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible and inclusive VR interfaces tailored to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with 15 older adults and 5 caregivers, resulting in a set of design guidelines and principles for VR interface design. We evaluated the efficacy of these guidelines through a usability study with 20 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in user engagement and task completion rates.
