Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their lack of emotional intelligence hinders effective human-computer interaction. This paper presents a study on user perception and trust in voice assistants with varying levels of emotional intelligence. We designed and implemented an emotionally intelligent voice assistant, 'EmpathyAI', which recognizes and responds to user emotions. Our user study (N=120) reveals that EmpathyAI significantly increases user trust and satisfaction compared to traditional voice assistants. We also identify key design factors influencing user perception of emotional intelligence in voice assistants, including empathy, tone, and linguistic cues.
