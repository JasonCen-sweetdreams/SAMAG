The increasing adoption of NoSQL databases for big data analytics has led to a growing need for efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'CORTEX', specifically designed for real-time analytics on column-oriented NoSQL databases. CORTEX leverages a cost-based optimization approach that takes into account the unique characteristics of column-store data layout and the query patterns of analytical workloads. Our experiments on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that CORTEX achieves an average query performance improvement of 3.5x compared to existing optimization techniques.
