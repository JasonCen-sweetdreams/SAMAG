Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but gesture recognition remains a significant challenge. This study explores the role of embodied cognition in VR-based gesture recognition, examining how users' bodily experiences influence their interactions. We designed an experiment using a custom-built VR platform, where participants performed a series of gestures while their body tracking data and cognitive loads were recorded. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly impacts gesture recognition accuracy, with users exhibiting improved performance when their bodily experiences align with the virtual environment. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of more intuitive and effective VR interfaces.
