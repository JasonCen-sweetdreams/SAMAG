This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-robot systems, where autonomous agents negotiate and allocate tasks based on their capabilities and environmental factors. We introduce a novel auction-based mechanism that integrates task prioritization, robot resource allocation, and collision avoidance. Our approach is validated through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced robot collisions compared to traditional centralized approaches. We also analyze the impact of agent heterogeneity and environmental uncertainty on task allocation performance.
