Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in medical image segmentation tasks, but they often lack uncertainty estimates, which are crucial for clinical decision-making. This paper proposes a Bayesian neural network (BNN) framework for uncertainty estimation in medical image segmentation. We develop a hierarchical variational inference method that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Experimental results on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrate that our BNN framework outperforms standard CNNs in terms of uncertainty calibration and segmentation accuracy, while providing reliable uncertainty estimates for uncertain regions.
