The proliferation of heterogeneous data sources has created a pressing need for efficient query optimization techniques. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for complex queries involving multiple data sources. Our framework, 'QOptRL', utilizes a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the characteristics of the data sources and the query workload. Experimental results demonstrate that QOptRL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
