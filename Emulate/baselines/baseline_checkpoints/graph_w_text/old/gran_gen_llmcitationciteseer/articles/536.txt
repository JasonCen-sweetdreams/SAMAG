Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern datacenters, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust query execution plans based on real-time workload characteristics. Our RL-based optimizer, called 'QueryMaster', learns to predict optimal join orders, indexing strategies, and parallelization schemes through trial and error, adapting to changing data distributions and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that QueryMaster outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
