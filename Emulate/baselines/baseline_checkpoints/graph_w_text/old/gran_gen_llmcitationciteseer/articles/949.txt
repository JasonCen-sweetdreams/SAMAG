Main-memory database systems have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics and transactional workloads. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ParOpt', that leverages massively parallel processing (MPP) capabilities to minimize query latency. ParOpt employs a hybrid approach combining rule-based and cost-based optimization techniques, along with a dynamic workload-aware scheduling strategy. Experimental results on a real-world benchmark demonstrate that ParOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3.5x in terms of query execution time, while maintaining a low optimization overhead.
