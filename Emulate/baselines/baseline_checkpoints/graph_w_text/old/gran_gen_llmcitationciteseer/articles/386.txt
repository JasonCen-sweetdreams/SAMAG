Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when faced with limited labeled data. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical meta-learning approach, 'HML-Net', which leverages a nested episodic training strategy to adapt to new tasks. By learning a hierarchical representation of task-specific knowledge, HML-Net demonstrates improved performance on benchmark datasets, such as Mini-ImageNet and CIFAR-FS, compared to existing state-of-the-art models. We analyze the impact of various architectural components and provide insights into the learned hierarchical representations.
