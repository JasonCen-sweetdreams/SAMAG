Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities need to be assigned to tasks with different requirements. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies. Our approach, dubbed 'GNN-Alloc', leverages the structural properties of the agent-task graph to predict optimal assignments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-Alloc in a simulated disaster response scenario, showing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional methods.
