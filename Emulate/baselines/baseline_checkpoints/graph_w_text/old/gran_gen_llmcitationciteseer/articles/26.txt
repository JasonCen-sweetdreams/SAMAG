Anomaly detection is a crucial task in many applications, but it becomes increasingly challenging in high-dimensional data due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm, 'HDSCAN', which leverages a probabilistic density-based approach to identify anomalies in a scalable and efficient manner. We introduce a tree-based data structure that adaptively partitions the data into dense regions and outlier clusters, enabling fast anomaly detection and visualization. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate HDSCAN's superiority over existing methods in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness to noise and outliers.
