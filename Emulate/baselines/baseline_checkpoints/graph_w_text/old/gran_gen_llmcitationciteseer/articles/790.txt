The cold start problem remains a significant challenge in recommendation systems, where new users or items lack sufficient interaction history. This paper proposes a hybrid retrieval model, 'HyRec', which combines the strengths of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to tackle this issue. HyRec incorporates a graph attention network to capture complex user-item relationships and a dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) module to encode item content. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyRec outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and A/B testing metrics, particularly for cold start users and items.
