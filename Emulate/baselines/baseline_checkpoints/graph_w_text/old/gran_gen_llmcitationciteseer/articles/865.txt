Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop accessible and inclusive VR interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops and usability studies to identify key design recommendations, including simplified menus, auditory cues, and personalized avatars. Our findings suggest that incorporating these design elements can significantly improve the usability and engagement of VR experiences for older adults with cognitive impairments.
