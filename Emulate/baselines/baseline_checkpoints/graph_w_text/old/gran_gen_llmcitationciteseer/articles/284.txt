Deep neural networks are prone to overconfident predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, leading to unreliable decision-making in real-world applications. This paper presents a novel approach to OOD detection using deep residual neural networks (ResNets). By introducing a residual connection-based uncertainty module, we enable the network to capture input-dependent uncertainty estimates. Our method, dubbed 'ResOOD', achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, outperforming existing OOD detection methods. We further demonstrate the efficacy of ResOOD in real-world scenarios, including autonomous driving and medical image analysis.
