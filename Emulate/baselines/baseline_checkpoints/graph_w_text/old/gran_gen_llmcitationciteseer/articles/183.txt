Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraDI', which leverages graph theory to efficiently optimize queries in distributed settings. GraDI constructs a graph representation of the database schema and uses graph algorithms to identify optimal query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraDI outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
