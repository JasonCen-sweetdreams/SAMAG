In multi-agent systems, coordinating agents to allocate resources efficiently is crucial. However, trusting other agents' intentions and capabilities is a significant challenge. This paper proposes an adaptive trust mechanism, 'TrustAware', which enables agents to dynamically assess and adjust their trust levels based on past interactions and feedback. Our approach integrates a probabilistic trust model with a distributed constraint satisfaction algorithm to optimize resource allocation. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that TrustAware achieves up to 25% improvement in resource utilization and 30% reduction in communication overhead compared to traditional trust-based approaches.
