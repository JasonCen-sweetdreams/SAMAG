People with disabilities face significant barriers when interacting with visualizations, hindering their ability to access and understand data. This paper presents a novel framework for designing adaptive visualizations that cater to diverse accessibility needs. We introduce a machine learning-based approach that dynamically adjusts visualization parameters, such as color, size, and layout, based on user preferences and abilities. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that our approach improves comprehension and engagement for users with visual impairments, while also enhancing overall user experience.
