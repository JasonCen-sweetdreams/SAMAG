Individuals with dyslexia often face barriers when interacting with conversational interfaces, such as chatbots and voice assistants. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating accessible conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of individuals with dyslexia. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving co-design workshops, usability testing, and cognitive walkthroughs to identify design principles and guidelines for dyslexia-friendly conversational interfaces. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal input options, visual feedback, and error tolerance in facilitating accessible and inclusive interaction experiences.
