Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant system, 'EasyVoice', tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key pain points and design requirements. Our system incorporates a range of features, including simplified language processing, personalized promptings, and multimodal feedback. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates that EasyVoice significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
