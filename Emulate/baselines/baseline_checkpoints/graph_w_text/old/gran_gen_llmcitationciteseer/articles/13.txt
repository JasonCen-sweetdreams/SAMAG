Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query execution times. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
