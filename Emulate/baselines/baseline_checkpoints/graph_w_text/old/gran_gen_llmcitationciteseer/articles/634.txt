As the global population ages, designing accessible conversational interfaces becomes crucial for promoting social inclusion among older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the design requirements for conversational agents that cater to this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improving conversational flow, language comprehension, and user engagement. Our findings inform the development of a novel design framework, 'CARE', which prioritizes simplicity, consistency, and emotional support in conversational interfaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of CARE through a prototype evaluation, showcasing improved user experience and task completion rates for older adults with cognitive impairments.
