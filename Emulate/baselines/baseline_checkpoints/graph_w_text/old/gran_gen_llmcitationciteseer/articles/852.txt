Database indexing is a crucial optimization technique for improving query performance. However, traditional indexing methods often rely on static heuristics and fail to adapt to dynamic workload changes. This paper presents 'Predix', a novel predictive indexing framework that leverages machine learning to forecast query patterns and proactively create optimal indexes. Our approach integrates a graph-based query analysis module with a probabilistic indexing optimizer, achieving an average query latency reduction of 35% compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques. We evaluate Predix on a real-world e-commerce database and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling diverse query workloads.
