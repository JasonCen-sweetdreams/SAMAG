Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, have become ubiquitous, but their design often inadvertently excludes people with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces, focusing on individuals with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with stakeholders from disability organizations and developed a set of guidelines for designing accessible conversational interfaces. Our evaluation with 30 participants with disabilities shows significant improvements in user experience and accessibility compared to existing conversational interfaces.
