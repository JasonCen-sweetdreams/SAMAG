This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and resource constraints need to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose an auction-based mechanism that leverages the concept of virtual currencies to facilitate efficient task assignment. Our approach ensures that agents with higher capabilities are incentivized to participate in tasks that require their expertise, while also promoting fairness and robustness in the face of agent failures or departures. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing task completion time and improving overall system performance.
