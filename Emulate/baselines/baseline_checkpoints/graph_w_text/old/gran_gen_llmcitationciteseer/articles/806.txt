Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to improve the retrieval effectiveness by incorporating relevant terms into the original query. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, leveraging semantic embeddings to capture the context and relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'SEMEX', employs a neural network to learn dense vector representations of terms, which are then used to generate expanded queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEMEX outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
