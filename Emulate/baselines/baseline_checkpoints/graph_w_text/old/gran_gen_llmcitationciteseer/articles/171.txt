Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent from short, ambiguous queries. We propose a novel approach to query expansion using neural graph embeddings, which learn to represent queries and documents as dense vectors in a shared semantic space. Our method, dubbed 'GraphEx', leverages graph attention to identify relevant terms and phrases in the document graph, and then uses these to expand the original query. Experimental results on several standard benchmarks show that GraphEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
