Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for elderly users with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an accessible conversational interface tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 elderly participants with cognitive impairments, revealing key design recommendations for simplifying dialogue flows, enhancing visual cues, and providing cognitive support. A usability evaluation of our prototype demonstrates significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates compared to existing conversational interfaces.
