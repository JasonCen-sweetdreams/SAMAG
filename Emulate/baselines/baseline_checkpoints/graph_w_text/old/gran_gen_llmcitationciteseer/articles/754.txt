Real-time data warehousing applications require efficient query optimization to minimize latency and maximize throughput. This paper proposes a novel adaptive query optimization framework, 'AQOR', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust query execution plans based on workload patterns and system resource utilization. AQOR uses a neural network to learn the optimal query plan given the current system state, and demonstrates improved performance and adaptability compared to traditional query optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world data warehousing benchmark show that AQOR reduces query latency by up to 35% and improves system throughput by up to 25%
