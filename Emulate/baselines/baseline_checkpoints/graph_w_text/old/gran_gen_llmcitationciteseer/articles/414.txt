Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with visual impairments face significant barriers in accessing and interacting with VR environments. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework, 'VIABLE', which incorporates audio-haptic feedback and spatial audio cues to enable users with visual impairments to navigate and interact with virtual objects. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that VIABLE significantly improved task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-based VR interfaces. Our findings provide insights into the design of accessible VR interfaces that can benefit a broader range of users.
