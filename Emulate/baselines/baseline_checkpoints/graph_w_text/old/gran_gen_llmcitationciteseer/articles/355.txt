Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and network communication. This paper proposes a novel graph-based query rewriting approach, 'DistroRewrite', which leverages graph theory to identify and rewrite suboptimal query plans. Our approach reduces query execution time by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques. We also develop a cost-based optimizer that selects the best rewriting strategy based on query characteristics and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate the effectiveness of DistroRewrite in improving query performance.
