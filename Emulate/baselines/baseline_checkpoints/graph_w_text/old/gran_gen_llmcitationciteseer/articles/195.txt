Virtual reality (VR) environments have the potential to revolutionize various industries, but the lack of intuitive interaction methods hinders their adoption. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction system for VR, leveraging deep learning to predict user intentions. Our system, called GazeVR, utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze the user's gaze patterns and detect specific gestures, enabling seamless interaction with virtual objects. We evaluate GazeVR in a series of user studies, demonstrating its high accuracy and usability in various VR scenarios.
