Explainable recommendation systems are crucial for building trust with users. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that captures complex user-item relationships and generates personalized explanations. HGAT consists of two hierarchical attention layers: a user-level attention layer that models user preferences and an item-level attention layer that captures item relationships. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.
