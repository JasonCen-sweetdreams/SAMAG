Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. While existing methods leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to model user-item interactions, they often fail to provide interpretable explanations for the recommended items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HiGAT) for ERS, which captures both local and global graph structures. HiGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify key items and user behaviors that influence the recommendation process. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, demonstrating the superior performance and explainability of HiGAT compared to state-of-the-art ERS methods.
