Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights. Our HAN model consists of a temporal attention module that captures long-range dependencies and a spatial attention module that highlights relevant features. We evaluate our approach on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both detection accuracy and explainability. Additionally, we provide a visual analytics framework to facilitate understanding of the anomaly detection process.
