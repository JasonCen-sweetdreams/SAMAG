Virtual reality (VR) gaming has seen significant growth in recent years, but user engagement remains a major challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR games. We designed an experiment where participants played a VR game with either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that users who played with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, as measured by playtime, satisfaction, and social presence. We also found that personalization had a greater impact on users with low gaming experience. Our findings have implications for the design of VR games and the use of avatars in virtual environments.
