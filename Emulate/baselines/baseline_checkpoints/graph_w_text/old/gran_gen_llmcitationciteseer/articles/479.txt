Subgraph matching is a fundamental problem in graph databases, with applications in social network analysis, bioinformatics, and recommendation systems. However, existing indexing techniques suffer from scalability limitations, leading to poor performance on large graphs. This paper presents 'GrafIndex', a novel indexing framework that leverages graph summarization and bloom filters to accelerate subgraph matching queries. Our experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GrafIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3 orders of magnitude, while maintaining a reasonable indexing overhead.
