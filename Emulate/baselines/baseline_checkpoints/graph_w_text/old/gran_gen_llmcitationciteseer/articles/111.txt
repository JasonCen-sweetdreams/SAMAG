This paper presents a novel autonomous agent-based approach for resource allocation in distributed systems. Our proposed framework, 'AgentRA', utilizes a decentralized multi-agent system to optimize resource allocation and minimize communication overhead. We employ a hybrid negotiation protocol, combining auction-based and contract-net protocols, to facilitate efficient resource allocation among agents. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentRA achieves significant improvements in system throughput and response time compared to traditional centralized approaches.
