Short-text documents pose significant challenges for information retrieval systems due to their limited contextual information. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-Short', that leverages both local and global context to improve retrieval performance. HQE-Short involves a two-stage process: first, we apply a local expansion method using word embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships within the short-text document; then, we hierarchically expand the query using a global knowledge graph to incorporate domain-specific knowledge. Experimental results on several benchmark short-text datasets demonstrate that HQE-Short outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
