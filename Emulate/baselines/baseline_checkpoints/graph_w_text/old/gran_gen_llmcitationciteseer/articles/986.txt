Recommender systems play a vital role in personalized services, yet their opacity hinders trust and interpretability. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework, which integrates user-item interactions and side information as a hierarchical graph structure. HGAT leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges, generating explainable recommendations. Our experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both accuracy and explainability, providing insights into the recommendation process.
