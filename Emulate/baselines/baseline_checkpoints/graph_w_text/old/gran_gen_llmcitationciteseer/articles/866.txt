Ad-hoc search systems struggle to scale with the exponential growth of document collections. This paper presents a novel approach to improve retrieval efficiency by leveraging hierarchical document embeddings. Our method, dubbed 'HiDE', represents documents as a hierarchical composition of semantic concepts, enabling efficient similarity computation and filtering of irrelevant documents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HiDE on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant reductions in query latency and improving overall retrieval quality.
