Optimizing query execution in distributed database systems is a complex problem due to the vast space of possible query plans. Traditional approaches rely on hand-tuned heuristics or exhaustive search, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'RL-Opt', that leverages reinforcement learning to learn query optimization strategies. We design a reward function that captures query execution time, resource utilization, and data freshness, and train an agent to select optimal query plans using a deep Q-network. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 35% in terms of query execution time.
