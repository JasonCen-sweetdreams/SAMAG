This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for cooperative agents, where agents bid for tasks using an auction-based mechanism. Our approach, called 'CoopAuction', leverages the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to ensure truthfulness and efficiency. We show that CoopAuction converges to a Nash equilibrium and outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in dynamic, real-world environments.
