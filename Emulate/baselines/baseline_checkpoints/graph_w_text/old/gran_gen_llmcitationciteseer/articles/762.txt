Emotion recognition from multimodal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the inherent heterogeneity and redundancy of the data. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that selectively focuses on relevant modalities and features to improve emotion recognition. Our HAN framework consists of a modality-specific attention mechanism and a hierarchical fusion layer, enabling the model to capture both local and global patterns. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion methods, achieving a 12.5% relative improvement in emotion recognition accuracy.
