Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults, leading to frustration and exclusion. This paper presents a novel, empathy-driven approach to designing voice assistants that cater to this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, identifying key pain points and areas for improvement. Our proposed framework, 'EmpaVoice', incorporates tailored dialogue management, personalized feedback, and adaptive error handling to enhance usability and accessibility. A user study with 30 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
