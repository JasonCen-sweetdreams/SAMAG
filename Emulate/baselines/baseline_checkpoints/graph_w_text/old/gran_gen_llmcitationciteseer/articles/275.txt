Conversational interfaces, such as chatbots and voice assistants, have become increasingly prevalent in modern computing. However, people with disabilities often face significant barriers when interacting with these systems. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for designing inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of individuals with disabilities. We propose a set of guidelines and recommendations for interface designers, focusing on accessibility, usability, and user experience. Our evaluation of a prototype conversational interface demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving interaction outcomes for users with disabilities.
