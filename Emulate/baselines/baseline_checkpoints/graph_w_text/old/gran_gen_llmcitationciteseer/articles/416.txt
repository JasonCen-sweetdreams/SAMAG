Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly popular for controlling smart home devices. However, individuals with disabilities often face significant barriers when interacting with these systems. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop accessible voice-based interfaces for smart home devices. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with individuals with disabilities to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed design framework incorporates personalized voice commands, multimodal feedback, and adaptive error handling to enhance usability and accessibility. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and user satisfaction.
