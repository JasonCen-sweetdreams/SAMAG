Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces, focusing on non-visual feedback and interaction methods. We conducted a series of user studies with visually impaired participants to inform the design of our system, which incorporates 3D audio cues, haptic feedback, and gesture recognition. Our evaluation shows that our approach enables users with visual impairments to effectively navigate and interact with virtual environments, with significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction.
