Question answering (QA) systems often struggle to accurately identify and corefer entities in complex, open-domain texts. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'EDCORE', that integrates entity disambiguation and coreference resolution to enhance QA performance. We develop a neural network-based approach that jointly models entity linking and coreference resolution, allowing the system to capture subtle relationships between entities and pronouns. Experiments on popular QA datasets demonstrate that EDCORE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, especially on questions requiring coreference resolution and entity disambiguation.
