Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are ubiquitous in real-world applications, but node classification in these networks remains a challenging task. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) model that leverages the hierarchical structure of HINs to learn node representations. HGAT consists of a stacked attention mechanism that adaptively selects relevant nodes and attributes across different network layers, allowing it to capture complex dependencies between nodes. Experiments on several benchmark HIN datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and F1-score.
