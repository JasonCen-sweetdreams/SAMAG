Knowledge graph completion is a crucial task in natural language processing, but it is often hindered by the presence of ambiguous entities. This paper proposes a novel entity disambiguation approach using graph attention networks (GATs) to improve knowledge graph completion. Our method, called GAT-ED, incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global context in the knowledge graph. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that GAT-ED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in entity disambiguation and knowledge graph completion tasks, achieving an average improvement of 12.5% in F1-score.
