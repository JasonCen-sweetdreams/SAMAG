The deep web, comprising vast amounts of hidden web content, poses significant challenges for traditional search engines. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'DeepCrawl', to efficiently retrieve deep web content. We model the crawling process as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to navigate the web graph, prioritize unseen pages, and adapt to changing web structures. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that DeepCrawl outperforms state-of-the-art crawling strategies in terms of coverage, freshness, and relevance, while reducing the crawling overhead by up to 30%.
