Query reformulation is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the relevance and ranking of retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, called QRL-Agent, to learn an optimal query reformulation strategy. QRL-Agent leverages a Markov decision process to model the query reformulation process and employs a deep Q-network to learn the reformulation policy. Experimental results on the TREC dataset show that QRL-Agent outperforms state-of-the-art query reformulation methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
