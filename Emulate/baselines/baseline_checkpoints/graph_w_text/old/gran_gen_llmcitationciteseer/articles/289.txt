Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but gesture recognition accuracy remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effect of visual feedback on gesture recognition in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, comparing three visual feedback conditions: (1) no feedback, (2) real-time 3D skeleton visualization, and (3) augmented reality (AR) feedback with virtual hands. Our results show that both 3D skeleton and AR feedback significantly improve gesture recognition accuracy, with the AR condition achieving the highest accuracy. We also found that users with higher levels of VR experience benefited more from visual feedback. Our findings have implications for the design of more accurate and user-friendly VR systems.
