Column-oriented storage systems have become increasingly popular in big data analytics due to their ability to efficiently process queries with selective predicates. However, the performance of these systems can be significantly impacted by the choice of data partitioning strategy. This paper proposes an adaptive data partitioning approach that dynamically adjusts the partitioning scheme based on query workload characteristics. Our approach leverages a cost-based optimizer to select the optimal partitioning strategy for each query, resulting in improved query performance and reduced storage overhead. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 3x improvement in query throughput compared to traditional fixed-partitioning schemes.
