Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces that can be used by individuals with visual impairments. We propose a set of guidelines and heuristics for creating accessible VR interfaces, and evaluate their effectiveness through a user study with 20 participants. The results show that our proposed framework significantly improves the usability and accessibility of VR interfaces for users with visual impairments.
