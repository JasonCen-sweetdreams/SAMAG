Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has seen significant progress with the advent of dense retrieval methods. However, these approaches often suffer from computational inefficiencies, particularly during the passage retrieval stage. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval framework, 'HDRetriever', which leverages a two-stage ranking mechanism to efficiently identify relevant passages from a large corpus. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDRetriever achieves comparable retrieval performance to state-of-the-art models while reducing computational costs by up to 75%.
