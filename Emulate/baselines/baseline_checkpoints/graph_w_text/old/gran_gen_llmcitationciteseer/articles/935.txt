Real-time traffic management is a complex problem that requires coordinating multiple agents to optimize traffic flow and minimize congestion. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for coordinating multi-agent systems in real-time traffic management. Our approach consists of a high-level controller that sets traffic signal timings and a low-level controller that adjusts lane usage. We employ a decentralized Q-network to learn the optimal policy for each agent, and a hierarchical decomposition of the Q-function to enable efficient exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing congestion and travel time.
