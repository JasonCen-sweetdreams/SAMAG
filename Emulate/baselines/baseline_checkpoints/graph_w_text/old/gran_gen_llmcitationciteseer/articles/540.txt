This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing gesture-based interfaces for older adults with dementia. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with caregivers and individuals with dementia to identify key challenges and opportunities for gesture-based interaction. Our findings inform the development of 'Ease Gestures', a novel interface framework that incorporates simplicity, consistency, and error tolerance to accommodate cognitive and motor impairments. A usability study with 20 older adults with dementia demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional touchscreen interfaces.
