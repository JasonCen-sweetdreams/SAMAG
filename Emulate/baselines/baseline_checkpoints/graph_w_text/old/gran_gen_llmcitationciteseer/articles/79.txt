Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel VR interface design that incorporates a combination of audio and haptic feedback to facilitate intuitive navigation and interaction for visually impaired users. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that our design significantly improved task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our findings provide valuable insights for designing inclusive VR experiences that can be enjoyed by a broader population.
