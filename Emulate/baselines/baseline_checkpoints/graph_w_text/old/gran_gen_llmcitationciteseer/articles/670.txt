Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn decentralized task allocation policies. We model the agent interactions as a graph and design a GNN-based framework that can learn to allocate tasks efficiently in a decentralized manner. Our approach is evaluated on a variety of benchmark scenarios, demonstrating improved performance and scalability compared to traditional methods. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the optimality of the learned policies.
