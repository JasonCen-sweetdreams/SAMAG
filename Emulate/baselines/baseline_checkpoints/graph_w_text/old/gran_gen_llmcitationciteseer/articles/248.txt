Existing graph-based recommendation systems (RS) suffer from scalability issues due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages a hierarchical graph structure to reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance. HGAT uses a bottom-up attention mechanism to aggregate node features and a top-down attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant subgraphs. Experimental results on large-scale datasets demonstrate that HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing inference time by up to 75% compared to existing graph-based RS models.
