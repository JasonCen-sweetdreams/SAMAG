Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user experience is heavily influenced by the sense of embodiment in virtual environments. This study investigates the effects of personalized avatar embodiment on user experience in VR. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 60 participants, using a custom-built VR platform that allowed for real-time avatar customization. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance user engagement, presence, and overall satisfaction, particularly among female participants. We discuss implications for VR interface design and future research directions.
