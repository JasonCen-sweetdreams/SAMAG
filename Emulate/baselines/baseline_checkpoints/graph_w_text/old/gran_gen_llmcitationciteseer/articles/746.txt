Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of complex queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper introduces a novel approach to query expansion using neural query graphs (NQGs), which model the query as a graph of related concepts. We propose a neural network architecture that learns to generate NQGs from raw queries, and demonstrate its effectiveness in expanding queries to improve retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
