Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. While deep learning methods have shown promise, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our HAN architecture incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales, enabling the model to focus on relevant segments and features. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we provide visualizations and feature importance scores to facilitate model interpretability and trustworthiness.
