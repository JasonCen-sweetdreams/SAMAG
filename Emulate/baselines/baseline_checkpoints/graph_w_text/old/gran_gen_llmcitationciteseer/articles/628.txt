Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph structures and the need to balance query latency with resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach, 'GraphRL', which leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select optimal query plans for distributed graph databases. We design a custom reward function that incorporates query latency, resource utilization, and graph structure characteristics. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphRL outperforms existing query optimization techniques, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2x reduction in resource utilization.
