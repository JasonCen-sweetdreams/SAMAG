As graph databases continue to grow in size and complexity, query optimization becomes a critical challenge. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'GraphHive', which leverages a hierarchical, partitioned indexing strategy to accelerate graph query processing. By adaptively grouping graph nodes based on structural and semantic features, GraphHive reduces query latency by up to 70% compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods. We evaluate GraphHive on several real-world graph datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in supporting complex graph queries at scale.
