Query expansion is a crucial component in Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as it directly affects the relevance and ranking of retrieved documents. Existing methods rely on manual tuning of parameters or simplistic heuristics, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel adaptive query expansion framework, 'DeepQX', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion strategies. By modeling the IR system as a Markov Decision Process, DeepQX learns to adaptively select expansion terms and weights based on user feedback and document relevance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
