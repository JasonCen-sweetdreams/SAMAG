Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been increasingly used in healthcare to provide emotional support and companionship to patients. However, most ECAs lack emotional intelligence, leading to limited empathy and understanding in interactions. This paper presents a novel ECA framework, 'EmpaCare', which integrates emotional intelligence into the agent's dialogue management and nonverbal behavior generation. We conducted a user study with patients with chronic illnesses and found that EmpaCare significantly improved user engagement, trust, and emotional well-being compared to a baseline ECA. Our results demonstrate the potential of emotionally intelligent ECAs in improving healthcare outcomes.
