Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) contain diverse node types and edge relations, making node classification a challenging task. Existing graph neural network (GNN) approaches struggle to model complex dependencies between nodes. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework that leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture multi-scale node representations in HINs. HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs on various HIN datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in node classification tasks.
