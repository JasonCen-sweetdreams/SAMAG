Zero-shot learning (ZSL) has gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large datasets and complex relationships between classes. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages graph neural networks to model class relationships and attention mechanisms to focus on relevant neighbors. Our approach enables ZSL to scale to large datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. We also provide theoretical analysis and insights into the effectiveness of HGAT in ZSL scenarios.
