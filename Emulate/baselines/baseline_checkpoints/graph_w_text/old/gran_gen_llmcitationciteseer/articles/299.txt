Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and network topology. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process and use a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query planning. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
