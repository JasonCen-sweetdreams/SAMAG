Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it enhances the retrieval effectiveness by incorporating relevant terms into the original query. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query expansion, which leverages semantic embeddings to capture the relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed GraphEx, constructs a weighted graph from the query context and uses graph convolutional networks to learn term representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
