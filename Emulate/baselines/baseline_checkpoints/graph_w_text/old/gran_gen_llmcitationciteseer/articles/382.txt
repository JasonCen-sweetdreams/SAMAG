Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, which aims to reformulate the original query to better capture the user's intent. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and suffer from limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'NeuroQE', that learns to expand queries in an end-to-end manner. Our model leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture both local and global patterns in the query and document representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance over state-of-the-art methods, with a notable reduction in computational overhead.
