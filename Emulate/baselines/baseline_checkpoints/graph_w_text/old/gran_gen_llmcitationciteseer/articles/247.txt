This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for autonomous traffic signal control. We model the traffic network as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and employ a deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) to learn cooperative policies for the traffic signals. The proposed approach is evaluated on a real-world traffic scenario, demonstrating significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional optimization methods. We also investigate the impact of communication latency and agent heterogeneity on the system's performance.
