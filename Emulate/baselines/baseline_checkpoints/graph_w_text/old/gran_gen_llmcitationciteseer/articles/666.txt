Ad-hoc retrieval often relies on query expansion to improve retrieval effectiveness. However, existing methods can be computationally expensive and may not capture nuanced semantic relationships between words. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages hierarchical word embeddings to identify context-dependent synonyms and hyponyms. We demonstrate that our method, HierExpan, outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on several benchmark datasets, including TREC and Robust04. Furthermore, we show that HierExpan can be efficiently integrated into existing retrieval models, such as BM25 and Language Models, to achieve significant gains in retrieval performance.
