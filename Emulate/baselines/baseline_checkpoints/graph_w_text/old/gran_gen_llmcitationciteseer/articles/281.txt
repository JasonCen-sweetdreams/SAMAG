Online transaction fraud detection is a pressing concern, with graph-based methods showing promise. However, existing approaches struggle to capture complex relationships between transactions and users. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture, which leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant transactions and user features. HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a large-scale e-commerce dataset, achieving a 12% improvement in F1-score and 35% reduction in false positives. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in detecting fraudulent transactions and its potential for real-world deployment.
