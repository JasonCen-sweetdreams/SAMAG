E-commerce search engines often struggle to capture diverse query intent, leading to inadequate search results. This paper proposes an adaptive re-ranking framework, 'IntentDiver', which leverages a novel combination of query embeddings, item attributes, and user behavior to identify and promote diverse results. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning strategy to adapt to changing user behavior and query distributions. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search result diversity, user engagement, and conversion rates compared to state-of-the-art re-ranking methods.
