Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has exhibited promising results in complex environments, but the lack of interpretability hinders its applicability in real-world scenarios. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable MARL. Our approach integrates attention mechanisms at both the agent and team levels, allowing for the identification of influential agents and their contributions to team decisions. Experimental results on a suite of MARL benchmarks demonstrate that HAN achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing insightful explanations of agent behaviors and team strategies.
