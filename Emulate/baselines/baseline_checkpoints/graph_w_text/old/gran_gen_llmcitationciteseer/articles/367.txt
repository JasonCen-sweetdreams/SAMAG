Query expansion is a crucial component of document retrieval systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and retrieve relevant documents. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HiQE', which leverages both local and global context to generate effective expansion terms. Our approach utilizes a combination of word embeddings and graph-based methods to model the semantic relationships between query terms and the document collection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiQE outperforms existing query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
