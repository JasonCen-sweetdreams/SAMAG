Optimizing queries for multi-dimensional data is crucial for efficient data retrieval in various applications. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using genetic algorithms. We introduce a fitness function that incorporates both query cost and data distribution, enabling the genetic algorithm to explore a vast solution space. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 3.2x for complex queries. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the genetic algorithm's convergence and sensitivity to parameter settings.
