The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of sensor data, necessitating efficient real-time integration and querying mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'SensorGraph', which leverages the structural properties of IoT sensor networks to accelerate data integration and querying. Our approach exploits the spatial and temporal correlations between sensors to construct a hierarchical graph index, enabling fast and scalable data retrieval. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that SensorGraph outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 5x in terms of query response time and data freshness.
