Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process and employ a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
