 Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and system scalability. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on rule-based or cost-based approaches, which can be limited in their ability to adapt to changing workloads and system dynamics. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based approach to query optimization, which leverages a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy. Our approach is capable of adapting to changing workloads, handling complex query patterns, and scaling to large distributed database systems. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and system scalability compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
