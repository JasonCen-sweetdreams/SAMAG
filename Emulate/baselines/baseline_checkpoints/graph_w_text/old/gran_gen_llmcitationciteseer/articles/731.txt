This paper presents a novel query-adaptive document expansion approach to improve the efficiency of information retrieval systems. We propose a neural ranking model that learns to adaptively expand documents based on the query context, reducing the dimensionality of the search space while preserving relevant information. Our experiments on the TREC benchmark dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, with an average increase of 15% in recall and 12% in precision, while reducing the query processing time by 30%. We also analyze the robustness of our approach to varying query types and document lengths.
