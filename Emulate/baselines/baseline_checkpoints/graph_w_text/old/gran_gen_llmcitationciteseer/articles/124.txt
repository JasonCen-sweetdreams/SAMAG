Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing methods rely on simplistic feature attribution techniques that fail to capture complex item relationships. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that learns to identify influential items and their interactions in a users' preference graph. Our model incorporates a self-attention mechanism to weigh item importance and a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify higher-order relationships. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN on two real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
