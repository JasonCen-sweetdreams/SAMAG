Semantic search aims to retrieve relevant documents based on the underlying meaning of a query. Query expansion techniques are commonly used to improve search performance, but often rely on simplistic term co-occurrence analysis. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages word embeddings and graph-based methods to identify semantically related terms for query expansion. We introduce a graph convolutional network that incorporates word embeddings, entity relationships, and contextual information to generate a more comprehensive query representation. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search precision and recall over state-of-the-art methods.
