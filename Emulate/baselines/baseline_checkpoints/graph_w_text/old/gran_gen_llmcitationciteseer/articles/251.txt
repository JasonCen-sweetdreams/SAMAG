Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using reinforcement learning, which enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing environments. We introduce a novel multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, 'MAQL', that incorporates a graph-based representation of the task allocation problem. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that MAQL outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
