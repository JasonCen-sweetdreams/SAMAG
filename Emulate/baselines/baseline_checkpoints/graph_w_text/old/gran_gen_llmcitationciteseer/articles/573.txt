Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for many applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework for explainable anomaly detection. Our approach leverages multi-scale attention mechanisms to identify relevant features and contextual relationships in time-series data, enabling the detection of complex anomalies. We evaluate HAN on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach has potential applications in industries such as finance, healthcare, and manufacturing.
