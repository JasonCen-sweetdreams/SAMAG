Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often fail to consider the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EASE', a VR platform tailored to support older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with stakeholders, including older adults, caregivers, and healthcare professionals, to inform the development of EASE. Our user-centered design approach incorporated features such as simplified interfaces, cognitive support tools, and personalized content. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in user experience and engagement compared to a standard VR system.
