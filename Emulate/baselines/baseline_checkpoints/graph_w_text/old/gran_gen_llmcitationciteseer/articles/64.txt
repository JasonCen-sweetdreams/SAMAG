Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, aimed at reformulating the original query to better capture the user's intent. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. We propose a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion, relevance ranking, and semantic matching. Our model, called DeepQE, learns to generate high-quality expansion terms by leveraging large-scale click-through data and contextualized embeddings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, leading to improved retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
