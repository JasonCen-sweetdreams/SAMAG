Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages neural topic models to generate contextualized and semantically rich query representations. Our approach, called NeuroExpand, integrates a transformer-based topic model with a relevance feedback mechanism to adaptively refine query expansions. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
