Query optimization is a critical component of relational databases, but existing methods often struggle with distributed database systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workloads and system configurations. Our approach, 'QRON', learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a distributed relational database benchmark demonstrate that QRON outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2x reduction in resource consumption.
