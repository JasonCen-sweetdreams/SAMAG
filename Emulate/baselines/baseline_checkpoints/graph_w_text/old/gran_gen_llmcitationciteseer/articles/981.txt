Large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) often suffer from entity duplication and inconsistent data, hindering their potential for AI applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical entity resolution (HER) framework, 'KGResolve', which leverages both local and global context to disambiguate entities efficiently. Our approach utilizes a probabilistic graph model to capture entity relationships and a scalable clustering algorithm to group similar entities. Experimental results on several real-world KGs demonstrate that KGResolve achieves higher precision and recall compared to existing entity resolution methods, while reducing the computational overhead by an order of magnitude.
