Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing approaches focus on simplistic feature importance measures. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that incorporates graph-based attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships. Our approach learns to identify influential users and items while generating interpretable explanations for recommended items. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and providing insightful explanations.
