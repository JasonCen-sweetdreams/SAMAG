This paper presents a novel decentralized negotiation mechanism for autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines auction-based and argumentation-based negotiation strategies to facilitate efficient and effective decision-making among agents. Our mechanism is robust to changes in agent preferences and environmental conditions, and we demonstrate its applicability in a simulated smart grid scenario. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing decentralized negotiation methods in terms of solution quality and convergence speed.
