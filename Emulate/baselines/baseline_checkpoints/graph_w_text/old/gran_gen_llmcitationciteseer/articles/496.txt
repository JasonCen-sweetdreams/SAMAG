Optimizing queries in distributed relational databases is a complex problem due to the exponential growth of possible execution plans. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively learn the optimal query plan for a given workload. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', utilizes a Deep Q-Network to explore the vast space of possible plans and converges to near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional optimization methods by up to 3x in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
