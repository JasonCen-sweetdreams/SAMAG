Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability, hindering their adoption in high-stakes applications. We propose Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN) to address this limitation. HAN combines hierarchical feature extraction with attention mechanisms to identify anomalies and attribute them to specific temporal segments and features. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while providing insights into the underlying causes. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability, making it suitable for real-world deployments.
