Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient retrieval of relevant passages from a massive corpus. We propose DPR-KG, a dense passage retrieval model that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Our approach exploits the structural information in the knowledge graph to learn a dense representation of passages, which enables fast nearest-neighbor search. Experiments on popular ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that DPR-KG outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models while reducing computational cost by 30%. We also show that our approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing ODQA pipelines, yielding significant end-to-end performance improvements.
