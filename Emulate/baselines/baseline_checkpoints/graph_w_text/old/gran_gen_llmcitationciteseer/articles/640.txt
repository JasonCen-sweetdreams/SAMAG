Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing interfaces can be inaccessible and overwhelming. This study presents the design and evaluation of 'CARE', a novel VR interface that incorporates cognitive support features and personalized adaptation. We conducted a user study with 20 older adults with mild cognitive impairment, demonstrating significant improvements in task performance and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our findings inform the development of accessible VR systems that cater to the diverse needs of older adults.
