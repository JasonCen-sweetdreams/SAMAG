This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR game using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance user engagement, presence, and enjoyment, as well as reduce cognitive load. We also found that the level of personalization affects user experience, with avatars that closely resemble the user's physical appearance leading to the most positive outcomes. The implications of this research are discussed in the context of VR applications, such as gaming, education, and therapy.
