Optimizing query execution plans in distributed database systems is a complex task, especially in the presence of varying workload patterns and system heterogeneity. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively learn query optimization strategies. We design a customizable environment that simulates various distributed database settings and train an RL agent to select optimal query plans based on latency, resource utilization, and data locality. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource efficiency.
