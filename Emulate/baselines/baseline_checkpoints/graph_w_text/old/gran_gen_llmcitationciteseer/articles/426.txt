Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems often struggle to capture complex semantic relationships between medical entities. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'MedGrapheX', which leverages neural graph collabulation to incorporate domain knowledge from medical ontologies. By jointly learning graph-based entity representations and query-term importance, MedGrapheX improves the retrieval performance of MIR systems. Experiments on the TREC Medical dataset demonstrate significant gains in precision and recall over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
