Coordinating multiple agents in complex environments requires effective communication and decision-making strategies. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable multi-agent cooperation. Our approach integrates graph attention mechanisms to model inter-agent relationships and attention-based feature extraction to focus on relevant environmental cues. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue task demonstrate that HAN outperforms existing methods in terms of task success rate and interpretability of agent decisions.
