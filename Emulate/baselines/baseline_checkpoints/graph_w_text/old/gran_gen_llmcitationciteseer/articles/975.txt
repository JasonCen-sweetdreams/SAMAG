Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable suggestions to users. While graph-based models have shown promising results, they often fail to capture complex relationships between users and items. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant user-item interactions. We demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS models on three real-world datasets, while providing meaningful explanations for recommended items through attention visualization. Our approach has significant implications for trust-aware recommendation systems in e-commerce and online services.
