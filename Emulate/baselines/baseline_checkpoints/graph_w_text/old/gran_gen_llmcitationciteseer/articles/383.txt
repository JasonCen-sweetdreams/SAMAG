Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising medium for immersive experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatar customization on user engagement in VR environments. We designed a VR platform that allows users to create avatars tailored to their physical appearance, personality, and preferences. Our user study with 120 participants reveals that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, measured through self-reported presence, enjoyment, and time spent in the VR environment. We also identify key factors influencing user engagement, including avatar realism, anthropomorphism, and customization options. The findings have implications for VR application design, highlighting the importance of user-centric approaches to enhance user experience.
