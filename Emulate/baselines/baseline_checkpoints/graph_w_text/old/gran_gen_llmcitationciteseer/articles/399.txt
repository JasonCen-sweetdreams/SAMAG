The proliferation of digital documents has necessitated the development of efficient indexing techniques for scalable information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Neural Embeddings (HNE), which leverages neural networks to learn hierarchical representations of documents. HNE enables fast and accurate query processing by exploiting the semantic relationships between documents and their components. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HNE outperforms traditional indexing methods in terms of query throughput and accuracy, while reducing the storage requirements by up to 50%.
