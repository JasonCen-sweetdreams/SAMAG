Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments often face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving user interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our proposed framework incorporates auditory and haptic feedback, 3D audio spatialization, and customizable accessibility settings. We evaluate our approach through a case study on a VR-based educational application, demonstrating improved user experience and task completion rates for visually impaired participants.
