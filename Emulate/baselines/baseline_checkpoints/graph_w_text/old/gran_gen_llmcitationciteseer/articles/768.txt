Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can significantly impact their performance. Existing detection methods often require extensive retraining or fine-tuning, which can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning-based approach, 'TL-AD', that leverages pre-trained DNNs to detect adversarial attacks. We demonstrate that TL-AD can achieve high detection accuracy with minimal additional training data and computational overhead. Experimental results on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show that TL-AD outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods while maintaining the performance of the original DNN.
