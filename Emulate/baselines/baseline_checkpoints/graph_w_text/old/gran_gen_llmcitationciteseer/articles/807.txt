This paper explores the development of autonomous negotiation strategies for multi-agent systems operating in dynamic environments. We propose a novel framework, 'DynaNegotiator', which incorporates real-time environment perception, opponent modeling, and adaptive strategy selection. Our approach enables agents to effectively negotiate and adapt to changing circumstances, achieving improved outcomes in complex, real-world scenarios. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of DynaNegotiator in a variety of dynamic environments, including supply chain management and smart grid optimization.
