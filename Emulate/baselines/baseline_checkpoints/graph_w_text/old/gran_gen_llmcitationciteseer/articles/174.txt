Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict optimal join orders and indexing strategies based on query patterns and data distributions. Experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
