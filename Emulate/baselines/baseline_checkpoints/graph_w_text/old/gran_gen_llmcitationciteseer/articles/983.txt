Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its accessibility remains a significant concern for users with visual impairments. This paper proposes a novel framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. We conducted a series of user studies to identify the key challenges faced by visually impaired users in VR environments and developed a set of guidelines for designing accessible VR interfaces. Our approach leverages audio-based navigation, haptic feedback, and machine learning-driven object recognition to enable visually impaired users to effectively interact with VR systems. Experimental results show that our framework significantly improves the user experience and task performance of visually impaired users in VR environments.
