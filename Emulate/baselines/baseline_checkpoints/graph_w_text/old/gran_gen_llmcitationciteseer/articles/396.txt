In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often involve complex interactions among agents. While deep reinforcement learning has shown promise in solving such problems, it remains challenging to provide interpretability and explainability of the learned policies. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that integrates agent-specific attention mechanisms with a graph-based neural network. HAN enables the identification of influential agents and their relationships, thereby facilitating explainable decision-making. Experimental results on a real-world traffic management scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in improving collaboration and reducing congestion.
