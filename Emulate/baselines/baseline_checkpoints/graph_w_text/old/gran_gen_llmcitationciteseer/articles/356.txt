Distributed database systems are increasingly used to manage large-scale data, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to model complex relationships between database entities. Our method, called 'KGE-Opt', uses a graph neural network to learn embeddings that capture semantic dependencies between tables, columns, and queries. We demonstrate that KGE-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques in terms of query response time and resource utilization on a range of benchmark datasets.
