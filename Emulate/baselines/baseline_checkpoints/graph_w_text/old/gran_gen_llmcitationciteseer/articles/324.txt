Traditional information retrieval (IR) methods often rely on manual feature engineering and simplistic ranking models. We propose a novel hierarchical neural network architecture, 'HiRank', which learns to rank documents in a scalable and efficient manner. HiRank leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to model complex document structures and capture semantic relationships between queries and documents. Experimental results on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate that HiRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models while reducing computational costs by up to 30%.
