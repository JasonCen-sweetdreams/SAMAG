Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but existing input methods can be cumbersome and unnatural. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction system for VR, leveraging deep learning to predict user intentions from eye movements. Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) to accurately detect and classify gaze patterns. We evaluate our system using a custom-built VR environment and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing interaction time and improving user experience compared to traditional input methods.
