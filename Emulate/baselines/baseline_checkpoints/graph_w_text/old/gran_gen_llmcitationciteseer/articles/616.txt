Collaborative filtering is a widely used technique for recommendation systems, but it often struggles with cold start and sparse data issues. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking model that incorporates deep graph convolutional networks (DGCNs) to capture complex user-item relationships. Our approach, 'GraphRank', learns to represent users and items as dense embeddings by propagating information through a user-item graph. We demonstrate that GraphRank outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative filtering methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in ranking accuracy and novelty of recommended items.
