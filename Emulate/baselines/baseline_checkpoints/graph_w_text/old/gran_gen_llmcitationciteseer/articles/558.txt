Multi-tenant database systems require efficient query optimization to ensure high performance and low latency for various workloads. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework that leverages workload-aware partitioning to improve resource utilization and reduce query execution times. Our approach incorporates a probabilistic model to predict workload patterns and dynamically adjusts partitioning strategies to minimize resource contention. Experimental results on a real-world cloud database show that our approach achieves a 30% reduction in query latency and a 25% increase in throughput compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
