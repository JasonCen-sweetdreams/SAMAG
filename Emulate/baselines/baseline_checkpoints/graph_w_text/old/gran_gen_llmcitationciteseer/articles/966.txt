Query optimization is a crucial step in ensuring the performance of distributed database systems. Traditional approaches rely on rule-based or cost-based optimization techniques, which can be suboptimal in complex distributed environments. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workload patterns and system dynamics. Our approach, dubbed 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy from historical query execution data. Experimental results on a simulated distributed database system show that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
