Voice assistants have the potential to improve the lives of older adults, but existing systems often exclude or frustrate this user group. This paper presents a participatory design study involving 20 older adults, which identifies key usability and accessibility issues with current voice assistants. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants, focusing on clear and simple voice prompts, visual feedback, and personalized error handling. Our findings suggest that co-designing with older adults can lead to more effective and empowering voice assistant interfaces, enhancing their overall user experience and promoting digital inclusion.
