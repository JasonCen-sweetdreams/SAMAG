This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, leveraging auction-based mechanisms to efficiently allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Our approach, dubbed 'AuctionAgent', enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and availability, while ensuring fairness and optimality through a novel pricing scheme. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that AuctionAgent outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization.
