 Passage retrieval is a crucial component of many natural language processing applications, including question answering and text summarization. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document representation (QADR) method that learns to selectively weight and combine document segments based on their relevance to the input query. We introduce a neural ranking model that jointly optimizes query-document similarity and passage retrieval, leveraging a novel hierarchical attention mechanism. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QADR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods in terms of both retrieval efficiency and accuracy.
