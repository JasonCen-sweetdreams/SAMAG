This paper introduces HAT-MARL, a novel hierarchical attention framework for explainable multi-agent reinforcement learning. By incorporating attention mechanisms at both the agent and team levels, HAT-MARL enables agents to selectively focus on relevant teammates and tasks, leading to improved coordination and decision-making. We evaluate HAT-MARL on a range of cooperative and competitive environments, demonstrating significant performance gains and providing insights into the learned attention patterns. Our approach has potential applications in real-world domains such as autonomous vehicles and smart grids.
