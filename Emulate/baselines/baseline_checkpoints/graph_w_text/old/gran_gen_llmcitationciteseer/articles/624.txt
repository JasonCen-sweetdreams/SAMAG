Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion, leveraging graph-based embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'GraphEx', represents the query and document terms as nodes in a graph, and uses graph convolutional networks to learn dense representations. We demonstrate that GraphEx outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, such as Rocchio and RM3, on several benchmark datasets, including Robust04 and ClueWeb09. Our approach is particularly effective in retrieving relevant documents for short queries, and can be easily integrated into existing retrieval systems.
