In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agent teams using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach represents the agent-team interaction as a graph, where agents are nodes and edges denote communication links. We employ a GNN to learn the node and edge representations, enabling agents to make local decisions about task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
