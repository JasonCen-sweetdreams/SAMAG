Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but its impact on cognitive processes remains understudied. This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in VR, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed an experiment where participants performed a series of tasks in a VR environment, using either gesture-based or controller-based input modalities. Our results show that gesture-based interaction enhances spatial memory and cognitive load, while reducing perceived mental effort. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR interfaces and the potential benefits of embodied cognition in human-computer interaction.
