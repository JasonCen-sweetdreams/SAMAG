This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent planning in dynamic environments, where agents must adapt to changing conditions and coordinate their actions to achieve complex tasks. We propose a hierarchical task decomposition framework that enables agents to recursively break down tasks into smaller sub-tasks, and allocate them to individual agents or sub-groups. Our approach leverages a probabilistic planning language to model uncertainty and incorporate feedback from the environment. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized planning methods.
