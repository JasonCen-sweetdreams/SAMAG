This paper presents a novel approach to ad-hoc retrieval, where documents are ranked based on their relevance to a given query. We propose a deep neural network architecture that learns query-aware document embeddings, which capture the semantic relationships between queries and documents. Our method, dubbed 'QADE', leverages a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query-document similarity and relevance ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QADE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving significant improvements in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
