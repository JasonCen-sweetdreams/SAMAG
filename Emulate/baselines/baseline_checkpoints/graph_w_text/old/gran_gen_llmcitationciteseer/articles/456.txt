Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when faced with limited labeled data. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning approach, entitled Adaptive Task Embeddings (ATE), which learns to adapt the task embeddings based on the given support set. Our method leverages a learnable task encoder that generates task-specific embeddings, which are then used to condition the base model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ATE on various benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-shot image classification tasks.
