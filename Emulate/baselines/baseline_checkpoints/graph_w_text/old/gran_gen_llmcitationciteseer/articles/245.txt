Distributed database systems (DDS) pose significant challenges in query optimization due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach, 'GraphOpt', which models the query plan space as a graph and leverages graph neural networks to identify optimal query plans. We develop a scalable framework that incorporates data locality awareness, incremental query refinement, and parallelized optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in query execution time and 25% in resource utilization.
