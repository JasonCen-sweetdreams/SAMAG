In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, this problem becomes increasingly complex as the number of agents and tasks grows. We propose a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn agent-task affinities. Our approach enables agents to communicate with their neighbors and make local decisions, eliminating the need for a centralized controller. Experimental results on a range of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional approaches in terms of task completion rate, latency, and adaptability to dynamic environments.
