Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing effective avatars remains a challenging task. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatar expressiveness on user engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, using a novel framework that generates avatars with varying levels of expressiveness based on individual personality traits. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to significant increases in user engagement, measured through self-reported presence, enjoyment, and behavioral metrics. We also identify key expressiveness features that contribute most to user engagement, providing insights for the design of future VR systems.
