Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our RL-based optimizer, called 'DQRO', learns to select the optimal query plan by interacting with the DDS environment and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrate that DQRO outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
