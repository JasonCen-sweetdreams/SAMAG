Few-shot image classification remains a challenging task in machine learning, particularly when dealing with novel classes and limited labeled data. This paper proposes a meta-learning approach that leverages hierarchical attention networks to learn transferable knowledge across tasks. Our method, dubbed 'MetaHAN', adaptively focuses on relevant regions and features at multiple scales, enabling the model to recognize unseen classes with improved accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MetaHAN outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods, achieving up to 10% improvement in classification accuracy.
