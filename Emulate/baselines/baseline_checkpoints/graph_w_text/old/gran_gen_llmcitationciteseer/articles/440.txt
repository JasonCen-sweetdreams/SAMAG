Gesture recognition systems have shown promise in enhancing accessibility for older adults with motor impairments. However, existing systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents 'EasyGesture', a novel gesture recognition framework designed to accommodate the motor limitations and preferences of older adults. Our approach incorporates a participatory design methodology, involving co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers. We develop a machine learning model that adapts to individual motor abilities, leveraging a dataset of gestures collected from a diverse group of older adults. Evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
