In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient coordination among agents to achieve global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation using deep reinforcement learning, which learns a policy to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities and the environment. We propose a hierarchical framework that combines a centralized task allocator with decentralized agent controllers, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a simulated disaster response scenario. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency.
