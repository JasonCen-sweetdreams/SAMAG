Explainable recommendation systems (XRS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable suggestions to users. While graph-based methods have shown promise, they often struggle to capture complex relationships between users and items. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework that integrates hierarchical graph attention mechanisms to model user-item interactions at multiple scales. HGAT leverages attention weights to generate personalized explanations for recommendations, improving user trust and satisfaction. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HGAT over state-of-the-art XRS methods in terms of accuracy, diversity, and explainability.
