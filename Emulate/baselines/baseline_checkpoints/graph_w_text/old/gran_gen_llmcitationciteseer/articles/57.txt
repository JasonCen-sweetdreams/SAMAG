This paper proposes a decentralized trust management framework for autonomous agents, leveraging blockchain technology to establish a reputation system. Our approach enables agents to evaluate and update their trust in peers based on their past interactions, without relying on a central authority. We introduce a novel consensus algorithm that ensures the integrity and transparency of the reputation data, while maintaining scalability and fault tolerance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in promoting trustworthy behavior among agents in a simulated multi-agent system.
