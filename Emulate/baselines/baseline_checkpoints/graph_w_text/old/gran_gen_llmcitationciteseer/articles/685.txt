In many real-world applications, multiple agents must work together to accomplish complex tasks. However, designing effective task allocation mechanisms in such systems is challenging due to the presence of self-interested agents. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to incentivize cooperation among agents. Our approach incorporates a reputation-based mechanism that rewards agents for contributing to the global objective and penalizes those that act selfishly. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive simulations on a resource allocation problem, showcasing improved system performance and fairness compared to existing methods.
