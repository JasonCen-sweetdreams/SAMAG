Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their complexity can create barriers for older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a usability study investigating the design of accessible conversational interfaces for this population. We propose a set of guidelines for simplifying dialogue flows, enhancing feedback mechanisms, and providing cognitive support features. Our findings indicate that these design principles can significantly improve task completion rates and user satisfaction among older adults with cognitive impairments. We also discuss implications for future research on inclusive HCI design.
