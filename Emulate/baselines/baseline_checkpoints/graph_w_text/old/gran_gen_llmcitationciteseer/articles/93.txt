This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We leverage deep reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn optimal task assignments in real-time, without relying on a centralized controller. Our approach incorporates a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a multi-agent deep Q-network to learn decentralized policies. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and adaptability to changing system dynamics.
