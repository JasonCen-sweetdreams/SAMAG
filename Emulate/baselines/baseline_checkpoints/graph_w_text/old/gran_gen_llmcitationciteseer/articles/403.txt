Main-memory databases have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics and transactional workloads. However, existing indexing techniques struggle to efficiently support multi-attribute range queries, which are common in many applications. This paper proposes a novel indexing scheme, 'MAZE', that leverages a combination of bit-encoding, prefix-sum arrays, and optimized query planning to accelerate range queries on multiple attributes. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that MAZE outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 5x in terms of query latency and 3x in terms of memory efficiency.
