Query expansion is a crucial step in improving the effectiveness of ad-hoc retrieval systems. Traditional methods rely on term co-occurrence analysis or manual rule-based approaches, which can be limited by their inability to capture complex semantic relationships. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based query expansion framework, 'DeepQE', which leverages neural networks to learn contextualized term embeddings and generate expanded queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval precision and recall.
