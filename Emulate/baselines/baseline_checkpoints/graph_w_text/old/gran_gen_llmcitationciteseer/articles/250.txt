This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model for efficient document retrieval. Our approach leverages a combination of dense passage retrieval and hierarchical clustering to reduce the search space and improve retrieval efficiency. We experimentally demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks, including the TREC 2004 and ClueWeb09 datasets, while reducing query latency by up to 30%. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the model's performance and show its robustness to varying clustering granularities and document lengths.
