Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of query terms and documents. Our approach, dubbed 'NeuroXPAND', uses a multi-task learning objective to jointly optimize query term embeddings, document ranking, and relevance feedback. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroXPAND outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant gains in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
