Coordinating multiple agents to achieve common goals is a complex task, especially when agents have different expertise and objectives. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable multi-agent cooperation. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their local goals, while a hierarchical structure captures global dependencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN on a variety of multi-agent scenarios, including robotic soccer and disaster response, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of both task completion and interpretability.
