Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems struggle with query latency due to the complexity of indexing and retrieving data from multiple sources. This paper presents a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HierIndex', which reduces query response times by up to 40% in large-scale DIR systems. HierIndex leverages a two-tiered indexing structure, combining a global index with local indexes at each data source. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HierIndex outperforms existing indexing methods, particularly for complex queries involving multiple keywords and Boolean operators.
