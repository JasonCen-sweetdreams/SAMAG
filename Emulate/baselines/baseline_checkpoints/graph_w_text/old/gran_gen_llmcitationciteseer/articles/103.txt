Distributed databases have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and provide high availability. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed databases. Our method, called QOPT-RL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database's current state and the query's characteristics. We evaluate QOPT-RL on a real-world distributed database and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time.
