In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework to improve the explainability and transparency of multi-agent decision-making processes. Our approach combines graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical clustering to identify influential agents and critical interactions. We evaluate the proposed HAN framework on a simulated traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved decision-making performance and enhanced explainability of agent interactions compared to state-of-the-art methods.
