Neural search models have revolutionized information retrieval, but their computational overhead hinders their adoption in real-world applications. This paper proposes an adaptive query segmentation approach, 'AdapSeg', which dynamically partitions complex queries into sub-queries to optimize the search process. By leveraging a novel reinforcement learning-based strategy, AdapSeg learns to identify the most informative sub-queries and allocate computational resources accordingly. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdapSeg achieves significant speedups (up to 3.5x) while maintaining retrieval effectiveness, making neural search more practical for large-scale applications.
