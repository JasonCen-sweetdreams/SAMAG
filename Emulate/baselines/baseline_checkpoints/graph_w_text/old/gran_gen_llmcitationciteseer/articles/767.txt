In distributed databases, index selection plays a crucial role in optimizing query performance. However, existing methods often rely on manual tuning or simplistic heuristics, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to select the most effective indexes for a given query workload. We develop a framework that integrates query analysis, database profiling, and index recommendation using a graph neural network. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by up to 3x in query execution time and 2x in storage efficiency.
