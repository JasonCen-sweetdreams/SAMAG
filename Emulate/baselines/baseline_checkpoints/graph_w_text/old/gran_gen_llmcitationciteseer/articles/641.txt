Effective task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents must coordinate to achieve complex goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'DCAgent', which leverages distributed constraint optimization to allocate tasks to agents in real-time. DCAgent uses a hierarchical graph-based representation to model agent capabilities, task dependencies, and constraints. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that DCAgent outperforms centralized optimization methods in terms of solution quality and scalability, while reducing communication overhead by up to 75%.
