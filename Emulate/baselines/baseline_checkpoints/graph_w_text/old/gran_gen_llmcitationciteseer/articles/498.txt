Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale datasets, but optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to improve query optimization in distributed databases. Our method, called QOptRL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plan based on the database's workload and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that QOptRL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
