Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but seniors often face barriers due to declining speech recognition accuracy. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant tailored to seniors' needs. Our study combines speech recognition experiments with user experience evaluation, revealing that seniors' speech patterns differ significantly from those of younger adults. We propose a set of design guidelines and a novel acoustic model that improves speech recognition accuracy by 23% for seniors. Our findings have implications for the development of accessible voice assistants that cater to the growing senior population.
