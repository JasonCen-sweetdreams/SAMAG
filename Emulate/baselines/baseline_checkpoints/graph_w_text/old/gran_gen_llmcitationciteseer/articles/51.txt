This study explores the effects of personalized avatars on user engagement in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR system using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increased user engagement, measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported enjoyment. We also found that users who created their own avatars exhibited higher levels of agency and presence. The findings have implications for the design of VR systems, suggesting that incorporating personalized avatars can enhance user experience and encourage longer-term engagement.
