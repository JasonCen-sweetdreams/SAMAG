In distributed systems, efficient resource allocation is crucial for optimal performance. This paper presents a novel framework for autonomous agent coordination, enabling agents to negotiate and allocate resources in a decentralized manner. We introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, which combines deep Q-networks with a Graph Attention Network to model complex interactions between agents. Experimental results on a simulated cloud computing environment demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and overall system efficiency compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
