Virtual reality (VR) has immense potential for entertainment, education, and therapy, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience and motivation in VR environments. We designed and implemented a novel avatar creation system, 'AvatarGenie', which uses machine learning-based 3D modeling and user preference analysis. A user study with 120 participants revealed that personalized avatars significantly improved user engagement, presence, and overall satisfaction, particularly for users with high levels of anxiety or self-consciousness. The results have implications for VR-based interventions, training, and social interactions.
