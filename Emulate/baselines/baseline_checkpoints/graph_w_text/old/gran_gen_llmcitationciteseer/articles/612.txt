Emotion recognition in human-computer interaction (HCI) is a crucial task, but existing approaches struggle to effectively fuse and weight multimodal cues from speech, text, and vision. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that adaptively integrates and attends to relevant modalities at multiple levels. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific encoders, hierarchical attention modules, and a fusion layer. Experiments on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multimodal inputs, achieving a 12.5% relative improvement in F1-score.
