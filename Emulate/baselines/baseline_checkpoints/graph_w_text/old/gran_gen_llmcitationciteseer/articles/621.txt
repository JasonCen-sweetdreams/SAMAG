Distributed databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management systems, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL), which learns to adapt to changing workload patterns and database configurations. Our proposed framework, 'RL-Optimizer', employs a deep Q-network to select optimal query plans based on a reward function that balances query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database showcase significant improvements in query performance and resource efficiency compared to traditional optimization techniques.
