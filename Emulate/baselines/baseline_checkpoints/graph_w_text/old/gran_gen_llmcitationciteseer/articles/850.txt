Ad-hoc search engines often struggle to retrieve relevant documents due to the inherent ambiguity of user queries. This paper proposes a novel context-aware document expansion framework that leverages both local and global context to disambiguate query terms and enrich document representations. Our approach incorporates a graph-based method to model document relationships and a neural ranking model to re-rank documents based on their semantic relevance to the query. Experimental results on the TREC 2004 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries with high ambiguity.
