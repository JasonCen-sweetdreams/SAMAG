Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to improve healthcare outcomes by facilitating more effective patient-provider communication. However, existing ECAs often neglect the needs of diverse patient populations. This paper presents an inclusive design framework for ECAs, incorporating insights from human-centered design, social psychology, and healthcare disparities research. We develop and evaluate a proof-of-concept ECA, 'Care Companion', which uses culturally sensitive dialogue management and adaptive nonverbal behavior to promote trust and engagement among patients from underrepresented groups. Our user study demonstrates significant improvements in patient satisfaction and perceived empathy compared to traditional ECA designs.
