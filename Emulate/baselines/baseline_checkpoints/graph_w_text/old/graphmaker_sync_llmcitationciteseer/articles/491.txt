In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that involves assigning tasks to agents based on their capabilities and preferences. This paper proposes a decentralized coalition formation approach, 'DCFA', which enables agents to form coalitions and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. DCFA utilizes a novel graph-based representation of agent capabilities and preferences, and employs a distributed constraint optimization algorithm to find optimal coalition structures. We evaluate DCFA in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating its ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and improve task allocation efficiency compared to centralized approaches.
