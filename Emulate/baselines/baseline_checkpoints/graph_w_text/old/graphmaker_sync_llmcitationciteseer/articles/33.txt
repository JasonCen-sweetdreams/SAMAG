Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization, which leverages the structural properties of the query graph to identify efficient execution plans. We introduce a new cost model that takes into account the communication overhead and data distribution in the system. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces query latency by up to 30% compared to traditional optimization techniques.
