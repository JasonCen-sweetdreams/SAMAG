This paper presents a novel approach for decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Our method, dubbed 'GraphAgent', learns to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, resource availability, and communication constraints. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that GraphAgent outperforms traditional distributed constraint optimization methods, achieving faster convergence and improved solution quality. Our approach has significant implications for real-world applications, such as autonomous warehouses, disaster response, and smart cities.
