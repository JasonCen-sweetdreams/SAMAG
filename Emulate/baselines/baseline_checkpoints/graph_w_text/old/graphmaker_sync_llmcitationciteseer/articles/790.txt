Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant that accommodates the needs of this population. Our study involved 20 participants with mild cognitive impairment, who interacted with a custom-built voice assistant using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms. We identified key design recommendations, including simplified language, personalized feedback, and error tolerance, which improved task completion rates and user satisfaction. Our findings inform the development of more accessible and supportive voice assistants for older adults.
