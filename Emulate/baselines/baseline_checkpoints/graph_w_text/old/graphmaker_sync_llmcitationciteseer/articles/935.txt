Recommender systems face a scalability bottleneck when dealing with large user-item graphs. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant graph neighborhoods. HGAT learns hierarchical representations of users and items by recursively applying graph attention at multiple scales. Our experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of recommendation accuracy and latency, outperforming existing graph-based methods. Furthermore, we show that HGAT can handle graphs with millions of nodes and edges, making it a promising solution for large-scale recommender systems.
