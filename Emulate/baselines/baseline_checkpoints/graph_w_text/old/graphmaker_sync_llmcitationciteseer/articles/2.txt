Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexities of data distribution and network latency. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train an RL agent to learn optimal query execution plans based on system dynamics and query workload. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup show that our RL-based approach achieves significant improvements in query response time and system throughput compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
