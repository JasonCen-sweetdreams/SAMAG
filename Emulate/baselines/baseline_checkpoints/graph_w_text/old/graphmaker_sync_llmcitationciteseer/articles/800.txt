This paper proposes a novel document retrieval framework that leverages hierarchical topic modeling and deep learning techniques. Our approach, called Hierarchical Topic-based Neural Retrieval (HTNR), represents documents as a hierarchical structure of topics, which are learned using a neural variational inference framework. We demonstrate that HTNR outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we show that HTNR can effectively incorporate semantic information from knowledge graphs to further improve retrieval performance.
