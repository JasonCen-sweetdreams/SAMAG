This study investigates the application of embodied cognition principles in gesture-based virtual reality (VR) interfaces. We designed an immersive VR environment where users performed a series of tasks using hand gestures, and their cognitive load, spatial awareness, and task performance were assessed. Our results show that embodied cognition-inspired interfaces significantly reduce cognitive load and improve spatial awareness compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. Furthermore, we found that users' gestures exhibited a higher degree of expressiveness and creativity in the embodied cognition condition. The implications of these findings for HCI and VR interface design are discussed.
