Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to improve the query representation to better match relevant documents. This paper introduces a novel deep neural network-based approach, called DQN-QE, which learns to expand queries by predicting relevant terms from a large vocabulary. We leverage a combination of word embeddings and attention mechanisms to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and candidate expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DQN-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
