Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their lack of interpretability hinders trust and adoption. This paper introduces HATS, a hierarchical attention network that detects anomalies while providing explanations through attention weights. Our approach leverages a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both local and global patterns in time-series data. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HATS in detecting anomalies and providing insightful explanations.
