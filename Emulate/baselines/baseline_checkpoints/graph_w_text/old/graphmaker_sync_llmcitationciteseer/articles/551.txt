Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short and ambiguous queries. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using neural embeddings, which leverages the semantic relationships between words to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our proposed method, called 'EmbedEx', employs a graph neural network to learn a dense representation of the query and its relevant terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmbedEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
