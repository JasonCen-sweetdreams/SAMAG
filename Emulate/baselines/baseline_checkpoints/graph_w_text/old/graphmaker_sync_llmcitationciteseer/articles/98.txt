Entity disambiguation in knowledge graphs is a crucial step for accurate information retrieval. However, the combinatorial explosion of possible entity mentions and their corresponding contexts renders traditional approaches computationally expensive. We propose a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HyQE', which leverages the graph structure to efficiently identify and disambiguate entity mentions. HyQE iteratively expands the query context by navigating the knowledge graph, thereby reducing the search space and improving disambiguation accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and computational efficiency.
