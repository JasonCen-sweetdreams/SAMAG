As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding how users interact with virtual environments is crucial. This study investigates the role of embodied cognition in gesture-based interaction in VR, examining how users' bodily experiences influence their interaction with virtual objects. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR system to track gestures and physiological responses. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly affects gesture accuracy and user experience, with implications for the design of intuitive VR interfaces. We propose a set of guidelines for incorporating embodied cognition principles into VR interaction design, enhancing user engagement and overall VR experience.
