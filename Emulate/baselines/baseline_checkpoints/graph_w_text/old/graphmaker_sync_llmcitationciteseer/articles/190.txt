Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that not only detects anomalies but also provides explanations for its predictions. Our model employs a multi-scale attention mechanism to identify relevant features and time-steps, which helps in localizing anomalies. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both detection performance and explainability.
