Distributed database systems are increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed environments. Our method, 'RL-Opt', learns to predict optimal query plans based on database statistics, query patterns, and system workload. We evaluate RL-Opt on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
