Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various industries, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed and implemented a VR system that generates customized avatars based on users' physical characteristics and preferences. A user study with 120 participants revealed that personalized avatars significantly increased user engagement, Presence, and enjoyment compared to generic avatars. Furthermore, we found that the sense of ownership and self-identification with the avatar played a crucial role in these outcomes. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems in fields such as education, entertainment, and healthcare.
