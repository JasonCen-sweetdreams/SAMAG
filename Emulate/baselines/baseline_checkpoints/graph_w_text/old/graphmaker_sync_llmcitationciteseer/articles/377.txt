Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular in various domains, including education, entertainment, and healthcare. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR environments. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 120 participants, using a customized VR platform that generates avatars based on users' personality traits, preferences, and physical characteristics. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance user engagement, presence, and overall experience. We also identify key factors influencing avatar design and provide guidelines for creating effective personalized avatars in VR.
