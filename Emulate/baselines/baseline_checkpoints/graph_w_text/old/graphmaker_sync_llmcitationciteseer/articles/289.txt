Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to the growing need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture for ERS, which leverages multi-hop graph attention mechanisms to capture complex item relationships and user preferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in generating personalized recommendations with meaningful explanations, outperforming state-of-the-art ERS models on several benchmark datasets.
