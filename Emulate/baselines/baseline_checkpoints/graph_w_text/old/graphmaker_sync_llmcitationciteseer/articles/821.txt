Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interaction modalities often exclude users with disabilities. This paper presents an inclusive voice assistant framework that incorporates multimodal interaction, including gesture recognition, text-to-speech, and tactile feedback. We conducted a user study with 30 participants with diverse disabilities, revealing significant improvements in accessibility and user satisfaction. Our framework also includes a novel error correction mechanism that adapts to individual user needs. The results inform the design of more inclusive voice assistants that cater to a broader range of users.
