Existing retrieval models often struggle in low-resource domains, where the scarcity of relevant documents hinders their ability to learn effective representations. We propose a novel query-driven document expansion approach, dubbed QDE, which selectively incorporates pseudo-relevant documents into the training process. By leveraging query-dependent relevance signals, QDE adaptively expands the document set, enriching the model's understanding of the query context. Our experiments on several low-resource benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, with QDE outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
