Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-Opt', which leverages reinforcement learning to efficiently explore the query optimization space. RL-Opt uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy, taking into account various factors such as data distribution, network latency, and resource availability. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average improvement of 30% in query execution time.
