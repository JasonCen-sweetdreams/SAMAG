In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach utilizes a graph neural network to learn agent-agent interactions and a hierarchical policy to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
