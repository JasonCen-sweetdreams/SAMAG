In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem, especially when agents have varying capabilities and tasks have diverse requirements. This paper presents a novel distributed coalition formation approach, 'DCFA', which allows agents to self-organize into coalitions to execute tasks efficiently. DCFA employs a decentralized brokerage mechanism that leverages agent preferences and task constraints to form coalitions. We demonstrate through simulations that DCFA outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate, coalition stability, and communication overhead. The proposed approach has significant implications for real-world applications, such as disaster response and smart manufacturing.
