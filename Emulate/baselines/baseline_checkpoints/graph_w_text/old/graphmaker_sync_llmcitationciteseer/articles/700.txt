Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and provide high performance. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, called 'Distributed Graph Index' (DGI), which efficiently optimizes queries in distributed database systems. DGI leverages graph theory to model the relationships between data fragments and query patterns, enabling the system to prune unnecessary data accesses and reduce query latency. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DGI outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
