Explainability is crucial in multi-agent systems, where decision-making processes involve complex interactions among agents. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) framework for explainable multi-agent decision making. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, generating interpretable explanations for decision outcomes. We evaluate HAN on a real-world traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved decision accuracy and enhanced explainability compared to existing methods.
