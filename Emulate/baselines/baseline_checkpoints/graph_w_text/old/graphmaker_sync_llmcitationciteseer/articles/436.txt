Domain-specific search engines require precise query understanding to retrieve relevant documents. We propose a novel query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', that leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. By incorporating domain knowledge into the embedding space, NeuroQE generates more informative expansion terms, leading to improved retrieval performance. Our experiments on a biomedical search dataset demonstrate significant gains in mean average precision and NDCG over traditional keyword-based expansion methods.
