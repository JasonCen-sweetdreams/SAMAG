Virtual assistants (VAs) have become ubiquitous, but their increasing autonomy raises concerns about user trust. This study investigates the effect of anthropomorphic design on user trust in VAs. We conducted a between-subjects experiment with 120 participants, exposing them to either an anthropomorphized or non-anthropomorphized VA. Results show that anthropomorphic design significantly increases user trust, particularly among users with low prior experience with VAs. However, we also found that users' trust diminishes when the VA makes mistakes, regardless of design. Our findings have implications for the design of trustworthy VAs and highlight the need for more nuanced understanding of human-VAs interactions.
