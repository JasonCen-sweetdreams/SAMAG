Virtual Reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize entertainment, education, and healthcare. However, users with visual impairments often face barriers to accessing VR experiences. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework that incorporates auditory and haptic feedback to enable users with visual impairments to interact with virtual objects. We evaluated our framework through a user study with 20 participants and found significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-based interfaces.
