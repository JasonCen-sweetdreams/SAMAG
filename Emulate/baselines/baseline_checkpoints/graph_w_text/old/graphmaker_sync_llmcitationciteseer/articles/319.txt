Autonomous negotiation is a crucial aspect of multi-agent systems, where agents need to negotiate with each other to reach mutually beneficial agreements. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, dubbed 'AgentNegotiator', that enables agents to learn effective negotiation strategies in complex, dynamic environments. Our approach leverages a hybrid architecture combining graph neural networks and deep Q-networks to model the negotiation process. Experimental results on a range of negotiation scenarios demonstrate that AgentNegotiator outperforms existing negotiation strategies, achieving higher agreement rates and improved social welfare.
