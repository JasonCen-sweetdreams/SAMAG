Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph query languages and the distributed nature of the data. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train an agent to learn an optimal query plan for a given graph query. Our experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
