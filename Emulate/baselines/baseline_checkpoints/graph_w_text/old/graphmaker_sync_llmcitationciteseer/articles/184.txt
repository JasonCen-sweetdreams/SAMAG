Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the lives of people with disabilities, but existing VR systems often neglect accessibility considerations. This paper presents 'AccessibleVR', a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to individuals with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conduct a comprehensive user study to identify key accessibility barriers and develop a set of guidelines for VR designers. Our evaluation demonstrates that AccessibleVR improves user engagement, satisfaction, and overall VR experience for participants with disabilities.
