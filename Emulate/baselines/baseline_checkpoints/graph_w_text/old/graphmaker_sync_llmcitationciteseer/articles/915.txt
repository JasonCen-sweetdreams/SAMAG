This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, SNRM, for efficient document retrieval in information retrieval systems. SNRM leverages semantic embeddings to capture complex relationships between query terms and document contents. We propose a two-stage ranking approach, where a coarse-grained ranking model filters out irrelevant documents, followed by a fine-grained ranking model that refines the ranking using semantic embeddings. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and ClueWeb09 datasets demonstrate that SNRM outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
