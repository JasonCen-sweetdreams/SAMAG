Real-time data warehouses require efficient query optimization to support rapid decision-making. Existing approaches often rely on heuristics or manual tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper presents 'QRex', a deep reinforcement learning framework that adaptively optimizes query plans for real-time data warehouses. QRex learns to navigate the complex space of possible query plans, leveraging a novel reward function that balances query latency, resource utilization, and data freshness. Our experiments on a real-world data warehouse demonstrate that QRex outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time while maintaining high resource efficiency.
