Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but their design often neglects the needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents a mixed-methods study on the user experience of voice assistants among individuals with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive impairments. We identify key usability issues and propose a set of accessibility guidelines for designing inclusive voice assistants. Our results show that users with disabilities face significant barriers in using voice assistants, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidelines through a prototype implementation.
