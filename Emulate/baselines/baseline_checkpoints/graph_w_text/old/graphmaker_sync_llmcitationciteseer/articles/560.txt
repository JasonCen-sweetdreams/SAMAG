Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a critical challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a VR game. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, measured by time spent playing and self-reported enjoyment. We also found that personalized avatars led to increased social presence and reduced feelings of embarrassment. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to enhance user experience and foster social interaction.
