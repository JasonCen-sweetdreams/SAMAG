In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our approach, called DRL-TA, enables agents to learn optimal task assignment policies in a distributed manner, without relying on a centralized controller. We employ a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture that combines both local and global reward functions to optimize task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms existing decentralized approaches in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
