In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework, 'RL-ATAL', which leverages reinforcement learning to enable autonomous agents to adaptively allocate tasks in dynamic environments. RL-ATAL uses a novel, graph-based reward function that incorporates agent capabilities, task priorities, and inter-agent dependencies. Our experimental results demonstrate that RL-ATAL outperforms traditional, centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and system robustness.
