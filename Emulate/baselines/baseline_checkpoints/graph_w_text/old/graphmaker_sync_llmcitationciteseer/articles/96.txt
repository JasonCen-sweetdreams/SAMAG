Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current VR systems often exclude users with disabilities. This paper presents an inclusive VR framework that integrates user-centered design principles with accessibility features. We conducted co-design workshops with users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities to identify key barriers and opportunities. Our framework incorporates real-time gaze-based interaction, audio descriptions, and adaptable difficulty levels to ensure equal access to immersive experiences. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates significant improvements in usability, enjoyment, and sense of presence for users with disabilities.
