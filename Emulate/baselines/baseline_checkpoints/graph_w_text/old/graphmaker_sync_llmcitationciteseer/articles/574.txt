Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it significantly impacts performance and scalability. Traditional query optimizers rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which may not adapt well to dynamic workloads and changing data distributions. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-Optimizer', which leverages reinforcement learning to learn optimal query plans. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn a policy that maximizes performance while minimizing resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource efficiency.
