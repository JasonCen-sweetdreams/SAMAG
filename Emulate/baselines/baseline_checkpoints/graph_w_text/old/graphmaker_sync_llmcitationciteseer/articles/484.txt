E-commerce search engines struggle to retrieve relevant items due to the semantic gap between user queries and product descriptions. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion framework, 'CAQE', which leverages multimodal features from product images and user reviews to enhance retrieval performance. CAQE incorporates a graph-based attention mechanism to model the relationships between query terms, product attributes, and visual features. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain compared to state-of-the-art retrieval models.
