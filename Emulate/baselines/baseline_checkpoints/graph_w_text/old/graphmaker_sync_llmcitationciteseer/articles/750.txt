This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to improve learning outcomes in educational settings. We designed a gestural interface that leverages users' bodily experiences to enhance their understanding of complex concepts in physics and mathematics. Our user study involving 60 participants demonstrates that the embodied cognition-based interface significantly outperforms traditional keyboard-and-mouse interactions in terms of knowledge retention and problem-solving abilities. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of more effective and engaging VR-based educational systems.
