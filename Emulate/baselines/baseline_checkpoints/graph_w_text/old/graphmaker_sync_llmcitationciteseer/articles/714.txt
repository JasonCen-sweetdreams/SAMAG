Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and facial expressions, is a challenging task due to the heterogeneity and complexity of human emotions. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that leverages the strengths of each modality to recognize emotions in a more accurate and explainable manner. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention modules that adaptively weigh the importance of each modality and a hierarchical fusion module that integrates the modality-specific features. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and SEMAINE datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in emotion recognition accuracy and provides interpretable attention weights for emotion attribution.
