Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction in virtual reality (VR). However, designing ECAs that can effectively engage users remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel framework for creating ECAs that incorporate nonverbal cues, such as gestures and facial expressions, to enhance user engagement in VR. We conducted a user study to evaluate the impact of our ECA design on user experience and found that participants reported higher levels of presence, engagement, and social connection with the ECA compared to a text-based interface. Our results have implications for the development of ECAs in VR for applications such as education, entertainment, and therapy.
