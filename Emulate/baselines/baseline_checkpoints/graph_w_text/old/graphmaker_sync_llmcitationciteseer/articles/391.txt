Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent in various aspects of daily life, but their accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of this user group. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies to identify key design principles and guidelines for accessible conversational interfaces. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and multimodal feedback in facilitating engagement and reducing confusion. We also propose a novel cognitive load measurement framework to evaluate the usability of conversational interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments.
