Natural language search (NLS) has become increasingly popular, but existing systems suffer from limited query understanding and low recall. We propose a novel neural query expansion (NQE) framework that leverages pre-trained language models to generate semantic query variants. Our approach combines a query encoder with a generative module to produce a set of expanded queries, which are then ranked based on their semantic similarity to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving an average improvement of 23.5% in terms of mean average precision.
