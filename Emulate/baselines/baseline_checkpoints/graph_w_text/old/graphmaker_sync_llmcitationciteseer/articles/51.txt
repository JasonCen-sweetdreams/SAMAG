Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, where the goal is to expand the original query to better capture the user's information need. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'DeepQE', which learns to generate effective query expansions in an end-to-end manner. Our model leverages a combination of word embeddings and relevance feedback to predict the most relevant expansion terms. Experimental results on several standard TREC datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
