Decentralized task allocation is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. We introduce a decentralized actor-critic algorithm that enables agents to learn cooperative policies and allocate tasks efficiently. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
