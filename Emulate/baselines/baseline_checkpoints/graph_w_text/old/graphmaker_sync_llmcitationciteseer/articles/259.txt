Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a challenging task, particularly in distributed settings. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called 'RL-QOpt', learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution times. We evaluate RL-QOpt on a distributed database cluster and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance compared to traditional optimization techniques. Our results show that RL-QOpt can adapt to changing workloads and is robust to variations in database configurations.
