In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). Our approach leverages a two-level hierarchy, where high-level agents learn to allocate tasks and low-level agents learn to execute tasks using deep Q-networks. We introduce a novel reward function that encourages cooperation and fairness among agents. Experimental results on a simulated robot swarm demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of task completion time and agent satisfaction.
