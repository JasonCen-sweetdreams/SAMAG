Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in smart homes, but their usability and accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remain limited. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyVoice', a voice assistant tailored to the needs of this population. We employed a participatory design approach, involving older adults with cognitive impairments and their caregivers in the design process. EasyVoice incorporates simplifications to the dialogue flow, visual and auditory cues, and personalized adaptation to individual cognitive abilities. Our user study with 20 participants showed significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to a commercial voice assistant.
