Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, most existing methods lack transparency and interpretability, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates explainable attention mechanisms to identify anomalies in multivariate time-series data. Our approach leverages self-attention to model complex temporal relationships and hierarchical attention to identify the most relevant features contributing to anomaly detection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while providing insightful feature importance scores.
