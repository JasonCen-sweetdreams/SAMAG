Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants, have become increasingly prevalent in daily life. However, older adults often face barriers in using these systems, including cognitive, motor, and sensory impairments. This paper presents a participatory design approach to developing conversational interfaces that are more inclusive and accessible for older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, resulting in the development of a novel interface prototype that incorporates multimodal input, error tolerance, and personalized feedback. Our evaluation shows that the designed interface significantly improves the usability and user experience for older adults, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in HCI.
