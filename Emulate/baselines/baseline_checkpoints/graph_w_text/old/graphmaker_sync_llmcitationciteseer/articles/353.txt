In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel distributed constraint optimization approach for scalable task allocation, which leverages a hybrid framework combining local search and constraint propagation. Our method, 'MA-DCOP', enables agents to iteratively refine their task assignments based on local constraints and limited communication with neighbors. Experimental results on a real-world robot swarm simulation demonstrate that MA-DCOP outperforms existing centralized and decentralized approaches in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
