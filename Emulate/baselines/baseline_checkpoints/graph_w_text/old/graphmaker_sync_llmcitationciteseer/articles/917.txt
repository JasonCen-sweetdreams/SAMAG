Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but its effectiveness is often hindered by the ambiguity of user queries. We propose a novel QE approach that leverages context-aware embeddings to capture the nuances of query intent. Our method, called CAQE, generates embeddings that integrate both lexical and semantic features, enabling the retrieval model to better distinguish between relevant and irrelevant terms. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art QE techniques, leading to improved retrieval performance and enhanced user experience.
