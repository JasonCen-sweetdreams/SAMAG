Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict the optimal join order and indexing strategy for a given query, taking into account the underlying system architecture and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and scalability compared to traditional optimization techniques.
