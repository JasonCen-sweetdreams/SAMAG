Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their benefits often exclude older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing inclusive voice assistants that cater to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify design requirements and guidelines for improving accessibility and usability. Our findings highlight the importance of simplifying language input, providing visual feedback, and incorporating assistive features such as cognitive support and memory aids. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept prototype, VoiceCare, which shows promising results in enhancing user experience and independence for older adults with cognitive impairments.
