Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can significantly improve healthcare outcomes by providing accurate diagnoses and treatment plans. Recently, AI-driven CDSSs have gained popularity, but their lack of explainability hinders trust and adoption. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that integrates graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to provide interpretable AI-driven CDSSs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on a large-scale electronic health record dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis while providing transparent reasoning behind the predictions.
