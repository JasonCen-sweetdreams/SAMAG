This paper presents an investigation into the design of accessible gesture recognition systems for individuals with motor impairments. We conducted a user-centered study with 20 participants to identify the challenges and limitations of existing gesture recognition systems. Based on our findings, we developed a novel gesture recognition framework that incorporates personalized machine learning models and adaptive thresholding. Our results show that our system achieves an average accuracy improvement of 23.1% compared to existing systems, particularly for individuals with severe motor impairments. We provide guidelines and recommendations for designing accessible gesture recognition systems that can be integrated into various applications, including gaming, healthcare, and assistive technology.
