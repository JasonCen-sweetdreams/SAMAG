Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the underlying causes of anomalies. This paper introduces HATS, a hierarchical attention network that incorporates both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to detect anomalies in multivariate time-series data. HATS learns to focus on relevant features and time intervals, providing explainable anomaly detection. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HATS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and improves interpretability.
