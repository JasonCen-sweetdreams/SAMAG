Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it aims to reformulate the original query to better capture the user's intent. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'NeuroExp', which leverages the strengths of neural networks to learn effective query expansion strategies. NeuroExp uses a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query representation, term weighting, and relevance ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExp outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
