Optimizing query execution in distributed database systems is a complex task due to the numerous possible query plans and varying system conditions. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans. We design a deep RL framework that learns to predict optimal query plans based on query characteristics, system workload, and performance metrics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
