Traditional keyword-based indexing methods in document retrieval systems suffer from semantic ambiguity and limited context awareness. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph-based semantic indexing approach, dubbed 'SemGraph', which leverages graph neural networks to model document semantics. SemGraph constructs a hierarchical graph representation of documents, capturing both local and global semantic relationships. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that SemGraph outperforms state-of-the-art keyword-based and neural-based indexing methods in terms of retrieval precision and recall.
