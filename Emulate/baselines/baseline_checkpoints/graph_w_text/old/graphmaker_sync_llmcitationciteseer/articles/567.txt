Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but their performance can be limited by the quality of the input queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages hierarchical document embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between queries and documents. Our method, Hierarchical Query Expansion (HQE), represents documents as hierarchical clusters of semantic concepts, allowing for more effective query expansion and retrieval. Experimental results on the TREC-2019 benchmark dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance over state-of-the-art baselines.
