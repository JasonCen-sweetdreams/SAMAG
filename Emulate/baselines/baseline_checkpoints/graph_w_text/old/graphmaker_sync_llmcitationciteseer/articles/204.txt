Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel context-aware embedding-based approach for query expansion, which leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and their surrounding context. Our method, called CAQE, incorporates a graph-based neural network to learn context-dependent representations of query terms, and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval performance on several benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly for queries with ambiguous or nuanced intent.
