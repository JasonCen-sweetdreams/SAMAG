The increasing penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources in smart grids necessitates efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARL-Grid', which enables cooperative decision-making among distributed agents representing different grid components. By leveraging a decentralized, parallelized architecture and a custom-designed reward function, MARL-Grid achieves improved resource allocation efficiency and reduced energy losses compared to traditional optimization methods. Simulation results on a realistic grid topology demonstrate the scalability and adaptability of our approach in response to varying demand and supply conditions.
