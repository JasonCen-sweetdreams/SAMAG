Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but users with dysarthria, a speech disorder characterized by poor articulation, struggle to interact with these systems. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'AccessibleVoice', a novel voice assistant interface tailored to users with dysarthria. We employed participatory design methods, involving users with dysarthria in the design process, to develop a set of adaptive acoustic models and error-tolerant language processing algorithms. A user study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants. Our results inform the development of more inclusive voice interfaces that can benefit individuals with speech disabilities.
