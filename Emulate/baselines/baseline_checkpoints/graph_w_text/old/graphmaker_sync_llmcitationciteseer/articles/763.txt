In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to learn effective allocation strategies. We propose a novel algorithm, 'MA-RL', which enables agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing task demands and environmental conditions. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse scenario demonstrate that MA-RL outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
