Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based systems, which often fail to adapt to dynamic workloads and changing database schemas. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. Our method, called 'DRL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query optimization, taking into account various performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that DRL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
