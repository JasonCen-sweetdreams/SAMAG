Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely on query expansion to improve retrieval performance. Traditional query expansion methods, such as pseudo-relevance feedback, often suffer from noise and limited contextual understanding. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages neural networks to learn semantic query representations and generate context-aware expansion terms. We demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
