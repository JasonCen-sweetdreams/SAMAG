Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for older adults remains a significant concern. This paper presents a multimodal approach to designing conversational systems that cater to the diverse needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, combining usability testing, interviews, and surveys to identify accessibility challenges and preferences. Our findings inform the development of a novel framework, 'AccessibleChat', which incorporates adaptive speech recognition, visual and tactile feedback, and personalized conversational flows. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AccessibleChat in improving interaction outcomes and user satisfaction among older adults.
