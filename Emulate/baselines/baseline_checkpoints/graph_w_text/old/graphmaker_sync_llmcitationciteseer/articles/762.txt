Proximity search is a fundamental operation in many applications, including recommender systems, image search, and plagiarism detection. However, existing methods often struggle with high-dimensional data, leading to slow query response times. This paper presents a novel approach, 'QuickSig', which leverages query-adaptive signature selection to accelerate proximity search. By dynamically adjusting the signature length and indexing scheme based on query characteristics, QuickSig achieves a significant reduction in search latency and memory usage. Experimental results on several high-dimensional datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of QuickSig in improving search efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.
