Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on manually crafted rules or shallow learning techniques. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture, 'DeepQE', which learns to expand queries by modeling semantic relationships between terms. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both local and global contextual information, enabling more effective query representation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving higher precision and recall at top-ranked documents.
