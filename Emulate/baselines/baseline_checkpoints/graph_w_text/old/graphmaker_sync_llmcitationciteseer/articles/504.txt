Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their interaction design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a multimodal interaction study investigating the usability of voice assistants among older adults. We designed and evaluated an inclusive voice assistant prototype incorporating visual and tactile feedback, and assessed its effectiveness in reducing cognitive load and improving task completion rates. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating user-centered design principles and suggest guidelines for designing accessible voice assistants for older adults.
