High-dimensional data indexing is a critical component in many database applications, including similarity search and clustering. This paper presents a novel indexing technique based on hierarchical Voronoi diagrams, which achieves scalable and efficient query performance even for very high-dimensional data sets. Our approach leverages the properties of Voronoi diagrams to prune the search space and reduce the number of distance computations required. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing indexing techniques in terms of query time and storage requirements, making it suitable for large-scale data analytics applications.
