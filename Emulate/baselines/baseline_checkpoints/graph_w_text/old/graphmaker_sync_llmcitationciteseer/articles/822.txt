The increasing popularity of RDF graph databases has led to a surge in the need for efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents 'RDF-QO', a novel query optimization framework specifically designed for distributed RDF graph databases. RDF-QO leverages a combination of statistical graph analysis and machine learning-based cost estimation to identify the most efficient query execution plans. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale RDF dataset demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing query optimization techniques, with an average reduction in query execution time of 35%.
