The increasing adoption of augmented reality (AR) in industrial maintenance has highlighted the need for intuitive and efficient human-computer interaction methods. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a novel gesture-based interface for AR-assisted maintenance tasks. Our system, ' GestureAR', utilizes a combination of computer vision and machine learning to recognize and interpret maintenance workers' gestures, allowing them to interact with virtual objects and receive real-time guidance. A user study with 20 industrial maintenance professionals demonstrates significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional touchscreen-based interfaces.
