Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize social interactions, but existing VR systems often neglect the needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to designing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) that facilitate inclusive VR experiences. We propose an ECA framework that incorporates multimodal input processing, emotional intelligence, and personalized avatars to enhance social presence and accessibility. Our user study with participants with visual and hearing impairments demonstrates significant improvements in engagement, comfort, and perceived social support compared to traditional VR interfaces.
