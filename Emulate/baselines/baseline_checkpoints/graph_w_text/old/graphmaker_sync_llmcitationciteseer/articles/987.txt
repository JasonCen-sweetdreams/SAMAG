In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that affects overall performance and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework using deep reinforcement learning. We model the task allocation problem as a decentralized Markov decision process and develop a multi-agent Q-network (MAQN) that learns to allocate tasks based on agent capabilities, task priorities, and environmental constraints. Experimental results on a simulated urban search and rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods and achieves near-optimal performance in dynamic environments.
