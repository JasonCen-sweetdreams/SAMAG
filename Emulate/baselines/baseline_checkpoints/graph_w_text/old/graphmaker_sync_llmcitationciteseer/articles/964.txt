Online anomaly detection is a crucial task in many applications, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, existing methods often struggle with high-dimensional data and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), which leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between data points. Our approach consists of a hierarchical framework that aggregates features from local to global levels, enabling efficient processing of large-scale data streams. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in detecting anomalies in real-time, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
