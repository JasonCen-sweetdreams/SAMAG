This paper presents a novel gestural interface framework designed specifically for older adults with motor impairments. Our approach leverages computer vision and machine learning to recognize and interpret intentional gestures, and incorporates haptic feedback to assist users with motor control difficulties. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, finding that our system significantly improved gesture recognition accuracy and reduced user fatigue compared to existing gestural interfaces. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and accessible interaction designs for older adults with motor impairments.
