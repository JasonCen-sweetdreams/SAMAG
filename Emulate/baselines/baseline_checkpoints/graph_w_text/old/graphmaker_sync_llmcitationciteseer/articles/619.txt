In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents to maximize efficiency and minimize conflicts. This paper addresses the task allocation problem for cooperative agents with temporal logic constraints. We propose a distributed algorithm that leverages model checking techniques to ensure that the allocated tasks satisfy the desired temporal properties. Our approach is decentralized, fault-tolerant, and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale multi-agent systems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in various scenarios, including robotic teams and sensor networks.
