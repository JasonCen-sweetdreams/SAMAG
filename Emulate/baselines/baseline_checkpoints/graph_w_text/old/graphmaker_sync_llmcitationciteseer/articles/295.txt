Efficient task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and constraints must collaborate to accomplish complex goals. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task allocation framework that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn agent-agent and agent-task relationships. Our approach, called HTA-GCN, represents the agent system as a hierarchical graph and uses GCNs to propagate information between agents and tasks. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that HTA-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and system adaptability to changes in agent availability.
