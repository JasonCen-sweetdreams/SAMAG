Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have garnered significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture for ERS, which leverages both user-item interactions and item attributes to provide personalized explanations. Our model consists of a graph attention encoder that captures complex relationships between items, and a hierarchical decoder that generates natural language explanations. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
