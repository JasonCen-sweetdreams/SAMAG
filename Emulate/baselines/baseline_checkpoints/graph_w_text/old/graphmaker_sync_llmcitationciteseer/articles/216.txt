Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed a study with 120 participants using a customized VR platform that generates avatars based on users' physical characteristics and preferences. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported satisfaction. Furthermore, we found that avatar personalization has a more pronounced impact on users with lower self-efficacy in VR. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to improve user experience and adoption.
