Multi-agent systems (MAS) have become increasingly popular in various applications, such as robotics, smart grids, and traffic management. However, task allocation in heterogeneous MAS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of agent interactions and diverse task requirements. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in real-time. We design a novel neural network architecture that incorporates agent-specific features, task properties, and environmental constraints to learn effective allocation policies. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate the scalability and adaptability of our approach, outperforming traditional optimization methods and centralized allocation schemes.
