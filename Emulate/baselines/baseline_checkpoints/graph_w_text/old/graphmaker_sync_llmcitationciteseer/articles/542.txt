Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, where the goal is to predict the labels of nodes based on their attributes and graph topology. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAT-GNN) that captures complex node relationships by learning attention weights at multiple scales. Our approach leverages a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group nodes into clusters, which are then fed into a graph attention network to learn node representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAT-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of node classification accuracy and robustness to graph perturbations.
