This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). We formulate the task allocation problem as a graph optimization problem, where agents and tasks are represented as nodes, and edges denote communication and task dependencies. Our proposed GNN-based algorithm, called GraphTask, learns to allocate tasks to agents in a decentralized manner, without requiring a centralized controller. We evaluate GraphTask on several benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing communication overhead and improving task allocation efficiency compared to traditional methods.
