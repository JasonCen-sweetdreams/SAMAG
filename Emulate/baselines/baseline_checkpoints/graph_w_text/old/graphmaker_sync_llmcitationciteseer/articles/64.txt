Object detection is a critical component in autonomous vehicle systems, but existing approaches often suffer from high computational complexity and limited contextual understanding. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for efficient object detection in autonomous vehicles. Our HAN model leverages a pyramid feature representation to capture objects at varying scales, and incorporates a self-attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant regions of interest. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant reductions in computational resources and latency.
