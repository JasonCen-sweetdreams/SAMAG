In multi-agent systems, negotiation is a crucial component for achieving cooperation and resolving conflicts. This paper investigates asynchronous negotiation strategies for resource-constrained environments, where agents have limited communication bandwidth and processing power. We propose a novel negotiation protocol, 'AsyncNegotiate', which leverages probabilistic graphical models to reason about the uncertainty of agent preferences and resource availability. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate that AsyncNegotiate outperforms existing synchronous protocols in terms of negotiation efficiency, resource utilization, and overall system stability.
