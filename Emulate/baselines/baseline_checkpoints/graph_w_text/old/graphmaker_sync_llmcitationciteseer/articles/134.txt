Human-robot collaboration (HRC) in virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize industries such as manufacturing and healthcare. However, the role of embodied cognition in HRC remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining how embodied cognition influences human trust, comfort, and task performance in VR-based HRC. Our results show that participants who experienced embodied cognition through full-body avatars exhibited higher trust and comfort levels, as well as improved task performance, compared to those using traditional desktop interfaces. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of future HRC systems.
