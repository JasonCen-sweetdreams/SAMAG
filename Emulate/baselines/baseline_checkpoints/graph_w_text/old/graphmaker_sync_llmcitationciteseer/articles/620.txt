Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, but their performance can be further improved by incorporating query expansion techniques. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using pseudo-relevance feedback, which leverages the neural model's own uncertainty estimates to select the most informative terms for expansion. We demonstrate that our approach, termed 'NuQE', can significantly improve the retrieval performance of neural models on several benchmark datasets, while reducing the computational overhead associated with traditional pseudo-relevance feedback methods.
