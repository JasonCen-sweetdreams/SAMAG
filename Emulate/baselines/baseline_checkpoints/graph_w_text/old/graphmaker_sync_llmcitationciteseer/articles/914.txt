This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation approach for multi-agent systems, leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize task assignment and execution. We propose a hierarchical framework, where agents learn to negotiate and allocate tasks based on their capabilities, resources, and environmental constraints. Our approach enables adaptability, scalability, and robustness in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and system efficiency compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
