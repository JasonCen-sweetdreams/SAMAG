Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with visual impairments, but current VR interfaces often fail to accommodate their needs. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'AccessibleVR', a novel VR interface that incorporates audio, tactile, and visual cues to facilitate navigation and interaction. Our user study with 20 older adults with visual impairments demonstrates that AccessibleVR significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. We also identify key design guidelines for creating inclusive VR experiences for this population.
