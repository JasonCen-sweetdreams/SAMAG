As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly popular, understanding user engagement in VR games is crucial. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and behavior. We designed an experiment where participants played a VR game with either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, improved game performance, and higher self-reported enjoyment. We also found that users with personalized avatars exhibited more prosocial behavior, such as helping others and collaborating with teammates. These findings have implications for VR game design and suggest that incorporating personalized avatars can enhance user experience and social interactions in virtual environments.
