This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach for efficient document retrieval in large-scale collections. HQE leverages a two-stage framework, where a coarse-grained query expansion is performed using a neural topic model, followed by a fine-grained expansion using a graph-based semantic relatedness measure. Our experiments on the TREC-8 benchmark dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision, while reducing the computational overhead by up to 40%. The proposed approach is particularly useful for retrieval systems handling massive document collections.
