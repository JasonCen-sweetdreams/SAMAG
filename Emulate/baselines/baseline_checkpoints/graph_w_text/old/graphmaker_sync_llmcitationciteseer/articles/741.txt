Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it aims to enrich the original query to better capture user intent. In this paper, we propose a novel neural query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between terms. Our approach combines a term-embedding layer with a graph-based attention mechanism to generate expanded queries that are both relevant and diverse. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE achieves significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion techniques, while also being computationally efficient.
