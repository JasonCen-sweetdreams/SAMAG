Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and learning outcomes in VR-based learning environments. We designed and implemented a novel avatar customization system, which allows users to create personalized avatars that reflect their physical appearance and personality traits. A user study with 120 participants revealed that personalized avatars significantly enhance user engagement, motivation, and overall learning experience. Furthermore, our results show that personalized avatars can reduce cognitive load and improve knowledge retention.
