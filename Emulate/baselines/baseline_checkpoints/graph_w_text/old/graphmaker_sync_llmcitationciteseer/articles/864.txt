In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages evolutionary game theory to model agent interactions. Our approach, 'EvoTask', adaptively adjusts task assignments based on agent capabilities, task priorities, and environmental dynamics. We demonstrate the efficacy of EvoTask through extensive simulations, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art decentralized allocation methods.
