Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but users with dyslexia often struggle to engage with these systems due to difficulties with reading and writing. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible conversational interfaces that incorporate assistive technologies to support users with dyslexia. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed framework, 'DysConverse', incorporates multimodal input and output, adaptive language simplification, and personalized feedback mechanisms to facilitate more inclusive human-computer interaction. Evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements in user engagement and task completion rates for users with dyslexia.
