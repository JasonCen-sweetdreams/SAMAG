Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have garnered significant attention in recent years. However, most existing ERS models rely on heuristic feature attribution methods, which may not accurately capture complex user-item relationships. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework, which leverages graph attention mechanisms to model item relationships and user preferences. HGAT learns to generate personalized explanations for recommended items, outperforming state-of-the-art ERS models on several benchmark datasets. We further demonstrate the efficacy of HGAT in real-world scenarios, showcasing its potential to enhance user trust and satisfaction in recommendation systems.
