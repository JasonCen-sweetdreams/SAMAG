Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal execution plan based on the query workload, data distribution, and system resources. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
