Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and query patterns. This paper proposes a novel data-aware indexing approach, 'DAI', which leverages machine learning-based data summarization to guide query optimization. By selectively indexing data regions with high query relevance, DAI reduces query latency and improves resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that DAI outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in query performance and 2x in resource efficiency.
