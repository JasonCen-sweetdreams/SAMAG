Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve cognitive training and rehabilitation for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often pose accessibility challenges for this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an accessible VR interface, 'CogniVR', tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key design parameters, including font size, color scheme, and navigation mechanisms. Our results show that CogniVR significantly improves user engagement and task completion rates compared to traditional VR interfaces. The implications of our findings are discussed in the context of designing inclusive VR experiences for older adults.
