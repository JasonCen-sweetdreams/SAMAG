Voice assistants have the potential to empower older adults with cognitive impairments, but current systems often fall short in accommodating their needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, 'CAREVA', tailored to individuals with mild cognitive impairment. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability evaluations, yielding insights into the importance of clear prompts, simple language, and adaptive error handling. Our prototype, CAREVA, incorporates these findings and demonstrates improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants. This work contributes to the development of more accessible and supportive voice-based interfaces for older adults.
