Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable recommendations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in ERS, but their explainability is limited. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel GNN architecture that incorporates hierarchical graph attention mechanisms to capture complex user-item relationships. HGAT learns to attend to relevant nodes and edges, generating interpretable recommendations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing visually interpretable explanations.
