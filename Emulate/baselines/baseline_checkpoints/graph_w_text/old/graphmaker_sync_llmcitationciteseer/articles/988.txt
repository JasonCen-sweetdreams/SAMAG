This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to be assigned to tasks with diverse requirements. We propose a decentralized auction-based mechanism, called 'AgentsBid', which leverages the concept of Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions to ensure efficient task allocation. AgentsBid allows agents to bid on tasks based on their private valuations, and the mechanism determines the optimal assignment while incentivizing truthful bidding. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that AgentsBid outperforms existing decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, agent satisfaction, and communication overhead.
