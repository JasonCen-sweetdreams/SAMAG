Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, yet the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of haptic feedback on user engagement, satisfaction, and performance in VR environments. Our study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative user feedback. Results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user experience, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained motor control. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of haptic-enabled VR interfaces and identify areas for future research.
