In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that combines auction-based mechanisms with reinforcement learning. Our approach, called Dec-Auction, enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing task requirements and agent capabilities. We evaluate Dec-Auction in a simulated environment and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving high system utility and fairness compared to centralized and decentralized baselines. Our results show that Dec-Auction can scale to large numbers of agents and tasks, making it a promising solution for real-world multi-agent systems.
