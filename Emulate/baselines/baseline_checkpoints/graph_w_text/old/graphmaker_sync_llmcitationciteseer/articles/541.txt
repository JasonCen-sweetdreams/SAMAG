As multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for explainable decision-making processes grows. This paper introduces HAN-MAD, a hierarchical attention network architecture that enables transparent and interpretable decision-making in multi-agent settings. By incorporating agent-specific attention mechanisms and hierarchical reasoning, HAN-MAD outperforms existing methods in terms of decision quality and explainability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN-MAD in a variety of scenarios, including autonomous vehicle coordination and supply chain management.
