Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but users with motor impairments face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'AccessibleVR', a novel VR interface that accommodates users with varying levels of motor ability. We introduce a gesture recognition system that adapts to individual users' abilities, allowing for precise and intuitive control of VR interactions. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates that AccessibleVR significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing VR interfaces. Our findings inform the development of inclusive VR experiences that promote equal access for users with motor impairments.
