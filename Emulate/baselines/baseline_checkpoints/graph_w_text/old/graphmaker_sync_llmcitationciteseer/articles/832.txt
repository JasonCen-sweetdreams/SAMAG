This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents possess diverse capabilities and operate in dynamic environments. We leverage deep reinforcement learning to train agents to learn optimal task assignment policies, taking into account their individual strengths, weaknesses, and environmental constraints. Our approach, coined 'HRL-TA', employs a hierarchical architecture that combines a high-level task allocator with low-level agent controllers. Experimental results demonstrate that HRL-TA outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency, agent utilization, and system adaptability.
