Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed graph databases. Our approach, called GraphRL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the graph structure, query characteristics, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphRL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
