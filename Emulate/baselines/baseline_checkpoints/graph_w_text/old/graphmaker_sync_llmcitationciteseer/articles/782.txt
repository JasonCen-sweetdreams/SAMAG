Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed query plans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages machine learning techniques to optimize query plans for distributed database systems. Our approach uses a graph neural network to learn the query plan space and a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the query execution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
