The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms has severe consequences for individuals and society. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture for explainable fake news detection. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model the complex relationships between news articles, users, and their interactions, while attention mechanisms enable the identification of influential nodes and edges. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on a large-scale dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance and providing interpretable explanations for its predictions.
