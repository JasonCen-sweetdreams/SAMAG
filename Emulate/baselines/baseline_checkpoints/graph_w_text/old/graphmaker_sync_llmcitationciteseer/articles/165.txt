Few-shot node classification is a crucial task in graph-based learning, where a model must generalize to novel classes with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HiGAT) that leverages both local and global node representations to tackle this problem. HiGAT introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively aggregates node features across multiple graph resolutions, enabling the model to capture complex patterns and relationships. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGAT in few-shot node classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
