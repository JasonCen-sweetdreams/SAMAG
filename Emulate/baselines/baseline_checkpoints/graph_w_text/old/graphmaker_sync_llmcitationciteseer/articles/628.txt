Time series data is increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can have devastating consequences in applications such as finance and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect adversarial attacks on time series data using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We model the time series data as a graph, where each timestamp is a node, and the edges represent temporal dependencies. Our GCN-based detector, 'TS-Guard', learns to identify patterns indicative of adversarial attacks. We evaluate TS-Guard on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
