Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture query intent, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'NQGE', which leverages neural query graph embeddings to model complex query relationships. NQGE learns to represent queries as dense vectors, enabling efficient computation of semantic similarities between queries and documents. Our experiments on several TREC benchmarks demonstrate that NQGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving up to 15% improvement in mean average precision.
