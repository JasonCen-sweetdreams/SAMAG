Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches are often computationally expensive and struggle to handle real-time queries. We propose a novel indexing technique, 'EDIN', which leverages graph convolutional networks to encode entity representations and a hierarchical indexing structure to accelerate lookup. Our experiments on the DBpedia and YAGO knowledge graphs demonstrate that EDIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time while maintaining high disambiguation accuracy.
