Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexities of graph traversal and distributed execution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query performance. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
