Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to improve the retrieval performance by incorporating relevant terms into the original query. This paper explores the application of deep neural ranking models for query expansion, leveraging their ability to capture semantic relationships between queries and documents. We propose a novel neural architecture that integrates a query-document interaction module with a term importance estimator, enabling the model to selectively expand the query with relevant terms while preserving the original query intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming traditional query expansion methods and state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
