Query expansion is a crucial technique for improving the retrieval effectiveness of short text documents. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational costs and limited domain adaptability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, termed 'Hy QE', which leverages a combination of local and global context embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Hy QE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while also exhibiting robustness to out-of-domain queries.
