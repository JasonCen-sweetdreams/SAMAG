Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization, which leverages a combination of machine learning and graph-based methods to efficiently optimize query plans. Our approach, called 'DistributedQueryOptimizer', utilizes a distributed architecture to parallelize the optimization process, reducing query processing times by up to 50%. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving query performance and scalability.
