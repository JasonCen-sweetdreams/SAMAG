Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval (IR) that involves retrieving relevant documents for a given query. One of the most effective techniques to improve retrieval performance is query expansion, which involves adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. We leverage the capabilities of language models to generate a set of expanded queries and then use a ranking model to select the most effective ones. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a relative improvement of up to 25% in terms of mean average precision.
