Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing requirements. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization, which leverages the structural properties of the database schema to identify efficient query plans. We introduce a graph neural network-based model that learns to predict optimal query plans from a set of training queries. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x in query execution time.
