Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between data distribution, indexing, and query execution plans. This paper presents a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the benefits of traditional B-tree indexing with the flexibility of learned indexing techniques. We propose a cost-based optimization framework that adaptively selects the most effective indexing strategy for a given query and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
