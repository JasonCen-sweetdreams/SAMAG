This paper addresses the problem of distributed task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and resource constraints need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to learn decentralized policies for task allocation, taking into account their individual capabilities, communication overhead, and task dependencies. Our approach is evaluated on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
