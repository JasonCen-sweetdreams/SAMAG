In multi-agent systems, decision-making often involves complex interactions and trade-offs between agents. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable decision-making in such systems. Our approach combines graph attention networks with hierarchical reinforcement learning to learn agent-specific policies that balance individual goals with global objectives. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a simulated smart city scenario, where HAN improves decision-making efficiency and transparency compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods.
