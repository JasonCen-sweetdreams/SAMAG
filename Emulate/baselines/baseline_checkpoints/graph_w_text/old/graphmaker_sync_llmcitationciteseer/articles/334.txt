As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible and effective interfaces for older adults. This study investigates the use of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) as a means to reduce cognitive load in older adults during human-computer interaction. We designed an ECA-based system that utilizes gestures, facial expressions, and vocal cues to facilitate communication. A user study involving 30 older adults (ages 65-85) showed that the ECA-based system significantly reduced cognitive load, measured through pupil dilation and self-reported workload, compared to a text-based interface. Our findings have implications for the design of accessible interfaces that can promote digital inclusion for older adults.
