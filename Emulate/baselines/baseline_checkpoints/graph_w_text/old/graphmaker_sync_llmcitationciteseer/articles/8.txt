Node classification on large-scale heterogeneous graphs is a fundamental problem in graph analysis. Existing methods often rely on flat graph structures, neglecting hierarchical relationships between nodes. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework that leverages attention mechanisms to learn node representations at multiple scales. HGAT recursively applies graph attention to capture hierarchical dependencies, enabling more accurate node classification. Experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate HGAT's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, especially on graphs with complex hierarchical structures.
