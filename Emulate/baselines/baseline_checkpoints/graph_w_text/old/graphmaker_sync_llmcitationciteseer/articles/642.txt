Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of users with dyslexia. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces, focusing on text-based input and output modalities. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with dyslexia, which revealed significant difficulties with reading and writing comprehension, as well as high anxiety levels when interacting with current chatbots. We propose a set of design guidelines and a novel interface prototype, 'DyslexiaAware', which incorporates adaptive font sizes, color schemes, and error-tolerant input processing to facilitate more accessible and engaging interactions. Our evaluation shows that DyslexiaAware significantly improves user experience and reduces anxiety levels compared to existing chatbot interfaces.
