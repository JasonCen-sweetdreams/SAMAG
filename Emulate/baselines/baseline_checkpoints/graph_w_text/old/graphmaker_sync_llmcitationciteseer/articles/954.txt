Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, existing indexing techniques struggle to keep up with the growing scale and velocity of graph data. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'GraphSprint', which leverages a combination of compression, caching, and parallel processing to enable real-time graph analytics. We evaluate GraphSprint on several real-world graph datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing techniques, achieving up to 5x faster query response times and 3x better storage efficiency.
