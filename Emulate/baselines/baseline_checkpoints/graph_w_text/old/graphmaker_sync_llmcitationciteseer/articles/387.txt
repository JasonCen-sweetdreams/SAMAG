Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data storage and querying. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and use deep Q-networks to learn an optimal policy for selecting the best query plan. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and reduces the number of communication rounds between nodes.
