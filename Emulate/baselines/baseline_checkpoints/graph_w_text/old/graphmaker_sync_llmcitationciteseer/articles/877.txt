Distributed database systems (DDS) face the challenge of optimizing query workloads to minimize latency and improve resource utilization. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize query scheduling in DDS. We design a DRL agent that learns to predict query execution times and selects the optimal query plan based on real-time system metrics. Our experiments on a distributed database benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in query throughput and response time compared to traditional rule-based scheduling algorithms.
