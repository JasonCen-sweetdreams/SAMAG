In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize agent decision-making. We propose a decentralized Q-learning approach, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
