We present Hierarchical Task Allocation (HTA), a novel framework for efficient task allocation in large-scale multi-agent systems. HTA leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning to learn both high-level task assignment policies and low-level agent control policies. Our approach enables agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions, while minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results on a realistic logistics scenario demonstrate that HTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and adaptability to dynamic changes.
