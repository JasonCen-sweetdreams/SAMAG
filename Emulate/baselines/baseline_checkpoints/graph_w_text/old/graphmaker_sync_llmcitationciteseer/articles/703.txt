Mobile interfaces rely heavily on icons to convey information and guide user interactions. This study investigates the effect of animated icons on user engagement, exploring whether animations can improve user experience and increase interaction time. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, comparing static and animated icon designs in a social media app. Our results show that animated icons significantly increase user interaction time, but only when the animation is subtle and contextually relevant. We also identified individual differences in user preferences, highlighting the need for personalized icon designs. The findings provide insights for HCI designers and researchers seeking to enhance mobile interface usability.
