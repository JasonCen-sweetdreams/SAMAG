Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval, but existing methods often rely on simplistic term co-occurrence or word embeddings that ignore nuanced semantic relationships. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach, 'SemExpan', which leverages semantic embeddings derived from a knowledge graph to enrich query representations. We demonstrate that SemExpan outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall. Our experiments also show that SemExpan is robust to query ambiguity and effectively captures domain-specific relationships.
