Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but accessibility remains a significant barrier for users with motor impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces that accommodate users with motor impairments. Our approach involves a user-centered design process, incorporating input from individuals with motor impairments, to identify and address specific accessibility challenges. We propose a set of accessible VR interface design guidelines and evaluate their effectiveness through a user study with 20 participants. Results show that our guidelines significantly improve the usability and accessibility of VR interfaces for users with motor impairments.
