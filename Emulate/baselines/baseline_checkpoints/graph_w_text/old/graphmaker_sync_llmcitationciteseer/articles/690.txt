The increasing complexity of modern distributed relational databases necessitates efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, called 'RL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database's workload and system conditions. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-QO outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x in query execution time while reducing resource utilization by 30%.
