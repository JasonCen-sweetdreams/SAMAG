Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages deep semantic role labeling (SRL) to identify and incorporate latent query aspects. Our approach, DRQE, employs a neural SRL model to extract predicate-argument structures from query terms and then reinforces the query representation with these extracted structures. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate that DRQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
