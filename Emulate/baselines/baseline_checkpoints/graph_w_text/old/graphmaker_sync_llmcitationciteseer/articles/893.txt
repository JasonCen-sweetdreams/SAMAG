Traditional document ranking models rely heavily on lexical matching and term frequency-based features. In this paper, we propose a novel context-aware ranking framework that leverages neural query graphs to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and document contents. Our approach represents queries as graph-structured neural networks, which are trained to learn the contextual dependencies between query terms and their importance for the search task. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art ranking models, particularly in cases where the query context is ambiguous or nuanced.
