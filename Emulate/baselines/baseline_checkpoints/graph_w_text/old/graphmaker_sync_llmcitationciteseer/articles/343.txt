In complex systems, resource allocation requires efficient coordination among heterogeneous agents with varying capabilities and objectives. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize real-time resource allocation in multi-agent systems. Our method, called 'HARDRL', uses a centralized critic to evaluate the global system state and decentralized actor networks to compute optimal actions for each agent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HARDRL in a simulated smart grid scenario, achieving improved resource utilization and reduced response times compared to traditional optimization methods.
