Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding approach, GraphQE, which leverages the semantic relationships between words to generate more effective expansion terms. We model the query-document interaction as a graph, where nodes represent words and edges capture their co-occurrence patterns. By learning dense vector representations for words in this graph, we can identify more informative expansion terms that improve retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphQE over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
