This study explores the role of personalized avatar embodiment in enhancing user engagement in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR platform using either a generic or personalized avatar, and measured their engagement levels through physiological and behavioral metrics. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars reported higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and motivation, and exhibited increased physiological arousal. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR systems that aim to promote user engagement and well-being.
