Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR), particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. Our proposed model, 'QRN', leverages the semantic relationships between words in the query and document collections to generate expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that QRN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
