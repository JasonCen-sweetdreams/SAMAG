Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have become increasingly popular due to their scalability and ease of use. However, query optimization in multi-tenant DBaaS environments remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MQO', which leverages machine learning-based prediction models to identify optimal query plans. MQO incorporates a feedback loop that continuously refines query optimization based on runtime statistics and user feedback, resulting in improved query performance and reduced resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate that MQO outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30%.
