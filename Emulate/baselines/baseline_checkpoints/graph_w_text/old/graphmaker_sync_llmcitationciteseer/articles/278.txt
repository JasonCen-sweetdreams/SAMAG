This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for multi-agent dialogue systems, enabling explainable decision-making in complex conversational scenarios. Our approach leverages a hierarchical structure to model agent interactions, combining local and global attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant context and agents. We evaluate our method on a suite of dialogue benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of attention patterns, offering insights into the decision-making process of our model.
