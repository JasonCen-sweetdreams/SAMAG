Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variations in expression. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of each modality to improve emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention modules that adaptively weight features from each input source, followed by a fusion module that integrates the output from each modality. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.5% in terms of emotion recognition accuracy, while providing interpretable attention weights that reveal the importance of each modality in emotion recognition.
