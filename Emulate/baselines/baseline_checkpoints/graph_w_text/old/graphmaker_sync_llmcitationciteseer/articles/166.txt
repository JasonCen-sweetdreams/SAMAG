Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, aiming to provide transparent and trustworthy suggestions to users. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) model that incorporates both user-item interactions and item relationships to generate personalized explanations. HGAT utilizes a hierarchical graph structure to model complex relationships between items and applies attention mechanisms to identify influential items in the explanation process. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation performance and providing informative explanations.
