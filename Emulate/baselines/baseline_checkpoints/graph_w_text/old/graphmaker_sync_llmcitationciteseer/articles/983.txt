Older adults with dementia face significant challenges interacting with digital systems, hindering their autonomy and quality of life. This paper presents 'EasyReach', a gesture-based interface designed to improve accessibility and usability for this population. We conducted a user-centered design study with 20 older adults with dementia, identifying key cognitive and motor impairments that inform our design. EasyReach incorporates simplified gestures, visual cues, and auditory feedback to facilitate intuitive interaction. A usability evaluation with 15 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional touchscreen interfaces.
