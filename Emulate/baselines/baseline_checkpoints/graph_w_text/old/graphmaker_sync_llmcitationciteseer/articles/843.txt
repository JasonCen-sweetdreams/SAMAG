Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR) due to the ambiguity and variability of user queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. Our model, 'DeepQE', uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural layers to capture both local and global contextual information. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of mean average precision and recall, while being computationally efficient.
