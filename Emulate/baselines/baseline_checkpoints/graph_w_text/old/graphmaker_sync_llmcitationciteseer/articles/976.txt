In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, real-world scenarios often involve uncertain resource availability, which can lead to suboptimal task assignments. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework, called 'URA-Alloc', which leverages probability theory to model resource uncertainty. We develop a decentralized algorithm that enables agents to exchange information and adapt to changing resource conditions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that URA-Alloc outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization.
