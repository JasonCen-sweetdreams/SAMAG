This paper presents an investigation into the design of adaptive haptic feedback for virtual reality (VR) applications. We propose a novel framework, 'HapTiX', which leverages machine learning to personalize haptic feedback to individual users' preferences and behaviors. Our approach incorporates a user study to collect data on haptic perception and a range of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of HapTiX in enhancing VR experience. Results show significant improvements in user engagement and immersion, with participants reporting increased sense of presence and enjoyment.
