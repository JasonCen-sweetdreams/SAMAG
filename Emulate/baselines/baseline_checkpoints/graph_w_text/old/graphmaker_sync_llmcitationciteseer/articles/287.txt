In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects overall system efficiency. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for autonomous task allocation, where a high-level controller assigns tasks to agents based on their capabilities and availability. Our approach leverages a novel attention mechanism to identify the most critical tasks and allocate them to the most suitable agents. We evaluate our approach in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to traditional methods.
