Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. Despite the success of deep learning models, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to detect anomalies in time series data. Our approach enables the identification of relevant features and time steps contributing to the anomaly, thereby providing explainability. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability.
