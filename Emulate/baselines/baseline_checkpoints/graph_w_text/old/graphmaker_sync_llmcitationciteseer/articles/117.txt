Distributed database systems (DDBS) have become increasingly popular for scalable data storage and processing. However, optimizing query plans in DDBS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select optimal query plans based on the system's workload and data distribution. Our experiments on a real-world DDBS benchmark show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
