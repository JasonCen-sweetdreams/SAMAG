The increasing volume and velocity of time-series data poses significant challenges for distributed database systems. Existing indexing techniques struggle to provide efficient query processing and data ingestion in real-time. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'TS-Index', which leverages a combination of Bloom filters and hierarchical clustering to enable scalable and efficient time-series data management. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-Index through a comprehensive evaluation on a large-scale IoT dataset, showcasing significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
