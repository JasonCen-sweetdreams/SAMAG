This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents are autonomous and heterogeneous. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to learn how to allocate tasks effectively, taking into account their individual capabilities and the dynamic environment. The framework is evaluated in a simulated search and rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods. The results show promise for applying autonomous task allocation to real-world applications, such as disaster response and smart cities.
