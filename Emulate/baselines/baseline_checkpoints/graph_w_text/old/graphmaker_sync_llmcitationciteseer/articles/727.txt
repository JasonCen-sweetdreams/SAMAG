In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We propose a novel DCOP algorithm, 'AgentDAC', which leverages asynchronous communication and local search to find near-optimal task assignments. Our experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that AgentDAC outperforms existing decentralized methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of our approach to agent failures and dynamic task requirements.
