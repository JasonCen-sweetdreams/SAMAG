Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and high query volumes. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. Our approach, called 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query execution plan based on the system's workload and resource utilization. We evaluate RL-QOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
