Distributed relational databases are increasingly popular for managing large-scale data. However, query optimization remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed relational databases. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query plan generation. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world dataset and show that it outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
