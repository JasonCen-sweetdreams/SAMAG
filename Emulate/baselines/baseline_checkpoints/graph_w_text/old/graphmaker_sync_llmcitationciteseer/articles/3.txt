Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to the growing need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that leverages graph-based embedding techniques to provide personalized recommendations while offering insightful explanations. Our approach incorporates multi-level graph attention mechanisms to capture complex item relationships and user preferences. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.
