Coordinating multiple agents in complex, dynamic environments is a challenging task in artificial intelligence. Existing approaches often rely on opaque, black-box models that fail to provide insights into their decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable multi-agent cooperation. Our HAN model combines task-oriented attention with social attention, allowing agents to selectively focus on relevant tasks and teammates. We evaluate our approach in a simulated search-and-rescue domain and demonstrate improved team performance, interpretability, and robustness to agent failures.
