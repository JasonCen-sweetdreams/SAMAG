Recommendation systems have become increasingly important in modern online services, but their complexity and scalability remain significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that leverages the strengths of both graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to improve recommendation accuracy and efficiency. HGAT learns to represent users and items as hierarchical graph structures, enabling it to capture complex relationships and dependencies at multiple scales. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy, while also reducing computational costs and improving scalability.
