Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We represent the database schema and query plan as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn a distributed query optimization policy. Our approach, called 'GQN', outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query latency and resource utilization. We evaluate GQN using a real-world dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in a distributed database setting.
