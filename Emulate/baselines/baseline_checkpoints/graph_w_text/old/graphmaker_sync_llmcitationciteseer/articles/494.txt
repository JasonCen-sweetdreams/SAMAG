Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems to improve the retrieval performance. Traditional query expansion methods rely on hand-crafted rules and thesauri, which may not capture the nuances of natural language. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach for query expansion, 'DeepQE', which learns to predict relevant expansion terms from a large corpus of text data. Our approach leverages a combination of word embeddings and attention mechanisms to capture context-dependent semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in retrieval performance.
