Ad-hoc retrieval often relies on query expansion to improve retrieval performance. However, traditional methods suffer from limited contextual understanding and semantic mismatch. This paper proposes a novel neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuroXPand', which leverages pre-trained language models to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroXPand outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and robustness.
