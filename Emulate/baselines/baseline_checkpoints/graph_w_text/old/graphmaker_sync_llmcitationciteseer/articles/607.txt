Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering and shallow learning techniques. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. We propose a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion and relevance ranking, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepQE can effectively capture nuanced query-document relationships, leading to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
