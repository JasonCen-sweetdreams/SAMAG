Distributed graph databases are increasingly used in modern data analytics, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphRL', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed graph databases. GraphRL uses a graph neural network to learn a policy that adapts to changing query workloads and optimizes query execution times. Our experiments on a real-world social network dataset show that GraphRL achieves an average query performance improvement of 30% compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
