In this paper, we propose a decentralized approach to task allocation for autonomous agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our method, dubbed 'DARLA', enables agents to learn cooperative strategies for allocating tasks in a dynamic environment. We model the task allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and design a novel reward function that encourages agents to explore and adapt to changing task demands. Experimental results demonstrate that DARLA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to changes in task availability.
