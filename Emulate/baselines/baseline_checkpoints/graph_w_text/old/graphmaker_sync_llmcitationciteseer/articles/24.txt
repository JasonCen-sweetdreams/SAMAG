Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effect of haptic feedback on user satisfaction, engagement, and performance in VR environments. We designed and implemented a custom VR platform with varying levels of haptic feedback and conducted a user study with 40 participants. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user experience, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained motor control. We also identify a strong correlation between haptic feedback and user engagement, suggesting that haptic feedback can be a key factor in VR adoption.
