Traditional ranking models in information retrieval (IR) often suffer from scalability issues and limited contextual understanding. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HiRank', which leverages the strengths of both lexical and semantic matching. HiRank uses a multi-level attention mechanism to effectively capture document-level and passage-level relevance, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that HiRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving a 12% increase in mean average precision.
