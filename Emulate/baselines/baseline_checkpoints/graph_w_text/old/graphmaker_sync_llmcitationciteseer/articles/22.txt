Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in knowledge graph construction, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in text. Existing approaches often suffer from scalability issues or rely on expensive manual annotations. We propose a novel graph-based embedding approach, 'GraphDE', which leverages the structural properties of knowledge graphs to learn entity representations. GraphDE uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global contextual information, resulting in improved disambiguation accuracy. We evaluate GraphDE on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness in real-world applications.
