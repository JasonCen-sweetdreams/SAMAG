We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for large-scale traffic signal control. Our approach, dubbed 'TrafficMAgent', leverages a graph neural network to model the traffic network and enables each agent to learn a decentralized policy for controlling its corresponding traffic signal. We evaluate TrafficMAgent on a realistic traffic simulation platform and demonstrate significant improvements in reducing congestion and travel times compared to traditional centralized control methods. Moreover, our approach scales to large networks with hundreds of intersections, making it a promising solution for real-world traffic management.
