Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems to improve retrieval performance. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and rule-based approaches, which can be time-consuming and ineffective. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn query representations and expand queries. We introduce a novel attention-based mechanism to weigh the importance of each term in the query and generate effective expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
