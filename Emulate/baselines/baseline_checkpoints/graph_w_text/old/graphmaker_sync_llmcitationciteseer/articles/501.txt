This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. We propose a framework, 'RL-TA', which enables agents to learn optimal task allocation strategies through interactions with their environment. RL-TA integrates a decentralized Q-learning algorithm with a novel reward function that incorporates both task completion and resource utilization. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that RL-TA outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion rate and resource efficiency. Our approach has significant implications for real-world applications such as search and rescue operations and autonomous warehouse management.
