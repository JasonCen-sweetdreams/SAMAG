Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and system scalability. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which often lead to suboptimal query plans. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'QOptRL', which learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database system and adapting to changing workloads. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that QOptRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
