Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data management, but optimizing query performance remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select optimal query plans based on a reward function that balances execution time and resource utilization. Our experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and reduces resource utilization by up to 25%
