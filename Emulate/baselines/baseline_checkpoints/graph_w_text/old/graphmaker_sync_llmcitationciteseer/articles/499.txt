Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of personalized haptic feedback in enhancing user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR platform that incorporated real-time haptic feedback tailored to individual users' preferences. Our results show that personalized haptic feedback significantly increases user engagement, measured through subjective ratings and objective metrics such as time spent in the VR environment. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems.
