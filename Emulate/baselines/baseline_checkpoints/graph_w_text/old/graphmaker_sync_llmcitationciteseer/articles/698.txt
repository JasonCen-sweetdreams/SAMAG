Voice-based interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their usability for older adults with hearing impairments is often overlooked. This study investigates the design of inclusive voice-based interfaces that cater to this demographic. We conducted user studies with 30 older adults to identify challenges and preferences in voice interaction. Our findings informed the development of 'HearMe', a voice-based interface that incorporates acoustic enhancements, visual feedback, and personalized audio profiles. A follow-up evaluation with 20 participants showed significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants. Our work contributes to the development of more accessible and user-centered voice-based interfaces for older adults with hearing impairments.
