Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between queries and documents. This paper presents a novel QE approach that leverages deep learning-based contextual embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and their expansion candidates. We propose a neural network architecture that integrates BERT-based contextualized embeddings with a graph-based ranking model, allowing for more effective term weighting and selection. Experimental results on several TREC benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance over state-of-the-art QE methods, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
