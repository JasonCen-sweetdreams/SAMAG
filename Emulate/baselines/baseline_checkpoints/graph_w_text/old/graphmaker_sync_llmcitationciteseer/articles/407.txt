This paper presents a novel approach to gesture recognition systems that cater to individuals with motor impairments. We propose a machine learning-based framework that leverages computer vision and sensor data to recognize subtle gestures, accommodating varying levels of motor ability. Our system incorporates a user-centered design approach, involving participants with motor impairments in the development process. Experimental results demonstrate improved recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems, highlighting the potential for assistive technology to enhance the quality of life for individuals with motor impairments.
