Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale data. However, optimizing queries in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and network topology. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the DDS environment and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Our approach, called QOpt-RL, outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and reduces the number of network communications by up to 25%. We evaluate QOpt-RL on a real-world DDS benchmark and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving query performance.
