The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles in smart grids requires efficient real-time resource allocation to ensure reliability and stability. This paper proposes an adaptive multi-agent coordination framework, 'AdaptMAS', which integrates reinforcement learning and graph theory to optimize resource allocation in dynamic grid environments. AdaptMAS enables agents to learn from experience and adapt to changing grid conditions, resulting in improved allocation efficiency and reduced power losses. Experimental results using real-world grid data demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaptMAS in mitigating power outages and reducing energy costs.
