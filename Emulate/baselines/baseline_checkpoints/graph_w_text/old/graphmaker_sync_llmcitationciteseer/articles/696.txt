Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to improve the accessibility of voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and industry experts to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of 'EasyVocal', a voice assistant prototype that incorporates age-related adaptations, such as simplified language processing, multilingual support, and personalized assistants. We evaluate EasyVocal through a usability study, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction among older adults.
