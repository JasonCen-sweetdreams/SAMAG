Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information, but the lack of personalized avatars can lead to a sense of disconnection. This study investigates the effect of customized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized or generic avatar condition. Results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, satisfaction, and self-presence in VR. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems and highlight the importance of incorporating user modeling and avatar personalization to enhance user experience.
