Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the accuracy of search results. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based approach to query expansion, which leverages semantic embeddings to capture the relationships between terms. Our method, called GraphExpan, represents the query and document terms as nodes in a graph, and uses graph convolutional networks to learn their embeddings. We evaluate GraphExpan on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval performance, particularly for short and ambiguous queries. Our experiments show that GraphExpan outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as Rocchio and latent semantic analysis.
