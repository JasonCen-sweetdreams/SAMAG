Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a reward function that captures the trade-offs between query execution time, resource utilization, and data freshness, and train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query optimization policy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
