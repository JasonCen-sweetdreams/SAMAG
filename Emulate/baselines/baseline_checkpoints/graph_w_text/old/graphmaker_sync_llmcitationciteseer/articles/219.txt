The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential growth in time-series data, necessitating efficient indexing techniques for real-time analytics. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'TS-Tree', which combines a hierarchical tree structure with a compact bitmap representation. TS-Tree enables fast range queries, aggregation, and pattern matching, while reducing storage overhead. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that TS-Tree outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 5x in query response time and 3x in storage efficiency.
