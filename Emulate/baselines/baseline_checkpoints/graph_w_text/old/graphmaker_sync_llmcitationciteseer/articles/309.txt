Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing inclusive voice-based interfaces tailored to the needs of this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing with 30 older adults with cognitive impairments. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and feedback in interface design. We propose a set of design guidelines and a prototype system, 'EasyVoice', which incorporates these principles to facilitate more effective and accessible interactions.
