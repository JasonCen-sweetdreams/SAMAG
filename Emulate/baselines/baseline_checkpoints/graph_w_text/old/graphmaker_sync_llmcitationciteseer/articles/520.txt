Recommender systems have become a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms. However, the scale and complexity of user-item interaction graphs pose significant challenges for traditional recommendation algorithms. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture, which leverages self-attention mechanisms to learn hierarchical representations of users and items. By incorporating graph attention at multiple scales, HGAT effectively captures complex relationships between users and items, leading to improved recommendation performance. Experimental results on several large-scale datasets demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of HGAT, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by up to 15% in terms of precision and recall.
