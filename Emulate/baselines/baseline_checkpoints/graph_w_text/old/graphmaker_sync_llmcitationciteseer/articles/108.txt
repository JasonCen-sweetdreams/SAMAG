In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task allocation policies in a decentralized manner. Our approach, called GraphTask, represents the agents and tasks as a graph and uses a GNN to learn the optimal task allocation based on the graph structure and node features. We evaluate GraphTask on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating its ability to adapt to changing task requirements and agent capabilities, outperforming traditional decentralized task allocation algorithms.
