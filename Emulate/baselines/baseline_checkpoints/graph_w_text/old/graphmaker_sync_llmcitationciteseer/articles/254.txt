This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the role of gesture-based interaction in enhancing user experience. We designed a VR system that tracks users' gestures and examines how they influence cognitive processes, such as spatial reasoning and problem-solving. Our study reveals that embodied interaction improves users' performance and engagement in VR tasks, particularly when leveraging intuitive gestures that mimic real-world actions. The findings have implications for the design of more effective and immersive VR interfaces, with potential applications in fields like education, training, and therapy.
