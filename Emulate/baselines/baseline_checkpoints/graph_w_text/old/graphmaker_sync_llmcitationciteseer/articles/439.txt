Effective resource allocation is critical in multi-robot systems, where agents must coordinate to achieve complex tasks. This paper presents a novel agent-based framework, 'CoARA', which leverages decentralized decision-making and adaptive negotiation to optimize resource allocation. CoARA incorporates a hierarchical auction mechanism, allowing agents to bid on resources based on task priorities and resource availability. Our experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that CoARA outperforms existing centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
