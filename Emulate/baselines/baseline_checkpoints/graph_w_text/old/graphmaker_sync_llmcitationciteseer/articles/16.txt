Traditional query expansion techniques rely on manual rules and thesauri, which can be ineffective in modern search engines dealing with vast amounts of data. We propose a neural query expansion (NQE) model that learns to generate relevant expansion terms from a large corpus of text data. Our approach leverages a combination of word embeddings and attention mechanisms to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Experimental results on the TREC dataset show that NQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency, with a 23% increase in mean average precision.
