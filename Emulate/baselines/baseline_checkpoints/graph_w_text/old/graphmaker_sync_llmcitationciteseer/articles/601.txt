This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model for efficient document retrieval in information retrieval systems. Our approach leverages a multi-level architecture to capture both local and global semantic relationships between query and document terms. The model is trained using a combination of pointwise and pairwise ranking loss functions, which enables effective optimization of retrieval metrics such as NDCG and MAP. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
