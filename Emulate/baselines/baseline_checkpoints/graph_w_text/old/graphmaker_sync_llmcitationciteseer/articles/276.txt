Virtual assistants (VAs) are increasingly being used in healthcare settings to support clinicians with tasks such as documentation and communication. However, their lack of emotional intelligence (EI) can lead to frustration and burnout. This paper presents a framework for designing emotionally intelligent VAs that can recognize and respond to healthcare professionals' emotions. We propose a multimodal emotion recognition system that combines natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and affective computing. A user study with 20 clinicians shows that our EI-VA prototype reduces feelings of frustration and anxiety, while improving overall user experience and task performance.
