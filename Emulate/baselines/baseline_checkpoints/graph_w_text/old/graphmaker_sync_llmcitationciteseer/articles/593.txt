Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component in modern analytics pipelines, necessitating efficient query optimization techniques. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'ColOpt', which leverages column store indexing to accelerate query execution in real-time data warehousing. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that considers both data freshness and query latency, enabling the system to adapt to dynamic workloads. Experimental results on a popular benchmark dataset demonstrate that ColOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x, while maintaining data freshness within specified bounds.
