Resource Description Framework (RDF) triple stores have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large amounts of semantic data. However, optimizing queries over these stores remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize RDF query execution. Our technique, called 'RDFOpt', uses a combination of feature engineering and reinforcement learning to learn the optimal query execution plan. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that RDFOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
