The efficient allocation of tasks to agents is crucial for maintaining the functionality of smart city infrastructure. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize the assignment of tasks to agents in real-time. Our approach, dubbed 'SMART- allocation', integrates a graph neural network-based task representation with a distributed deep Q-network that learns to allocate tasks based on agent capabilities, task urgency, and network constraints. Experimental results on a simulated smart city scenario demonstrate that SMART-allocation outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, average response time, and network latency.
