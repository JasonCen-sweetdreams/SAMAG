Distributed database systems (DDS) have become crucial in modern data-intensive applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select the most efficient query plan based on the characteristics of the dataset and the DDS architecture. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
