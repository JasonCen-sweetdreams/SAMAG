Individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder characterized by slow, slurred, or distorted speech, often face significant barriers when interacting with voice assistants. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an accessible voice assistant, 'EasySpeak', tailored to the needs of individuals with dysarthria. We employ a multimodal approach, combining speech recognition with gesture-based input and adaptive acoustic models to improve recognition accuracy. A user study with 20 participants with dysarthria demonstrates that EasySpeak outperforms commercial voice assistants in terms of recognition accuracy, user satisfaction, and task completion time.
