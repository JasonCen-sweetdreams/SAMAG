Neural search engines have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but they often struggle with vocabulary mismatch issues. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQR', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion policies. Our method uses a neural agent to learn a policy that selects expansion terms based on their expected retrieval performance. We evaluate DeepQR on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
