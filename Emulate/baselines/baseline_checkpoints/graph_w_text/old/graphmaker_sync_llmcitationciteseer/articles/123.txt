Traditional ranking models for information retrieval (IR) often fail to capture the complex relationships between query terms and document content. This paper proposes a novel context-aware document ranking framework, HierRank, which leverages hierarchical neural networks to model the interactions between query terms, document entities, and contextual features. Our approach incorporates a graph-based attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant document regions and a hierarchical pooling strategy to aggregate context-aware representations. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art IR models, achieving significant improvements in ranking precision and recall.
