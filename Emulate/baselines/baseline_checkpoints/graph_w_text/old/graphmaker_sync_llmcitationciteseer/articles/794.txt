Distributed relational databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data-intensive applications. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging problem due to the inherent complexity of distributed query planning. This paper proposes a novel approach to scalable query optimization using reinforcement learning. We develop a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with a distributed database simulator. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query latency and resource utilization, while also providing robustness to varying database workloads.
