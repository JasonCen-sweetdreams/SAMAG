Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significance in recent years due to the increasing need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that leverages both user-item interactions and item attributes to generate personalized recommendations. Our approach incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple levels, allowing the model to focus on relevant features and relationships. We evaluate HGAT on three benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved recommendation performance, along with enhanced interpretability, compared to state-of-the-art ERS methods.
