This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating gesture-based interfaces that cater to older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants to understand their gesture preferences, abilities, and challenges. Our findings informed the development of a novel gesture recognition system that incorporates machine learning-based gesture adaptation and feedback mechanisms. A usability evaluation with 12 participants demonstrated significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user experience compared to existing systems. Our work contributes to the development of more inclusive and accessible interfaces for older adults with motor impairments.
