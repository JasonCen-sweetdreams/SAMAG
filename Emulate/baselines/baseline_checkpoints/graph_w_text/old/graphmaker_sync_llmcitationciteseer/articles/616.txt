This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems, leveraging cooperative game theory to optimize task assignments. We formulate the task allocation problem as a cooperative game and propose a distributed algorithm that enables agents to negotiate and agree on task assignments. Our approach takes into account agent capabilities, task dependencies, and communication constraints, ensuring efficient and coordinated task execution. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and system-wide utility compared to existing decentralized allocation methods.
