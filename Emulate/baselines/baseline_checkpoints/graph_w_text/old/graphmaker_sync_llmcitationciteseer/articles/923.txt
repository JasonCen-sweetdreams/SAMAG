Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study, comprising user interviews, surveys, and usability testing, to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings highlight the importance of simplifying language, providing explicit feedback, and accommodating cognitive and sensory impairments. We propose a set of design guidelines and a prototype system, 'ElderVoice', which demonstrates improved usability and accessibility for older adults.
