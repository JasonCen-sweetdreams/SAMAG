Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, optimizing query processing in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach for join order selection using machine learning-based models. Our approach leverages query execution statistics and database metadata to train a model that predicts the optimal join order for a given query. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods, resulting in up to 30% improvement in query execution time.
