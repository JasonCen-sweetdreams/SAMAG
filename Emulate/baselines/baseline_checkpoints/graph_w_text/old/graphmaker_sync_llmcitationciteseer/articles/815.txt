Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) for ERS, which captures complex user-item relationships and provides interpretable explanations. HGAT leverages a hierarchical graph structure to model user and item embeddings, and incorporates attention mechanisms to focus on relevant factors. We evaluate HGAT on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
