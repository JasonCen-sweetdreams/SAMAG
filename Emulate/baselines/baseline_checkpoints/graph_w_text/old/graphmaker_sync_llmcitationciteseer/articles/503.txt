This paper proposes a novel approach to decentralized coordination of autonomous agents using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the agent interactions as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn a decentralized coordination strategy that maximizes the global reward. Our approach, dubbed 'GraphAgent', is evaluated in a variety of multi-agent scenarios, including robotic swarm navigation and smart grid management. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphAgent outperforms traditional decentralized coordination methods, achieving higher rewards and more efficient communication.
