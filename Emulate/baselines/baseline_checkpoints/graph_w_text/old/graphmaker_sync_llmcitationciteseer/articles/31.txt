Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a crucial task in human-computer interaction. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical transfer learning (HTL) framework that leverages pre-trained modal-specific models and adapts them to a target multi-modal emotion recognition task. Our HTL approach exploits both within- and cross-modal relationships to improve transferability and reduce the need for large amounts of labeled data. Experimental results on the SEMAINE and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.
