Cognitive load management is crucial in complex tasks, where high mental workload can lead to errors and decreased performance. This paper explores the potential of augmented reality (AR) technology in mitigating cognitive load through the design of intuitive interfaces. We present an AR-based system, 'CogLoadAR', which leverages spatial cognition and gesture-based interactions to reduce mental effort. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that CogLoadAR significantly reduces cognitive load and improves task performance compared to traditional graphical user interfaces. Our findings have implications for the design of AR-based systems in high-stakes domains, such as aviation, healthcare, and finance.
