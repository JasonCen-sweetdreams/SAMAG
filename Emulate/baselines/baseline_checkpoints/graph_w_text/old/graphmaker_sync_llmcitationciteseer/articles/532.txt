Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, where the goal is to identify the correct entity referred to by a mention in a text. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical approach to entity disambiguation, leveraging graph-based attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between entities. Our method, HierGraph, first constructs a hierarchical graph representation of the knowledge graph, and then uses attention weights to selectively focus on relevant entities and their relationships. Experimental results on a large-scale benchmark dataset demonstrate that HierGraph outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and robustness to ambiguity.
