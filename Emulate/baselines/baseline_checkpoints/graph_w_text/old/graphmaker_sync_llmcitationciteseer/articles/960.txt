Effective negotiation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents need to reach agreements with each other to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a novel approach to autonomous negotiation using deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a multi-agent negotiation framework, 'DeepNegotiate', which leverages deep Q-networks to learn negotiation strategies for each agent. Our framework incorporates a hierarchical negotiation protocol that enables agents to negotiate at both local and global levels, leading to more efficient and effective agreements. Experimental results on a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate the superiority of DeepNegotiate over traditional negotiation strategies, achieving higher agreement rates and better resource allocation.
