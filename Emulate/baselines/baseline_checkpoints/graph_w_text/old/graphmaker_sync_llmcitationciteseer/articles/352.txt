Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly employed in real-world applications, necessitating efficient task allocation strategies. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAT) architecture that allocates tasks to agents in a transparent and interpretable manner. HAT captures intricate agent-agent and agent-task relationships, enabling the model to selectively focus on the most relevant features and agents when making allocation decisions. Our experiments on a suite of benchmark MAS datasets demonstrate that HAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of allocation efficiency, fairness, and stability, while providing insightful visualizations of the decision-making process.
