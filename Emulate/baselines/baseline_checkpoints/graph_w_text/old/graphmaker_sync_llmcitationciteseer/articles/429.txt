Distributed database systems are increasingly used for large-scale data processing, but optimizing query execution plans remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed environments. We develop a framework that uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query optimization, taking into account various factors such as data distribution, node availability, and network latency. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
