Industrial IoT systems generate massive amounts of time-series data, which makes anomaly detection a crucial task for ensuring efficiency and safety. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) that leverages both local and global patterns in the data. Our approach uses a hierarchical structure to model complex temporal dependencies and incorporates attention mechanisms to focus on the most informative segments. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that HAN-TSAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to variability in anomaly types.
