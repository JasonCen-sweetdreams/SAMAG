In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a task allocation policy. We represent the agent-task interactions as a graph and use GNNs to learn a latent representation of the agents and tasks. Our approach, called GraphTaskAlloc, outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization in simulated environments. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of our algorithm and demonstrate its applicability to real-world scenarios.
