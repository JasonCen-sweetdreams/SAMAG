Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, optimizing graph queries remains a challenging task, particularly for large-scale graphs. This paper presents a novel approach to graph query optimization using learned index structures. We propose a neural network-based model that learns to predict the optimal query plan for a given graph query, leveraging the structural properties of the graph. Experimental results on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques, reducing query execution times by up to 3x.
