Distributed database systems (DDS) face significant query performance challenges due to data fragmentation and network latency. This paper presents 'Adapdex', a novel adaptive indexing framework that dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distributions. Adapdex leverages machine learning algorithms to predict query hotspots and proactively reconfigures indexes to minimize query latency. Experimental results on a real-world DDS deployment show that Adapdex achieves up to 3x query performance improvement compared to traditional static indexing approaches.
