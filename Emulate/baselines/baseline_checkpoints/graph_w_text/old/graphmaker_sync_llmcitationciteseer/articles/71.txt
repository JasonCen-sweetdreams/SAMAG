This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Our approach enables agents to selectively focus on relevant communication channels and reason about the decision-making processes of other agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN-MARL in a series of cooperative and competitive environments, showcasing improved coordination and adaptability. Furthermore, we provide visualizations and feature importance analysis to facilitate understanding of the learned attention mechanisms.
