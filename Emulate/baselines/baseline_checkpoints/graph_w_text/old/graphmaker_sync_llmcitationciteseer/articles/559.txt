Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has seen significant progress in recent years, but scaling to large, complex environments remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture, which leverages both local and global graph structural information to improve coordination among agents. We demonstrate the efficacy of HGAT in several cooperative MARL benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in environments with varying levels of partial observability. Our analysis reveals that HGAT's hierarchical attention mechanism enables more effective information sharing and coordination among agents, leading to improved overall team performance.
