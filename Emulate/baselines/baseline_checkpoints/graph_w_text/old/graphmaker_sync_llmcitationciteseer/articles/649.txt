Query expansion has been widely adopted in information retrieval systems to improve search relevance. However, the computational overhead of adapting to diverse query types and user preferences can be substantial. This paper presents an adaptive thresholding approach, 'AdaThresh', which dynamically adjusts the expansion term weighting based on the query's semantic complexity. By leveraging a probabilistic modeling of query-term relationships, AdaThresh achieves significant reductions in computational cost while maintaining retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed IR system demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving search efficiency and accuracy.
