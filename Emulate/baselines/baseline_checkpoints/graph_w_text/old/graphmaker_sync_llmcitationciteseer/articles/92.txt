In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects overall system performance. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in real-time. We propose a decentralized Q-network architecture that enables each agent to learn its own task selection policy based on local observations and limited communication with neighboring agents. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
