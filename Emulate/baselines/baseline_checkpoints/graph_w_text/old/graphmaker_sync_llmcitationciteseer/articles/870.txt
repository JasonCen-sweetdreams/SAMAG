Ad-hoc retrieval tasks require effective query representation to retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a neural query expansion approach, 'NQE-DPR', which leverages dense passage retrieval to generate context-aware query embeddings. We introduce a novel attention mechanism to selectively incorporate relevant passage information into the query representation. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that NQE-DPR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including traditional query expansion techniques and neural ranking models, in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
