Virtual reality (VR) has vast potential for immersive experiences, but user engagement remains a significant concern. This study investigates the role of emotive avatars in enhancing user engagement in VR. We designed an experiment with 120 participants, who interacted with either an emotive or neutral avatar in a VR environment. Results show that users who interacted with emotive avatars reported higher levels of engagement, presence, and enjoyment compared to those with neutral avatars. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the emotional expressiveness of avatars influences user behavior, with users more likely to exhibit prosocial behavior towards avatars that display empathy. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems, highlighting the importance of emotive avatars in fostering user engagement.
