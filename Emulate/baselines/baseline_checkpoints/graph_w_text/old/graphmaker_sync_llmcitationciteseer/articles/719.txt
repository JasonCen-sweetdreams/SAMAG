Decentralized task allocation is a critical problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must coordinate to accomplish complex tasks without a centralized controller. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to learn decentralized task allocation policies. We design a multi-agent environment where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities and the task requirements. Our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and agent utilization. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of our algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness in a variety of scenarios.
