Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel neural query graph embedding (NQGE) approach that leverages graph convolutional networks to model query semantics and expand queries with relevant terms. Our approach, dubbed 'QueryGNN', learns to encode queries as dense graph representations, enabling efficient computation of query-term similarities. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for ambiguous queries, and outperform state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
