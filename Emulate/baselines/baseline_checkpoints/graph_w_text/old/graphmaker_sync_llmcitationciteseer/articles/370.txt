Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, who interacted with a VR platform using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, improved sense of presence, and enhanced emotional responses. We also identify key design factors that influence user experience, including avatar realism, customization options, and feedback mechanisms.
