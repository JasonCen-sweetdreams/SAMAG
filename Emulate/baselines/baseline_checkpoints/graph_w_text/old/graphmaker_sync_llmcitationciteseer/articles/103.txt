Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) framework for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our approach incorporates multi-scale temporal attention mechanisms to identify anomalies at different resolutions. We introduce a novel attention-based feature importance scheme to provide interpretable explanations for detected anomalies. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while providing insightful feature attributions.
