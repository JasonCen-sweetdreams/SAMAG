Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in complex decision-making tasks, but its opaqueness hinders trust and understanding. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates explainability into DRL. Our approach uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant state features and actions, providing a transparent and interpretable decision-making process. Experimental results on several Atari games demonstrate that our HAN-based DRL agent achieves competitive performance while providing insightful visualizations of its decision-making process.
