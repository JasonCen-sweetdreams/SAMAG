Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally. However, query optimization remains a challenging task in these systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the system's current workload and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and system throughput.
