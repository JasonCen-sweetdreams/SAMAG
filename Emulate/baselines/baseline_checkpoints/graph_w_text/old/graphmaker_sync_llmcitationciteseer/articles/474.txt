Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including predictive maintenance, healthcare, and finance. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'DAVAD', which leverages the strengths of variational autoencoders (VAEs) and deep neural networks to detect anomalies in multivariate time-series data. DAVAD uses a hierarchical VAE to model the complex temporal dependencies and correlations in the data, while a auxiliary network identifies anomalies based on the reconstruction error. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAVAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to outliers.
