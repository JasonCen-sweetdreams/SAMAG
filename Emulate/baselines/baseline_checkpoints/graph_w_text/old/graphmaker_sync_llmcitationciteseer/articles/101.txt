Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but selecting the most effective expansion terms remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion policies. Our method, dubbed 'QERL', employs a neural agent that learns to select expansion terms by interacting with a simulated retrieval environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QERL on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods. Our results suggest that reinforcement learning can be a powerful tool for optimizing IR systems.
