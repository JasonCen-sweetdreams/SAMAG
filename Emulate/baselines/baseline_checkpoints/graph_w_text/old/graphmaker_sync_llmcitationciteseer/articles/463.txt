The growing importance of temporal graph databases in various applications has highlighted the need for efficient indexing techniques. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, 'HBFT', which leverages hierarchical Bloom filters to enable fast query performance and scalable storage for large-scale temporal graph data. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that HBFT outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage reduction.
