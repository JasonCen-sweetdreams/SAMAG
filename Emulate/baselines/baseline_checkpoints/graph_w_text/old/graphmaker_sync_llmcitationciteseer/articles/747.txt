Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR systems often neglect their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for this population. We conducted participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers, identifying key challenges and opportunities for VR-based interventions. Our proposed framework, 'CARE-VR', incorporates cognitive support features, personalized adaptive difficulty, and multimodal feedback to facilitate engagement and accessibility. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in cognitive performance and user satisfaction, highlighting the potential of CARE-VR for promoting healthy aging and social inclusion.
