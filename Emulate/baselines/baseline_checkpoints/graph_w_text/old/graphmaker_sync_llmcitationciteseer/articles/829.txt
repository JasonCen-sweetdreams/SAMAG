As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent in public spaces, it is essential to ensure that these interfaces are accessible and usable by diverse populations. This paper presents a co-design methodology that brings together individuals with disabilities, urban planners, and AR developers to create inclusive AR experiences. We identify key challenges and opportunities in AR design for public spaces, and propose a set of guidelines for creating accessible AR interfaces. Our evaluation of a prototype AR system in a public park demonstrates the effectiveness of our co-design approach in improving user experience and accessibility for individuals with visual and mobility impairments.
