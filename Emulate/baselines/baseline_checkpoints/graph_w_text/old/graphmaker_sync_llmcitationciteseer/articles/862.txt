Hierarchical clustering is a popular unsupervised learning technique, but its scalability is limited by the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepHCluster', which leverages deep neural networks to learn a hierarchical representation of high-dimensional data. Our method employs a stacked denoising autoencoder to reduce dimensionality and a hierarchy-aware loss function to preserve clustering structure. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepHCluster outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and scalability, achieving significant speedups on large datasets.
