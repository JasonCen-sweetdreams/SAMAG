Multi-agent systems often rely on black-box decision-making models, limiting their explainability and trustworthiness. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision-making. HAN integrates attention mechanisms at both the local and global levels, enabling agents to selectively focus on relevant information and communicate effectively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a simulated traffic management scenario, where it outperforms traditional Q-learning and deep reinforcement learning methods in terms of decision-making accuracy and interpretability.
