Query optimization is a critical component of database systems, but traditional optimizers rely on heuristics and empirical models. This paper explores the application of learned index structures to accelerate query optimization. We propose a novel framework, 'Lixi', which leverages machine learning to predict query execution times and optimize plans. Lixi integrates with popular database management systems and outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers on a range of real-world workloads. Our experiments demonstrate that Lixi reduces query latency by up to 3.5x and improves optimization time by up to 2x.
