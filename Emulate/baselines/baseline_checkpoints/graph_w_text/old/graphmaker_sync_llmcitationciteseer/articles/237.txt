Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of optimally allocating resources to meet dynamic workload demands. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'CloudOpt', to address this problem. CloudOpt uses a novel combination of actor-critic methods and graph neural networks to learn resource allocation policies that minimize latency and energy consumption. We evaluate CloudOpt on a real-world cloud dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization and application performance compared to traditional rule-based approaches.
