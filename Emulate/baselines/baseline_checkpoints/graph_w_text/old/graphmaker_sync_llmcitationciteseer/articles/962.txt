This paper presents a novel human-AI collaboration framework, 'CliniXplain', designed to facilitate real-time decision-making in healthcare. Our approach leverages reinforcement learning to optimize AI-driven recommendations, while incorporating human clinicians' feedback to generate transparent and interpretable explanations. We evaluate Clinixplain on a large dataset of electronic health records, demonstrating improved diagnosis accuracy and reduced decision latency compared to traditional AI-only or human-only approaches. Our framework has the potential to revolutionize healthcare decision-making by fostering trust and collaboration between humans and AI systems.
