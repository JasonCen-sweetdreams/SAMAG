In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to agents in a distributed manner. We design a GNN-based task allocation algorithm that incorporates agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. Our approach is evaluated on a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized methods. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the algorithm's convergence and optimality.
