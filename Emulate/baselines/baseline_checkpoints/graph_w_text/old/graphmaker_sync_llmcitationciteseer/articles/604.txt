Voice assistants have transformed the way we interact with technology, but their benefits are not equally accessible to older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyVoice', a voice assistant tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key requirements, such as simplified language processing, personalized feedback, and error tolerance. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and supportive voice assistants for older adults with cognitive impairments.
