In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects the overall system efficiency. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework using reinforcement learning, where autonomous agents learn to allocate tasks based on their local observations and interactions. We introduce a modified Q-learning algorithm that incorporates a novel reward function, which encourages agents to explore and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results in a simulated robotic swarm scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and system robustness.
