Explainable recommendation systems have garnered significant attention in recent years, but most existing methods rely on simplistic feature attribution techniques. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that learns to identify influential user-item interactions and generates personalized explanations for recommendations. Our architecture leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between users, items, and attributes, and hierarchical graph pooling to capture multi-scale dependencies. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art explainable recommendation methods in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
