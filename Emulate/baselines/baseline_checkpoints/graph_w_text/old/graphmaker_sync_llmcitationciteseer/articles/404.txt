Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complex nature of graph queries and the distributed architecture. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach to query optimization, called GraphOpt, which leverages query patterns and graph structural features to predict optimal query plans. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world graph dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and scalability compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
