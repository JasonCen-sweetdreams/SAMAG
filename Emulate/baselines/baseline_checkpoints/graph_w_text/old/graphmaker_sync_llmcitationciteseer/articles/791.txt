Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the database schema as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn a representation of the query plan space. Our approach, called GNN-QO, outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time on a variety of real-world datasets. We also demonstrate the scalability of GNN-QO on large-scale distributed datasets.
