Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent in smart home devices, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing accessible conversational interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed design framework incorporates simplification strategies, multimodal output, and cognitive support features, which were evaluated through a usability study with 20 participants. Results show significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction, highlighting the potential of accessible conversational interfaces to enhance independence and quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments.
