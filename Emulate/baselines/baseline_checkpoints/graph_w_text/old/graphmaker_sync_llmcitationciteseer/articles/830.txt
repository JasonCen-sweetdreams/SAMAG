Ad-hoc search systems struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep learning-based contextualized embeddings to better capture semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, 'ConEx', uses a fine-tuned BERT model to generate contextualized embeddings for query terms and expands the query using a learned weighting scheme. Experiments on several TREC benchmarks demonstrate that ConEx significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving an average improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision.
