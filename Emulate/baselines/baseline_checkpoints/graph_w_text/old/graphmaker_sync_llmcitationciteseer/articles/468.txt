Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies in time-series data while providing explainable insights. Our approach leverages multi-scale feature extraction, attention-based feature weighting, and a hierarchical aggregation mechanism to capture complex temporal patterns. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and explainability.
