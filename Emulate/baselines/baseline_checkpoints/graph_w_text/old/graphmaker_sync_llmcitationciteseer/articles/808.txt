Time-series data indexing is a crucial component in various applications, including financial analysis, IoT, and healthcare. Existing indexing methods often suffer from high query latency, poor storage efficiency, or limited scalability. This paper presents a novel segment-based indexing approach, dubbed 'SegIndex', which adaptively partitions time-series data into segments based on their statistical properties. SegIndex leverages a combination of compact binary representations and hierarchical indexing to achieve significant improvements in query performance and storage efficiency. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that SegIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 30% in query latency and 25% in storage reduction.
