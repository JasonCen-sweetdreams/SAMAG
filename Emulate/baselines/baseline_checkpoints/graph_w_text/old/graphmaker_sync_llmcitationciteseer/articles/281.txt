Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in DDS due to the complexity of data distribution and node heterogeneity. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DistroOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and graph-based query decomposition. DistroOpt achieves up to 3x performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers on real-world datasets. We also conduct a thorough analysis of the impact of data skew and node variability on query optimization and provide insights for future research.
