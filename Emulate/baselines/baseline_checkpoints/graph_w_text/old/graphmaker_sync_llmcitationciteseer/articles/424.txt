Multi-agent systems have become increasingly prevalent in various application domains, including robotics, smart cities, and IoT. Effective task allocation is crucial to ensure efficient and scalable operation of these systems. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic environment conditions and agent capabilities. Our approach, called 'RL-TA', utilizes a multi-agent Q-network to learn optimal task assignment strategies, taking into account agent resources, task priorities, and communication constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-TA outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and system robustness.
