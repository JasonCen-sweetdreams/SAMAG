Few-shot image classification remains a challenging task in machine learning, particularly when dealing with novel classes. This paper presents a hierarchical meta-learning framework, 'HML-Net', which leverages the strengths of both episodic and incremental learning. The proposed approach consists of a hierarchical neural network that learns to adapt to new tasks by generating task-specific weights and biases. We evaluate HML-Net on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.
