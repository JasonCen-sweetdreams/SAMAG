Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of expression across modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features to improve emotion recognition accuracy. Our HAN model consists of a modality-aware attention mechanism and a feature-aware attention mechanism, which are jointly trained to capture both intra-modal and inter-modal relationships. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal data.
