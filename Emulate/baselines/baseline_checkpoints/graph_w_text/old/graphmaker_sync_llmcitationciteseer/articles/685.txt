Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often pose significant barriers to accessibility for this user group. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CogniVR', a novel VR interface tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. Our approach incorporates simplification, consistency, and error prevention strategies to reduce cognitive load and facilitate user engagement. A user study with 20 participants revealed significant improvements in task completion rates, user satisfaction, and cognitive workload compared to a standard VR interface.
