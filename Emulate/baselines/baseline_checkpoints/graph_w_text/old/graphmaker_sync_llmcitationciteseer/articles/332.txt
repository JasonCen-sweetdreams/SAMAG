The rise of virtual reality (VR) technology has led to increased interest in understanding user behavior and engagement in immersive environments. This study explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience and interaction in VR. We designed an experiment using a VR platform, where participants were randomly assigned to either a personalized avatar or a generic one. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, motivation, and overall satisfaction compared to those with generic avatars. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR systems and highlight avenues for future research.
