Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or under-specified queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to capture semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our model learns to generate context-aware expansion terms by jointly optimizing a ranking loss function and a regularization term that promotes diversity in the expanded query. Experimental results on several standard TREC datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving up to 15% improvement in mean average precision.
