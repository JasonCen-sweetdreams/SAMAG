In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. This paper introduces HAT-MAD, a novel hierarchical attention network architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent scenarios. HAT-MAD learns to attend to relevant agents and their interactions, generating interpretable attention weights that reveal the underlying decision-making process. We evaluate HAT-MAD on a range of multi-agent environments, demonstrating improved decision-making performance and enhanced explainability compared to existing approaches.
