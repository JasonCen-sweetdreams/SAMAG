Traditional vector space models in information retrieval (IR) systems suffer from high dimensionality, leading to inefficient query processing and suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel hierarchical embedding approach, 'HyIER', which represents documents and queries as nested, hierarchical structures. By leveraging the inherent semantic relationships between query terms and document contents, HyIER reduces the dimensionality of the vector space while preserving the underlying semantic information. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art IR models.
