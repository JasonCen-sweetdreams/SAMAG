Query expansion techniques are crucial in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but often suffer from high computational complexity and suboptimal term selection. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document embedding framework, 'HDQE', which captures semantic relationships between terms and documents at multiple granularities. We demonstrate that HDQE can effectively reduce the dimensionality of the term space, leading to significant speedups in query expansion and improved retrieval performance. Experiments on several TREC datasets show that HDQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of MAP and NDCG scores, while requiring fewer computational resources.
