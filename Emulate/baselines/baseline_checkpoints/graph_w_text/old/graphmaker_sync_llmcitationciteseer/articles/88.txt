Explainable recommendation systems aim to provide transparent and interpretable models for user-item interactions. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships. HGAT employs a hierarchical structure to capture both local and global patterns in user behavior, enabling the generation of personalized and context-aware explanations for recommendations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
