Cross-domain sentiment analysis (CDSA) aims to adapt a sentiment model trained on one domain to another domain with limited labeled data. Existing approaches often rely on manual feature engineering or domain-invariant representations, neglecting the intrinsic differences between domains. We propose a meta-learning framework, 'MetaAlign', which learns to adapt to new domains by aligning the domain-specific distributions. Our approach leverages a novel adversarial objective to simultaneously learn domain-invariant and domain-specific representations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MetaAlign outperforms state-of-the-art methods in CDSA tasks, especially when faced with domain shifts.
