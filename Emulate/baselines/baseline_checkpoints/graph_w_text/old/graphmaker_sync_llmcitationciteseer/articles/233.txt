Knowledge graph construction is a crucial task in various applications, including question answering and recommender systems. However, entity disambiguation remains a significant bottleneck in this process. We propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to disambiguate entities in a scalable manner. Our method, 'GNN-ED', exploits the structural properties of the knowledge graph and learns to represent entities as dense vectors. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GNN-ED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability, particularly for large-scale knowledge graphs.
