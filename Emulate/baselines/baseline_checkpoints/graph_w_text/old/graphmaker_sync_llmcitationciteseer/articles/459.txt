Query expansion is a crucial technique for enhancing the effectiveness of information retrieval systems. However, traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not fully capture the complexities of natural language queries. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn query expansion representations. We employ a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query representation, expansion, and ranking tasks. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving substantial improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
