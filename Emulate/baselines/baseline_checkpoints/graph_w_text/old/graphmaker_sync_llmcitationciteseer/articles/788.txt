Temporal graphs are increasingly used to model complex relationships in various domains, including social networks, finance, and recommendation systems. Real-time analytics on such graphs is crucial for timely insights, but existing indexing techniques are limited by their scalability and query performance. This paper presents 'TG-Index', a novel indexing framework that leverages graph summarization, incremental indexing, and parallel query processing to support real-time analytics on large-scale temporal graphs. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate TG-Index's ability to reduce query latency by up to 5x and indexing time by up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art methods.
