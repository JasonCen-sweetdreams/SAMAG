Explainable time series forecasting is crucial in various domains, such as finance and healthcare. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to capture complex temporal dependencies. Our approach leverages a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify salient features and assign attention weights, enabling the model to focus on relevant segments of the time series. We evaluate our HAN model on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
