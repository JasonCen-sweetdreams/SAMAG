Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for applications like predictive maintenance and fault detection. However, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAT) that detects anomalies while providing explainable results. HAT uses a hierarchical architecture to capture complex temporal patterns and attention mechanisms to identify relevant features contributing to anomalies. Our experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy while providing meaningful insights into anomaly causes.
