Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but selecting the most informative terms remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion. Our method, 'RL-QE', learns to predict the relevance of expansion terms based on user feedback and rewards the agent for improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC_CLIP dataset demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision. We also show that RL-QE adapts effectively to varying query types and domain shifts.
