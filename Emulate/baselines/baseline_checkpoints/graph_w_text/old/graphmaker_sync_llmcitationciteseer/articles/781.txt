As Virtual Reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly popular, ensuring secure authentication in immersive environments is crucial. This paper proposes a novel gaze-based authentication system, 'GazeSecure', which utilizes deep learning to analyze users' eye movements in VR. Our approach leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from gaze patterns and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model sequential gaze behavior. Experimental results on a dataset of 100 users demonstrate that GazeSecure achieves a high authentication accuracy of 95.6% and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. We discuss the implications of our approach for enhancing VR security and its potential applications in various domains.
