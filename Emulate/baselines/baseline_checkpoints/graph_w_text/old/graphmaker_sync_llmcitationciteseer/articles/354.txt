Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but existing VR systems often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents 'AccessVR', a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual impairments. We introduce a set of guidelines and tools for creating 3D audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and cognitive load management. Our user study with 20 participants demonstrates that AccessVR significantly improves navigation efficiency and reduces cognitive load for users with visual impairments, paving the way for more accessible VR experiences.
