Traditional keyword-based search engines often struggle to capture complex semantic relationships between documents. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture for document ranking, which models documents as nodes in a hierarchical graph and learns to propagate relevance scores between them. Our approach leverages both local and global graph structure to capture nuanced contextual relationships, outperforming state-of-the-art neural ranking models on several benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate the scalability of our approach by experimenting on a large-scale web corpus.
