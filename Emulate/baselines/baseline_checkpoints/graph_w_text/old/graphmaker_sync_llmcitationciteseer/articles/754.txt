This paper explores the potential of query-driven document expansion to enhance retrieval effectiveness in ad-hoc search. We propose a novel expansion framework, 'DocExpan', which leverages contextualized language models to identify and incorporate relevant terms from the query context into the document representation. Our approach is designed to handle the vocabulary mismatch problem by learning to expand documents in a way that is query-dependent. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short queries and rare terms.
