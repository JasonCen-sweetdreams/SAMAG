Zero-shot learning (ZSL) has gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing methods rely on predefined attributes or semantic embeddings, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that learns to adapt to unseen classes without requiring additional annotations. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between seen and unseen classes, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ZSL methods, achieving significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
