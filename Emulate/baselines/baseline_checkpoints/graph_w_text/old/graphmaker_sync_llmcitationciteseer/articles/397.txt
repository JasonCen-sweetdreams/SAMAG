Real-time data warehousing has become a critical component of modern analytics, requiring fast query processing and efficient data storage. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework that leverages column-store indexing to accelerate query performance in real-time data warehousing environments. We propose a cost-based optimization algorithm that takes into account the unique characteristics of column-store indexes, such as compression and storage efficiency. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements in query execution time and storage utilization compared to traditional row-store indexing methods.
