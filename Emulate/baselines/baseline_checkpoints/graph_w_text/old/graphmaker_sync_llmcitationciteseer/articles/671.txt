In large-scale multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective objectives. This paper presents a novel framework for coordinated task allocation, which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize agent assignments in heterogeneous environments. Our approach, called 'HetMAL', considers varying agent capabilities and task requirements, and learns to adapt to changing system dynamics through online exploration. Experimental results in simulated scenarios demonstrate that HetMAL outperforms traditional auction-based methods, achieving significant improvements in overall system performance and robustness.
