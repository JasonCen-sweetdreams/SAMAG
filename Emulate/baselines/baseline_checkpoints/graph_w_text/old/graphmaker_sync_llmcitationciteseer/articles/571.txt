In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). Our approach, called Decent-TA, enables agents to learn to allocate tasks in a distributed manner, without relying on a central authority. We employ a novel MARL algorithm that leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and learn effective task allocation policies. Experimental results demonstrate that Decent-TA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to changing environments.
