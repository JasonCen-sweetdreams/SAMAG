Query optimization is a critical component of database systems, as it directly impacts performance and latency. In distributed database systems, query optimization becomes even more challenging due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We design a DRL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database environment and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Our experimental results on a distributed database benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while achieving near-optimal query plans.
