Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and system scalability. Traditional query optimizers rely on heuristics and static cost models, which can lead to suboptimal plans. We propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called QOPT-RL, uses a deep Q-network to learn a query plan policy that adapts to changing system conditions and workload patterns. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that QOPT-RL outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, achieving up to 30% improvement in query execution time and 25% reduction in resource utilization.
