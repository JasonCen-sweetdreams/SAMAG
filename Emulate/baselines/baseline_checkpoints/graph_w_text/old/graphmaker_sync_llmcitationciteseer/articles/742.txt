Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of life, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework that incorporates multisensory cues and haptic feedback to enhance accessibility for visually impaired users. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that our proposed framework improved navigation and task completion times by 35% compared to standard VR interfaces. Our results have important implications for the development of inclusive VR systems that can benefit a broader range of users.
