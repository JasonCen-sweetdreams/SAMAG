Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in meta-learning, as existing methods often struggle to adapt to novel tasks with limited data. This paper proposes a hierarchical meta-learning framework, 'TaskAware', that leverages task-aware adaptation to improve few-shot classification performance. Our approach involves a hierarchical neural network that learns to adapt to new tasks by generating task-specific weights and attention masks. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TaskAware outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness.
