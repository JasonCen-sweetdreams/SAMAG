Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-structured data, where the goal is to classify new nodes with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that exploits both local and global graph structures to learn transferable node representations. HGAN consists of a hierarchical graph attention mechanism that adaptively selects relevant nodes and a meta-learning framework that fine-tunes the model for few-shot classification. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in achieving state-of-the-art performance on few-shot node classification tasks.
