Coordinating multiple agents in real-world applications often requires balancing individual goals with collective objectives. We propose a novel framework, 'GraphAttention-MARL', which leverages reinforcement learning and graph attention mechanisms to learn effective coordination strategies. Our approach enables agents to adapt to changing graph structures and learn to focus on relevant neighbors, leading to improved coordination and enhanced overall system performance. Experimental results on a decentralized traffic control scenario demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in reducing congestion and improving overall traffic flow.
