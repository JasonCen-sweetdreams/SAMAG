Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often struggle to balance precision and recall. This paper proposes a novel neural re-ranking approach, 'NeurEx', which leverages BERT-based language models to learn contextualized representations of query terms and documents. We introduce a two-stage re-ranking framework that first generates a set of candidate expansions using a neural query encoder, and then re-ranks the expanded query using a neural document scorer. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that NeurEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in both precision and recall.
