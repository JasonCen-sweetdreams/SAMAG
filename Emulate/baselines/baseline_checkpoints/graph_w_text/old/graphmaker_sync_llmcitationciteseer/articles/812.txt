In multi-agent systems, trust is a critical component for effective coordination. However, agents may deceive others to achieve their own goals. This paper presents a novel approach to deception-resistant multi-agent coordination, where agents adaptively model trust based on observable behavior. We introduce a probabilistic trust model that incorporates uncertainty and temporal dependencies, allowing agents to detect and respond to deceptive behavior. Experimental results in a simulated rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach leads to improved coordination and reduced deception compared to traditional trust-based methods.
