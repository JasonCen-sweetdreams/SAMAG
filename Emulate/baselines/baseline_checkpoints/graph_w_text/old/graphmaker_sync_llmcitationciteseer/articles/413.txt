As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, gaze-based interaction has emerged as a promising modality for intuitive user input. This paper presents a comprehensive study on user experience and eye movement patterns in VR environments. We designed a novel gaze-based interaction system that utilizes machine learning-based gaze estimation and evaluate its performance in a series of user experiments. Our results show that the proposed system achieves high accuracy and user satisfaction, while also revealing interesting insights into eye movement patterns and their correlation with user behavior. The findings of this study have significant implications for the design of gaze-based interfaces in VR applications.
