The proliferation of graph-structured data has led to a growing need for efficient query processing in distributed graph databases. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization and machine learning-based cost estimation to minimize query latency. We introduce a distributed, adaptive caching mechanism that dynamically adjusts to changing query patterns, reducing the number of network transmissions and improving overall system throughput. Experimental results on a large-scale social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
