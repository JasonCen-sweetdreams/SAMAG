This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using evolutionary game theory. We model the task allocation problem as a repeated game, where agents learn to adapt their strategies based on their past experiences. We propose a novel algorithm, 'EvoTask', which utilizes a genetic algorithm to evolve the task allocation strategies of agents. Our approach ensures that the system converges to a stable Nash equilibrium, leading to efficient task allocation and improved system performance. We evaluate the proposed framework using a simulated multi-agent system and demonstrate its effectiveness in various scenarios.
