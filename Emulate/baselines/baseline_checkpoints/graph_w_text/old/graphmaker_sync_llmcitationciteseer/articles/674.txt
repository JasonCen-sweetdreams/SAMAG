Neural search engines have gained popularity due to their ability to capture semantic relationships between queries and documents. However, they often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, where the query lacks relevant keywords. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'DAE-QE', which leverages denoising autoencoders to generate synthetic queries that capture the underlying intent of the original query. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAE-QE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, leading to significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency.
