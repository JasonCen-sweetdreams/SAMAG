This paper addresses the problem of coordinating heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have different capabilities, constraints, and objectives. We propose a decentralized graph-based planning approach, which leverages graph neural networks to learn a coordination graph that captures the interactions and dependencies between agents. Our approach, called Dec-GCP, enables agents to make decentralized decisions while ensuring global optimality. We evaluate Dec-GCP in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved response times and resource allocation compared to centralized planning methods.
