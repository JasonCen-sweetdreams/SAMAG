Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework that incorporates both user-item interactions and item attributes to generate personalized explanations for recommendations. Our approach leverages a hierarchical graph structure to model complex relationships between users, items, and attributes, and employs attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant information. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality, providing insights into the decision-making process.
