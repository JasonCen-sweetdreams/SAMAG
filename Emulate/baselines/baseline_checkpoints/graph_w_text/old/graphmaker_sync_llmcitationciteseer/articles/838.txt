Natural language search has become increasingly popular, but query ambiguity and underspecification remain significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach to query reformulation using hierarchical semantic role labeling (HSRL). Our method first identifies the semantic roles in the query and then generates a set of reformulated queries by traversing the HSRL graph. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale dataset of natural language queries and show significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art query reformulation techniques. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating semantic role information in natural language search.
