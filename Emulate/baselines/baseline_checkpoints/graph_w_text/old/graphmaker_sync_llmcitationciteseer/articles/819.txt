Autonomous agents in complex systems often need to allocate tasks efficiently to achieve global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to resolve conflicts and ensure feasibility. Our approach, called DCAgent, enables agents to negotiate and adapt to changing constraints using a hybrid of message-passing and local search. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DCAgent outperforms centralized methods in terms of both solution quality and communication overhead.
