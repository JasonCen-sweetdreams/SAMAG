Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in solving complex cooperative tasks. However, the lack of interpretability in MARL models hinders their adoption in real-world applications. We propose Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) to address this issue. HANs employ a hierarchical structure to model agent interactions and incorporate attention mechanisms to focus on relevant agents and actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HANs in a cooperative robot navigation task, achieving improved performance and providing insights into agent decision-making processes through attention visualization.
