Gamification has been increasingly used to enhance user engagement in various domains, including education. However, its effectiveness in virtual reality (VR)-based learning environments remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the impact of gamification on user engagement in VR-based learning environments using a mixed-methods approach. We designed and developed a VR-based learning platform with gamification elements and conducted a user study with 30 participants. Our results show that gamification significantly increases user engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes in VR-based learning environments. We also identify key design implications for incorporating gamification in VR-based learning environments.
