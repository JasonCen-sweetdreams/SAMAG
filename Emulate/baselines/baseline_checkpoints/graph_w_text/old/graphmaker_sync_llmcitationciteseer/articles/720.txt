Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to capture the semantic nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural embeddings to better model keyword relationships. Our method, 'NeuroQE', uses a pre-trained language model to generate contextualized embeddings for query terms, which are then used to expand the original query. We evaluate NeuroQE on several benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries. Furthermore, we show that NeuroQE can be efficiently integrated into existing retrieval systems, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.
