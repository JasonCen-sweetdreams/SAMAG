Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. We design a customized reward function that balances query latency and resource utilization, and train a deep Q-network to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
