Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering and simplistic weighting schemes. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'DeepQE', which learns to optimize query expansion policies in an end-to-end manner. By formulating query expansion as a Markov decision process, our approach can effectively balance the trade-off between query drift and term importance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
