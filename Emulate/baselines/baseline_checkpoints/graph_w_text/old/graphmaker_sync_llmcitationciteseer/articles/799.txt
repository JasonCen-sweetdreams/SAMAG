Virtual reality (VR) has shown immense potential in various domains, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR interfaces. We design and develop an avatar customization framework that incorporates users' physical and personality traits, and conduct a user study with 50 participants. Our results indicate that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, reduced cognitive load, and improved overall satisfaction. We also identify key factors influencing user preferences for avatar customization and discuss implications for VR interface design.
