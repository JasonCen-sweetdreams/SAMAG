Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn effective task allocation strategies in a decentralized manner. Our approach, called DRL-TA, uses a multi-agent deep Q-network to learn a task allocation policy that maximizes the global reward. We evaluate DRL-TA on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate its ability to outperform traditional decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
