Multi-tenancy is a common architecture in cloud databases, where a single database instance serves multiple tenants. However, query optimization in such systems becomes challenging due to the varying workload patterns and resource contention among tenants. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'TenantAware', which leverages machine learning-based predictions to adapt to changing tenant workloads. We introduce a hierarchical optimization approach that balances query performance and resource allocation across tenants, while minimizing overhead and ensuring fairness. Experimental results on a real-world cloud database show that TenantAware outperforms existing optimization techniques by up to 30% in query response time and 25% in resource utilization.
