Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data processing. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while ensuring optimal resource utilization.
