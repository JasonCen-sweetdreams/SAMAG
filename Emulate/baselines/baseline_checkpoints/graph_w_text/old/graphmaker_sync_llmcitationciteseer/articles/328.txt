Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. We design a deep reinforcement learning framework that learns to predict optimal query plans based on the database schema, query workload, and system performance metrics. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
