In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to agents with varying capabilities and preferences. We model the agent-agent and agent-task interactions as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn a robust and adaptive allocation policy. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized methods in terms of task completion rate and system utility.
