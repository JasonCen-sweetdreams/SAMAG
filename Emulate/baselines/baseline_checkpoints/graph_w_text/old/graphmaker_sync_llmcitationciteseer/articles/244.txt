Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for storing and managing large-scale datasets. However, query processing in such systems remains a significant challenge due to the need to coordinate data access across multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing scheme, 'HierIndex', which leverages a combination of local and global indices to optimize query execution. HierIndex dynamically adapts to changing data distributions and query patterns, minimizing communication overhead and improving query response times. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HierIndex outperforms existing indexing schemes in terms of query latency and throughput.
