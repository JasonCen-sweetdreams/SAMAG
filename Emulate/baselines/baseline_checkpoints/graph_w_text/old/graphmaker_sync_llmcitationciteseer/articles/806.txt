Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distribution and fragmentation. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plan from a large state space of possible plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization. We also demonstrate the scalability and adaptability of our approach to varying database workloads and configurations.
