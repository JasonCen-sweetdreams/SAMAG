Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the heterogeneous nature of the inputs. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features to improve emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of three levels of attention: modality-level, feature-level, and token-level, enabling it to capture both global and local dependencies in the input data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
