Explainability is a critical aspect of autonomous systems, particularly in high-stakes applications like robotics and self-driving cars. This paper presents a novel framework for planning and execution in autonomous systems, centered around hierarchical task networks (HTNs). Our approach leverages HTNs to generate explainable plans that can be easily understood by humans, while also incorporating symbolic planning and reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on a robotic grasping task, showing improved plan interpretability and execution performance.
