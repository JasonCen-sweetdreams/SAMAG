Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the most efficient query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
