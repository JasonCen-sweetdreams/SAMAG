The increasing volume and complexity of time-series data necessitate accurate and interpretable anomaly detection methods. This paper introduces Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs), a novel deep learning architecture that leverages multi-scale temporal attention to identify anomalies in time-series data. HANs utilize a hierarchical encoder to extract features at varying resolutions, and a attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant segments. We demonstrate the efficacy of HANs on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing visual explanations for detected anomalies.
