Query reformulation is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it helps to refine the search query and improve the relevance of retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel document expansion technique, called 'DocExpan', which leverages a combination of semantic and syntactic features to identify relevant expansion terms. We demonstrate that DocExpan outperforms existing query reformulation methods in terms of precision and recall, particularly for ambiguous and underspecified queries. Our approach is computationally efficient and can be easily integrated into existing search engines, making it a promising solution for real-world information retrieval applications.
