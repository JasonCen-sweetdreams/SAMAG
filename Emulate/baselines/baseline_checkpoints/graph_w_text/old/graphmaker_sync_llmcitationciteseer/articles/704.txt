Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it significantly impacts the retrieval performance. Traditional methods rely on manual rules or statistical models, which may not capture the complexity of natural language queries. We propose a novel approach, 'NeuralQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn query expansion from large-scale datasets. Our model consists of a query encoder, a term selector, and a ranking module. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuralQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, while reducing the computational cost.
