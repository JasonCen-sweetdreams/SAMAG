Query optimization is a critical component of relational databases, but traditional approaches often struggle with distributed databases. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workloads and database configurations. Our approach, 'RL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy for selecting optimal query plans, considering factors such as data distribution, network latency, and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate that RL-QO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving up to 3x speedup in query execution time.
