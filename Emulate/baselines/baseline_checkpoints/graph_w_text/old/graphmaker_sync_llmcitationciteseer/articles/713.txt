Multi-agent systems often require autonomous negotiation strategies to achieve mutually beneficial agreements in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a novel framework, 'Adaptive Negotiator', which leverages machine learning and game theory to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Our approach incorporates a hybrid negotiation strategy that combines concession-based and learning-based tactics, allowing agents to adjust their negotiation policies in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive Negotiator outperforms traditional negotiation strategies in simulated scenarios with varying levels of uncertainty and complexity.
