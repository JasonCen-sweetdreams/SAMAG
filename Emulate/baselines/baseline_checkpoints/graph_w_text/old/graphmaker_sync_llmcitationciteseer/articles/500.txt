Few-shot node classification in graph-structured data has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, existing methods typically rely on meta-learning or episodic training, which can be computationally expensive and prone to overfitting. We propose a Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to adaptively weight neighboring nodes and their features. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including Cora and Citeseer, while requiring fewer parameters and computational resources compared to existing methods.
