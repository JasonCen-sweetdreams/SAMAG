Conversational AI systems have become ubiquitous, but their ability to establish trust with users remains a major concern. This paper explores the impact of anthropomorphic design elements on user trust in conversational AI. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants, where we manipulated the level of anthropomorphism in a chatbot's visual design and dialogue. Our results show that users perceive anthropomorphized chatbots as more trustworthy, but only when the level of anthropomorphism is moderate. Overly human-like designs can lead to mistrust due to uncanny valley effects. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of conversational AI systems that balance user trust with user experience.
