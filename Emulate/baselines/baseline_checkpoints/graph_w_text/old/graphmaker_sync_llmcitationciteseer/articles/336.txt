Real-time traffic management is critical for mitigating congestion and reducing travel times in urban areas. This paper presents a novel framework for autonomous agent coordination, 'SmartTraffic', which leverages decentralized decision-making to optimize traffic signal control. Our approach combines graph-based modeling of traffic networks with multi-agent reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions. Experimental results using real-world traffic data demonstrate that SmartTraffic reduces average travel times by 23% and decreases congestion by 17% compared to traditional fixed-time signal control. We also explore the scalability and robustness of our approach in various urban scenarios.
