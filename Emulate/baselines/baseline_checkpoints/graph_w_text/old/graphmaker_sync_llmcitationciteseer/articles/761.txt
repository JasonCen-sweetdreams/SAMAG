Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and high-performance computing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization technique using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plan. Our approach adapts to the dynamic nature of the distributed database system and outperforms traditional rule-based optimization techniques by up to 30%. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
