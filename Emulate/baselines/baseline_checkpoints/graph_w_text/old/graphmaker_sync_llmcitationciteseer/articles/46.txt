Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process of AI models. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture, which leverages both item-level and user-level attention mechanisms to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. Our approach improves upon state-of-the-art recommendation models by incorporating explicit explanations, enhancing model transparency and user trust. Experimental results on real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
