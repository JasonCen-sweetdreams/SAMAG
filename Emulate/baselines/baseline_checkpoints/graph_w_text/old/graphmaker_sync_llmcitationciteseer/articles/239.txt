Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human life, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We conducted a mixed-methods study, involving both quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews, to investigate how users perceive and interact with personalized avatars. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly improve user engagement, particularly among users with high levels of self-identity. We also identify key design factors, such as anthropomorphism and customization, that influence user experience. The findings of this study can inform the design of more effective and engaging VR systems.
