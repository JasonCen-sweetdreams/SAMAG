Effective negotiation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents must balance individual goals with global optimality. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'DeepNegotiate', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to train autonomous negotiation agents. Our approach combines multi-agent Q-learning with graph neural networks to model complex dependencies between agents and their negotiation strategies. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that DeepNegotiate outperforms traditional negotiation protocols, achieving higher joint rewards and improved Pareto optimality. We discuss implications for real-world applications, such as automated supply chain management and smart grid energy trading.
