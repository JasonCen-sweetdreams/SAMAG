Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their accessibility features often overlook the needs of older adults. This paper presents a mixed-methods study on designing inclusive voice assistants, focusing on the accessibility requirements of older adults. We conducted contextual inquiries with 20 older adults and identified key pain points, such as difficulties with speech recognition, lack of visual feedback, and limited customization options. Based on these findings, we designed and prototyped an accessible voice assistant, 'EasyVoice', which incorporates features like real-time transcription, personalized speech recognition, and simplified navigation. Our user study with 15 older adults showed significant improvements in usability and user satisfaction with EasyVoice compared to commercial voice assistants.
