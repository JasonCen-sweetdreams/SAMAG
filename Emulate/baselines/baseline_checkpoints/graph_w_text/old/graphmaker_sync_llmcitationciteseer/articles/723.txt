Query optimization is a critical component of relational databases, as it directly impacts query performance and system scalability. However, traditional query optimization techniques struggle to cope with the complexities of distributed databases. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RLOpt', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed relational databases. RLOpt uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan from a vast search space, considering factors such as data distribution, network latency, and resource utilization. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database setup demonstrates that RLOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of system throughput.
