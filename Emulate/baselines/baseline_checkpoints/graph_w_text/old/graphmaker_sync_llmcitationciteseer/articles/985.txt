Voice assistants have become an integral part of our daily lives, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to improve the accessibility of voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, identifying key challenges and opportunities for inclusive design. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant interface that incorporates visual and tactile cues, simplifies task flows, and provides personalized feedback. A usability study with 30 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction, highlighting the potential of participatory design in creating more inclusive HCI systems.
