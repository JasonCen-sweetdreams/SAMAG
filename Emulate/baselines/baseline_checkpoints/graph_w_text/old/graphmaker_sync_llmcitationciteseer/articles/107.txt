Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must allocate tasks to maximize overall system efficiency. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn probabilistic policies for task assignment. Our approach, called 'Dec-TARL', uses a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn a joint policy that adaptively allocates tasks based on agent capabilities, task priorities, and system constraints. Experiments on a simulated robotic warehouse environment demonstrate that Dec-TARL outperforms traditional decentralized allocation methods, achieving a 25% increase in system throughput and a 30% reduction in task completion time.
