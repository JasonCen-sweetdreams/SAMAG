Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to scale and handle large amounts of data. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, called QOpt-RL, uses an RL agent to learn the optimal execution plan for a given query by interacting with the DDS environment. We evaluate QOpt-RL on a real-world dataset and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time.
