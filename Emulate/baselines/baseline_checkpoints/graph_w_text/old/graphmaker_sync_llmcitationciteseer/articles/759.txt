Materialized views are essential for improving query performance in distributed database systems. However, maintaining their consistency in the presence of frequent data updates is a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel, adaptive maintenance strategy that leverages incremental view maintenance and data partitioning. Our approach, called 'AdaptView', dynamically adjusts the maintenance frequency and data granularity based on workload patterns and system resources. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AdaptView reduces maintenance costs by up to 40% while ensuring query freshness and accuracy.
