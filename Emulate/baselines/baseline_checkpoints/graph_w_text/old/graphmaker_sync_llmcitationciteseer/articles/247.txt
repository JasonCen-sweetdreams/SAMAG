Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on a reward function that balances execution time and resource utilization. Our evaluation on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrates that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and reduces resource consumption by up to 25%. We also provide insights into the learned policy and its applicability to various DDS configurations.
