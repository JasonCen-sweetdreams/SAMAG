Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems to improve the retrieval performance. Traditional methods rely on term frequency-based approaches, which may not capture the semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep contextualized embeddings to model the semantic context of query terms. We employ a graph-based attention mechanism to integrate the embeddings with the query graph, enabling the capture of nuanced relationships between terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
