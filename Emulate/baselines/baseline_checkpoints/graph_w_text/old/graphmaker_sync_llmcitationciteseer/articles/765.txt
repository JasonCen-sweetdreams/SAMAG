Clinical text retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture the nuances of medical terminology, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroClin', which leverages neural embeddings to better represent semantic relationships between clinical concepts. By integrating a domain-specific language model with a robust query expansion framework, NeuroClin achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for complex and multi-concept queries. Experimental results on a large clinical corpus demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in enhancing the accuracy and relevance of search results.
