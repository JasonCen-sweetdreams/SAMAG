Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular in modern data processing systems. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and network latency. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'QLearning', which leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select the most efficient query execution plan. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and utilize deep Q-networks to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that QLearning outperforms traditional query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
