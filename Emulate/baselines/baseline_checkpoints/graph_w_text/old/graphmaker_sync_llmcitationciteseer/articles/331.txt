The proliferation of fake news on social media has severe consequences for individuals and society. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture for explainable fake news detection. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between news articles, users, and propagation patterns. We introduce a hierarchical framework that recursively applies attention to capture local and global patterns, enabling the model to identify influential nodes and explain its detection decisions. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both detection accuracy and explainability.
