Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, but traditional methods often rely on manual iteration and suffer from term mismatch. We propose a neural approach, 'DocEmb-EXP', which leverages document embeddings to automatically identify relevant expansion terms. Our model learns to project documents and queries into a shared semantic space, enabling efficient and effective query expansion. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, with an average increase of 12.5% in NDCG@20 compared to state-of-the-art methods.
