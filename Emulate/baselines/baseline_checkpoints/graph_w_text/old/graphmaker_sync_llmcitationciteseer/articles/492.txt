Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems often struggle to capture the nuances of medical terminology, leading to suboptimal query results. We propose a novel query expansion approach, MedExpand, which leverages hierarchical embeddings to model the semantic relationships between medical entities. By recursively expanding the query through a hierarchical graph, MedExpand improves the retrieval of relevant documents. We evaluate our approach on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset, demonstrating a significant increase in precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
