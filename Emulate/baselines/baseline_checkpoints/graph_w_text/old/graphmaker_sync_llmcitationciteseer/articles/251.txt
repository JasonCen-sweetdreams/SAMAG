This paper proposes a novel approach to cooperative task allocation for autonomous agents using deep reinforcement learning. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and develop a deep Q-network (DQN) based algorithm to learn the optimal allocation policy. Our approach leverages the concept of attention mechanisms to facilitate communication and coordination among agents. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency in complex scenarios.
