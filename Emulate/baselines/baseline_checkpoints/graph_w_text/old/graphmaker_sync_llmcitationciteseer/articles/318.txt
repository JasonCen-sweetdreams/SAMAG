Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficiently retrieving passages relevant to a given question. We propose a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach that learns to represent passages in a hierarchical manner, capturing both local and global semantic relationships. Our method uses a combination of dense passage embeddings and a hierarchical clustering algorithm to prune the search space, reducing the number of passages to be ranked by over 90%. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR outperforms state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods, achieving a 12% improvement in top-20 passage retrieval accuracy while reducing computational cost by 75%.
