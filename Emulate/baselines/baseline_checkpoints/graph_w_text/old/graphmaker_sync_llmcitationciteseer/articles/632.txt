Cloud computing environments are characterized by dynamic resource demands and unpredictable workloads. This paper proposes an adaptive agent-based resource allocation framework, 'AARA', which leverages autonomous agents to optimize resource utilization and minimize costs. AARA agents employ a decentralized, self-organizing architecture that adaptively adjusts resource allocation based on real-time workload patterns and available resources. Experimental results on a simulated cloud environment demonstrate that AARA outperforms traditional static allocation methods by up to 30% in terms of resource utilization and cost efficiency.
