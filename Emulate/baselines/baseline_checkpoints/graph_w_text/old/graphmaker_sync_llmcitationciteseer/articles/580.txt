In multi-agent systems, effective negotiation strategies are crucial for achieving mutually beneficial agreements. This paper presents a novel framework for autonomous negotiation in dynamic environments, where agents must adapt to changing circumstances and preferences. We introduce a machine learning-based approach that integrates temporal difference learning with opponent modeling, enabling agents to learn from experience and reason about their counterparts' intentions. Experimental results in a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate the proposed approach's ability to improve negotiation outcomes and facilitate more efficient agreements.
