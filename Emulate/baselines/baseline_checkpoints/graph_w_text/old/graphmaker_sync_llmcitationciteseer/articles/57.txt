In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that involves assigning tasks to agents in a way that maximizes overall system performance. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that combines auctions with reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'AuctionRL', allows agents to bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences, and uses reinforcement learning to adapt the bidding strategy over time. Experimental results show that AuctionRL outperforms traditional auction-based approaches in terms of system efficiency and fairness, and is robust to changes in the system dynamics.
