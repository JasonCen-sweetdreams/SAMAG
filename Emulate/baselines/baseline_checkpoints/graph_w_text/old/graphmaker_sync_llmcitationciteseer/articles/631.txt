This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, enabling explainable decision-making in complex environments. Our approach, HierAttn-MARL, integrates attention mechanisms at both the agent and team levels, allowing agents to selectively focus on relevant teammates and environment features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HierAttn-MARL in a variety of cooperative scenarios, showcasing improved collaboration and interpretability compared to existing MARL methods.
