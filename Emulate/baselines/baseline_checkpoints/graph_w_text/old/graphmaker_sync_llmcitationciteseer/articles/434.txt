Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a widely used technique to improve retrieval performance, but it often suffers from the issue of over-expansion or under-expansion. This paper proposes a novel approach, DeepRL-QE, which utilizes deep reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query expansion strategy. Our method learns to select the most informative terms to add to the original query, by maximizing a reward function that balances recall and precision. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DeepRL-QE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision.
