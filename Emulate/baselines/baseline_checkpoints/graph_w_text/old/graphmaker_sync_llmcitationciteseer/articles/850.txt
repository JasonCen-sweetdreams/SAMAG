We present a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging distributed auctions to efficiently assign tasks to agents. Our approach, called DA-MAS, enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and availability, while ensuring fairness and minimizing communication overhead. We prove the convergence of DA-MAS to a Nash equilibrium and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulation experiments, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced latency compared to centralized allocation methods.
