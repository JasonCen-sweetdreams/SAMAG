Distributed databases pose significant challenges in optimizing query execution plans, as the complexity of the problem scales exponentially with the number of nodes. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed databases. Our method, called 'RL-QOP', utilizes a graph neural network to learn a policy for selecting optimal query plans based on the database schema, workload, and system configuration. We evaluate RL-QOP on a real-world dataset and demonstrate improved query performance and reduced latency compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
