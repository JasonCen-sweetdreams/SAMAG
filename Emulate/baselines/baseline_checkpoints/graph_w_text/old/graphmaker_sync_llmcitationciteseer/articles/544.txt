Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a crucial component in many AI applications, but querying entities and relationships in KGs remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a hybrid retrieval model, HERMES, which combines the strengths of both semantic matching and graph-based ranking. HERMES leverages entity embeddings and graph convolutional networks to capture both semantic and structural information in KGs. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HERMES outperforms state-of-the-art models in entity disambiguation and relationship prediction tasks, achieving significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
