Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face significant scalability challenges as the volume of data and user queries continue to grow. This paper presents a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HierDir', which partitions the index into multiple tiers based on query frequency and document similarity. We develop an efficient index construction algorithm that leverages sketches and probabilistic data structures to reduce storage overhead and query latency. Experimental results on a large-scale DIR benchmark demonstrate that HierDir outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 30% in terms of query throughput and 25% in terms of average response time.
