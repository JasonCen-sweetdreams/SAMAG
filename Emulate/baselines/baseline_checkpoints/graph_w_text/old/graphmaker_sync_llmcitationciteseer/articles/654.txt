Graph pattern mining is a fundamental operation in graph databases, but its scalability is limited by disk-based indexing approaches. This paper presents 'Graphix', a distributed in-memory indexing framework that leverages GPU acceleration and hierarchical memory management to enable fast graph pattern mining at scale. We propose a novel indexing scheme that combines Bloom filters with compact bit-vector representations, achieving a 5x speedup over state-of-the-art disk-based approaches. Experimental results on large-scale graph datasets demonstrate Graphix's ability to handle complex patterns and large graphs, making it suitable for real-world applications in social network analysis and knowledge graph querying.
