Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but current haptic feedback systems often fail to provide a natural and immersive experience. This paper presents a novel adaptive haptic feedback framework that leverages machine learning to personalize and optimize tactile feedback based on individual user preferences and behavior. Our approach incorporates real-time physiological signals, such as heart rate and skin conductance, to infer user emotions and adjust the haptic feedback accordingly. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates significant improvements in user experience, presence, and overall satisfaction with our adaptive haptic feedback system.
