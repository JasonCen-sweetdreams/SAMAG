Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks, but their robustness against adversarial attacks remains a concern. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the adversarial robustness of GNNs by refining the graph structure through a hierarchical process. Our method, Hierarchical Graph Refinement (HGR), iteratively identifies and refines the most vulnerable nodes in the graph, leading to improved robustness against targeted attacks. We evaluate HGR on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in robustness compared to existing defense methods, while maintaining competitive performance on clean data.
