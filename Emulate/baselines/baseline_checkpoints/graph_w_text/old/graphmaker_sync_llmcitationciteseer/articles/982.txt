In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using hierarchical graph reinforcement learning (HGRL) to allocate tasks among agents. Our method leverages a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to optimize task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated drone surveillance scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of task completion rate and communication overhead.
