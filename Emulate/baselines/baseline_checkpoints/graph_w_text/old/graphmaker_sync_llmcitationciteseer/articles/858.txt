Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current VR systems often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with varying levels of visual impairment. We conducted a user study to identify key design principles and developed a set of guidelines for creating accessible VR interfaces. Our approach incorporates multimodal feedback, audio-based navigation, and personalized accessibility settings. Evaluation results show significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction among participants with visual impairments.
