Distributed database systems are increasingly used in modern applications, but query optimization remains a complex and time-consuming task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called 'DQOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan from a large state space. We evaluate DQOpt on a real-world distributed database system and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
