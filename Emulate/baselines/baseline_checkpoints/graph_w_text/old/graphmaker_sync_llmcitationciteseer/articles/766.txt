Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing complex relationships between entities. However, query optimization in distributed graph databases remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'Distributed Graph Optimizer' (DGO), which leverages both structural and statistical properties of the graph to optimize query plans. DGO uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm to partition the graph into smaller subgraphs, reducing communication overhead and improving query response times. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world social network dataset shows that DGO outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x.
