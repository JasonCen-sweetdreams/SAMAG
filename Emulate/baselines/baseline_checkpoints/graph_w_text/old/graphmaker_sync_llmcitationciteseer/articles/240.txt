In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and decentralized solutions. This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism, called 'AgentAuction', that enables autonomous agents to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. AgentAuction leverages a combinatorial auction framework to allow agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We prove that AgentAuction is strategically robust and achieves near-optimal social welfare. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentAuction in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
