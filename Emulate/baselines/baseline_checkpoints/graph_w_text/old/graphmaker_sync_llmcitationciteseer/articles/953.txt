Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that incorporates both user and item relationships to generate personalized explanations. Our approach utilizes a multi-level attention mechanism to identify relevant features and items, thereby improving recommendation accuracy and transparency. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of HGAT in terms of explanation quality and recommendation performance.
