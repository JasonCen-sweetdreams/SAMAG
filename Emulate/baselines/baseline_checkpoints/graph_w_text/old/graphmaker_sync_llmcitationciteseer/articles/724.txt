Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained increasing attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that incorporates both item and user relationships to generate personalized explanations for recommendations. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to learn multi-level representations of items and users, which enables the model to capture complex relationships and provide more accurate and interpretable recommendations. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation performance and providing meaningful explanations.
