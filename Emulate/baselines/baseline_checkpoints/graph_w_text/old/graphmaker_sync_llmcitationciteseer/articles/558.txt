Gamification has shown promise in enhancing user engagement in learning systems, but one-size-fits-all approaches often lead to boredom or frustration. This paper presents 'GazeAdapt', a novel HCI framework that leverages eye-tracking data to adapt the difficulty level of gamified learning tasks in real-time. By analyzing gaze patterns, our system infers user cognitive load and adjusts task complexity to maintain an optimal level of engagement. We evaluate GazeAdapt in a user study involving 40 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in learning outcomes, user satisfaction, and overall system usability.
