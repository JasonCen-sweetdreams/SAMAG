Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management. However, optimizing query execution plans in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal plan from a large space of possible plans. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
