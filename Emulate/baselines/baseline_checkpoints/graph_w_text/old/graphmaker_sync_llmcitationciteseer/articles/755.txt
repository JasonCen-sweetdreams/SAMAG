Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large volumes of data. However, efficient data retrieval remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, TrieDex, which leverages trie-based data structures to expedite query processing in distributed databases. TrieDex employs a hierarchical indexing approach that reduces the number of disk accesses and minimizes network communication overhead. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that TrieDex outperforms traditional indexing methods by up to 30% in terms of query response time and 25% in terms of storage efficiency.
