In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and decentralized solutions. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to autonomous agents in a decentralized manner. We model the agent communication network as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn a task allocation policy that takes into account agent capabilities, task priorities, and communication constraints. Our approach is evaluated on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
