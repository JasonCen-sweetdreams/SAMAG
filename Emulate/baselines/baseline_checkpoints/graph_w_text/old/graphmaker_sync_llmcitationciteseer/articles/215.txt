In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn agent-agent and agent-task relationships. Our approach, 'GNN-Allocator', enables agents to communicate and negotiate task assignments in a distributed manner, without relying on a centralized controller. We evaluate GNN-Allocator in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional auction-based methods.
