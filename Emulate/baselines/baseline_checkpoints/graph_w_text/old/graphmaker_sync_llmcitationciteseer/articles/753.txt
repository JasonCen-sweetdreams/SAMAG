Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) leveraging AI have shown promise in improving healthcare outcomes, but often suffer from a lack of transparency and interpretability. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for CDSSs that generates attention weights to highlight relevant clinical features and their interactions. Our approach enables explainable AI-driven decision-making by identifying critical patient data and relationships that influence the prediction. Experimental results on a large electronic health record dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in improving CDSS accuracy and facilitating domain expert trust.
