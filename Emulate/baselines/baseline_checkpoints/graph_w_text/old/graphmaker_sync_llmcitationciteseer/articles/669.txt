Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a multimodal interaction approach to create more inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults to identify pain points in current voice assistant designs and developed a prototype that incorporates visual and tactile cues to enhance user understanding and engagement. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach improves task completion rates and user satisfaction for older adults, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in HCI.
