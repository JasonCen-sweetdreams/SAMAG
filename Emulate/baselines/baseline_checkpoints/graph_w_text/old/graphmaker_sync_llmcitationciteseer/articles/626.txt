Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their scalability and fault-tolerance. However, optimizing query execution plans in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to predict the optimal join order and indexing strategy for a given query. Our approach is evaluated on a real-world dataset and shows significant improvements in query execution time compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques. We also demonstrate the adaptability of our approach to changing workload patterns and database schema.
