Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies heavily on efficient passage retrieval to answer user queries. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) framework that leverages the strengths of both sparse and dense retrieval methods. Our approach uses a two-stage process, where a sparse retriever identifies top-k relevant passages, and a dense retriever refines the ranking using a hierarchical attention mechanism. We evaluate HDR on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and answer recall, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
