This paper presents an innovative gaze-based interaction system for users with disabilities, enabling them to effectively communicate with intelligent virtual assistants. Our approach leverages a deep neural network to accurately detect and classify gaze patterns, facilitating seamless interaction with virtual agents. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in interaction time and user satisfaction compared to traditional input methods. The proposed system has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction for individuals with disabilities, enhancing their overall quality of life.
