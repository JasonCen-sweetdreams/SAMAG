This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize task assignment and execution. Our approach, dubbed 'HTA-MA', utilizes a hierarchical architecture to decompose complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks, which are then allocated to agents based on their capabilities and availability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HTA-MA in simulations, showing significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
