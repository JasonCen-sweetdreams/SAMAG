Designing accessible interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments is a pressing concern in HCI. This paper presents a participatory co-design approach that engages older adults in the design process, focusing on their needs and preferences. We conducted a series of workshops with 15 older adults, exploring their experiences with technology and identifying design principles that cater to their cognitive abilities. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and personalized feedback in interface design. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study, showcasing a redesigned healthcare portal that improves usability and accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments.
