Modern search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from an exponentially growing corpus. This paper proposes a novel query expansion technique, Hierarchical Query Expansion (HQE), which leverages the hierarchical structure of thesauri to selectively expand queries. HQE identifies the most informative terms in the query and expands them using a hierarchical traversal of the thesaurus, thereby reducing the dimensionality of the query space. Our experimental evaluation on the TREC-8 dataset shows that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, achieving a 25% improvement in mean average precision.
