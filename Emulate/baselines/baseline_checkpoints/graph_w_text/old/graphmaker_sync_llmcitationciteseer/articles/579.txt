Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and network communication. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach using genetic algorithms, which adaptively searches for optimal query plans based on the characteristics of the distributed database. We introduce a fitness function that incorporates both query execution time and network latency, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques in terms of query response time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database setup show significant performance improvements for complex queries.
