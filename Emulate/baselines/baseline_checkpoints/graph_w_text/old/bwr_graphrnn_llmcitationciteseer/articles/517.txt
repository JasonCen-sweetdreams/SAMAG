Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph traversals and the inherent distributed nature of the data. This paper proposes an adaptive caching framework, 'GraphCache', which leverages graph structural properties and query patterns to dynamically cache and prefetch relevant graph partitions. Our experiments on a real-world social network dataset show that GraphCache achieves an average query speedup of 3.2x compared to state-of-the-art caching techniques, while reducing the overall cache miss rate by 25%.
