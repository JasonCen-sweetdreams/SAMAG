Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their benefits are often inaccessible to older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a human-centered design approach for creating inclusive voice assistants that cater to the unique needs of this population. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements, such as simplified language processing, personalized feedback mechanisms, and multimodal output options. Our prototype, 'ElderVoice', demonstrates the feasibility of these design principles and shows significant improvements in user engagement and task completion rates compared to commercial voice assistants.
