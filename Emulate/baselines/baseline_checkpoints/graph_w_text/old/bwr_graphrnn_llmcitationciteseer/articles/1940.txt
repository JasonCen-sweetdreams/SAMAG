The increasing scale and complexity of modern distributed database systems necessitate efficient query optimization techniques. This paper explores the application of learned index structures to improve query performance in distributed databases. We propose a novel learned index framework, 'Distributed Adaptive Indexing' (DAI), which leverages machine learning models to predict query patterns and optimize index creation. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DAI outperforms traditional indexing methods by up to 30% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
