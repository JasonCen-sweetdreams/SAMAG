As graph databases continue to grow in scale and complexity, query optimization becomes a critical bottleneck. This paper presents a novel distributed query optimization framework, 'DistroOpt', which leverages graph partitioning and parallel processing to improve query performance. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that takes into account the graph structure, query patterns, and available resources to generate efficient query plans. Experimental results on a large-scale graph dataset demonstrate that DistroOpt achieves up to 5x speedup compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers while maintaining scalability and flexibility.
