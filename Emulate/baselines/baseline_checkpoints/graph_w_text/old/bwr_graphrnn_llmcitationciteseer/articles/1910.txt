Distributed graph databases are increasingly used in various applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph structural properties and distributed query processing techniques. We introduce a cost-based optimization approach that considers both data locality and communication overhead, and develop a set of efficient join ordering and subquery optimization algorithms. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt achieves up to 3x speedup compared to existing query optimization techniques.
