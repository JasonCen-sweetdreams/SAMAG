The proliferation of heterogeneous document collections has led to a surge in information retrieval (IR) challenges. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) framework to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of document retrieval. HQE integrates topic modeling, word embeddings, and hierarchical clustering to generate context-aware query expansions that adapt to the collection's structural properties. Experiments on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and query processing time, particularly for complex queries and sparse collections.
