Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods often rely on linear or shallow models, limiting their ability to capture complex relationships between users and items. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention (HGA) framework, which leverages the strengths of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to learn hierarchical representations of user-item interactions. HGA provides transparent and interpretable recommendations, outperforming state-of-the-art ERS methods on multiple benchmark datasets. Our framework also enables the identification of influential users and items, facilitating the development of more effective personalized recommendation systems.
