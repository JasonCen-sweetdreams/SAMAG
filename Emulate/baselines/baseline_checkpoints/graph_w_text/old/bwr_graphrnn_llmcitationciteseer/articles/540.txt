Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving feedback in the form of execution times. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model query plans and incorporates domain knowledge to guide the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time, while reducing optimization overhead by 25%.
