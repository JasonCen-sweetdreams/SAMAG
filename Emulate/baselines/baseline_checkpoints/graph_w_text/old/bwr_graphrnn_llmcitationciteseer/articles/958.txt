Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their potential benefits are often inaccessible to older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments and 10 caregivers, which informed the development of our prototype, 'EasyVocal'. EasyVocal incorporates natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine learning algorithms to accommodate users' communication styles and abilities. Our evaluation shows that EasyVocal significantly improves task completion rates, user satisfaction, and caregiver burden reduction compared to existing voice assistants.
