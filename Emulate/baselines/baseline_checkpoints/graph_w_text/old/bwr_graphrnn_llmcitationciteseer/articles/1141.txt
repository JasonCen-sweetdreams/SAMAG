Multi-tenancy in cloud databases has become increasingly popular, but it poses significant challenges to query optimization. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization that leverages tenant-specific workload patterns and resource utilization. We propose a hybrid optimization framework that combines deterministic and probabilistic optimization techniques to minimize query latency and improve resource allocation. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world cloud database system demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing optimization methods, making our approach suitable for large-scale multi-tenant database deployments.
