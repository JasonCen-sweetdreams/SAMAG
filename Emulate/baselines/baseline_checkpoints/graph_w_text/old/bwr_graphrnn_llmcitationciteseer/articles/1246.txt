Voice assistants have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, current systems often fail to accommodate their unique needs, leading to frustration and abandonment. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, 'CARE', that adapts to the cognitive and language abilities of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with caregivers and older adults to inform the design of CARE's conversational interface, error handling mechanisms, and personalized feedback system. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
