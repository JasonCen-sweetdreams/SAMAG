As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding human-agent interaction is crucial. This study investigates the role of embodiment in shaping trust between humans and agents in VR. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with embodied and non-embodied agents in a collaborative task. Results show that embodied agents lead to higher trust and cooperation, particularly when agents exhibit human-like gestures and body language. Our findings have implications for designing more effective and trustworthy human-agent interfaces in VR applications.
