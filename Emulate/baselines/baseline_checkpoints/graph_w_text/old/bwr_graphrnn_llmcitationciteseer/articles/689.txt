Distributed graph databases are increasingly used in various applications, but query optimization remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph data and distributed architecture. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphRL', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed graph databases. GraphRL learns to predict the optimal join order and indexing strategy based on the graph structure, query patterns, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
