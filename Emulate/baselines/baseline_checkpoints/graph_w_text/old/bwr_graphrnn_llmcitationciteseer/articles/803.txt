In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects overall system performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive task allocation using reinforcement learning. We introduce a decentralized framework, 'ATAgent', which enables agents to learn from experience and adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Our approach utilizes a combination of Q-learning and graph neural networks to optimize task assignments and improve system efficiency. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods and achieves near-optimal task allocation in dynamic environments.
