Multi-agent planning has numerous applications in domains like robotics, logistics, and smart cities. However, scalability remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with complex task networks. This paper presents a novel framework, 'Hydra', which leverages hierarchical task networks (HTNs) to efficiently plan for large teams of agents. Hydra incorporates a probabilistic decomposition of the HTN into smaller sub-problems, allowing for parallel planning and reducing the computational overhead. Experimental results on a realistic urban planning scenario demonstrate that Hydra outperforms state-of-the-art planners in terms of solution quality and computation time.
