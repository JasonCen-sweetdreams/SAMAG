Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database system. Our experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average reduction of 30% in query execution time. We also demonstrate the scalability of our approach on a real-world distributed database system.
