Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of graph data and the distributed nature of the system. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the graph structure, query patterns, and system workload. Our experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach achieves an average of 30% reduction in query latency and 25% improvement in system throughput compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
