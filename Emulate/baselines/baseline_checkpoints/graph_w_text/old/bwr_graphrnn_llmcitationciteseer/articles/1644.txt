Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a major challenge. This paper presents 'GraphOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages graph structural properties and statistical correlations to reduce query latency. We propose a distributed, parallelizable algorithm for identifying optimal query plans, which is adaptive to the underlying graph topology and data distribution. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
