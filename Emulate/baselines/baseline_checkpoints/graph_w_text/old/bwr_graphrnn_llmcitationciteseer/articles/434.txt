Recommender systems face significant challenges in handling large-scale user-item interaction data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global graph structures to model complex relationships between users and items. Our HGAT model consists of a hierarchical graph encoder and a graph attention-based decoder, which jointly learn to represent users and items as dense vectors. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of recommendation accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing graph-based methods.
