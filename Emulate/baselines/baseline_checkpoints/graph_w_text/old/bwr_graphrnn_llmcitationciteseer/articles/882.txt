Individuals with motor impairments often face significant barriers when interacting with gestural interfaces. This paper presents a novel design framework, ' GestureEase', which incorporates machine learning-based gesture recognition and adaptation techniques to accommodate diverse motor abilities. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, including those with Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injury, and demonstrated significant improvements in interface accessibility and user experience. GestureEase is integrated with a wearable sensor system, enabling real-time gesture classification and personalized feedback.
