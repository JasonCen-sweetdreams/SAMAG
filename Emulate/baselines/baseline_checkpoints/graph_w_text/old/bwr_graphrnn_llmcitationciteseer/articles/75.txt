Multi-agent systems often require efficient task allocation to achieve collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized approach using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to allocate tasks in a dynamic and uncertain environment. We propose a novel DCOP algorithm, 'AgentDCOP', that leverages local communication and negotiation among agents to find near-optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that AgentDCOP outperforms centralized optimization methods in terms of solution quality and adaptability to changing task requirements.
