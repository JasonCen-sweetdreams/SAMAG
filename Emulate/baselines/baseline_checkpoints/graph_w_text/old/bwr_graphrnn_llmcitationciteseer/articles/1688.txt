This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel architecture, 'MADRL-Allocator', which utilizes a combination of graph neural networks and deep Q-networks to learn effective task assignment policies. Our approach is capable of handling large-scale systems with varying agent capabilities and task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that MADRL-Allocator outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
