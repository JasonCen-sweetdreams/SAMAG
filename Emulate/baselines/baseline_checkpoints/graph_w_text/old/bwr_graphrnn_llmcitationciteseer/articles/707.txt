Multi-agent systems often require efficient task allocation to accomplish complex goals. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach, called 'GNN-TA', uses a hierarchical GNN architecture to learn a distributed task allocation policy that adapts to changing environmental conditions. We evaluate GNN-TA on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional distributed allocation methods.
