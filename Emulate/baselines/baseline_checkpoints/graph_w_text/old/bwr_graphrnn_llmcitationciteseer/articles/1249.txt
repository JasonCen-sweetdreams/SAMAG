Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and dynamic reordering of query operators to minimize execution time. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world social network dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing query optimization techniques.
