In this paper, we investigate the problem of distributed task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents possess different capabilities and resources. We propose a novel reinforcement learning-based approach, called HRL-TA, that enables agents to learn effective task allocation strategies through interactions with their environment. HRL-TA leverages a hierarchical coordination mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation, leading to improved system performance and adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HRL-TA in simulated scenarios, outperforming traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
