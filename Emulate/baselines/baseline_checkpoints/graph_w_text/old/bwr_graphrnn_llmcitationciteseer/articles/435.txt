Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus and answering a question based on the retrieved passages. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HNRM', which efficiently retrieves top-ranked passages for ODQA. HNRM uses a combination of dense and sparse representations to model the passage-question similarity, and a cascaded ranking mechanism to prune irrelevant passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HNRM achieves state-of-the-art passage retrieval performance while reducing the computational cost by 30% compared to existing models.
