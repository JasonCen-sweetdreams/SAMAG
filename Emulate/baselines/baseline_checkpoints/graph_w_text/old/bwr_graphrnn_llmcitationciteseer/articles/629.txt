In multi-agent systems, cooperative task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents while satisfying constraints and optimizing performance metrics. This paper proposes a novel distributed constraint optimization approach that leverages the strengths of both constraint programming and distributed optimization. Our approach, called DCOTA, decomposes the global constraint problem into local sub-problems, which are solved using a distributed constraint optimization algorithm. We evaluate DCOTA on a real-world disaster response scenario and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving efficient and resilient task allocation compared to centralized and decentralized baseline methods.
