Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in node classification tasks. However, existing methods often overlook the inherent hierarchical structure present in many real-world graphs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchy-aware graph attention network (HAGAT) that incorporates hierarchical information into the graph attention mechanism. HAGAT leverages a recursive graph pooling strategy to capture node representations at different scales, allowing the model to focus on relevant hierarchical patterns. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGAT outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification tasks, particularly on graphs with strong hierarchical structures.
