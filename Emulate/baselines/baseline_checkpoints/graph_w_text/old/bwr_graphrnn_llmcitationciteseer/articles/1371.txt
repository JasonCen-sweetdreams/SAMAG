Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of individuals with motor impairments, but existing VR interfaces often pose significant accessibility barriers. This paper presents a novel framework for designing VR interfaces that are accessible to users with motor impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to identify key usability challenges and developed a set of design guidelines for accessible VR interaction techniques. Our evaluation shows that the proposed guidelines can significantly improve user performance and satisfaction in VR applications. The findings of this study have implications for the development of inclusive VR experiences that can benefit individuals with motor impairments.
