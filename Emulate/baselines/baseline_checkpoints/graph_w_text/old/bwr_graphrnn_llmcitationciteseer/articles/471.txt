As dataset sizes continue to grow, query optimization techniques play a crucial role in achieving efficient data retrieval. This paper explores the application of learned index structures to multi-dimensional data querying. We propose a novel neural network-based approach, 'LISQL', which learns to predict query predicates and adaptively reorders index creation to minimize query latency. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LISQL outperforms traditional query optimization methods by up to 3x, while maintaining accuracy and robustness to data distribution shifts.
