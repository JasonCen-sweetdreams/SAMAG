The rapid adoption of voice assistants has transformed the way people interact with technology. However, older adults often face significant barriers when using these systems, including difficulties with speech recognition, navigation, and goal-oriented task completion. This paper presents a participatory co-design approach to developing more inclusive voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a series of workshops with 20 older adults, identifying key challenges and opportunities for design innovation. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant framework that incorporates adaptable interfaces, personalized feedback, and multimodal input support. A usability evaluation with 15 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
