As autonomous agents increasingly interact with humans, explainability of their decision-making processes becomes crucial. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for multi-agent systems, which learns to selectively focus on relevant agents, states, and actions when making decisions. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify influential factors. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate improved decision-making performance and enhanced explainability compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods.
