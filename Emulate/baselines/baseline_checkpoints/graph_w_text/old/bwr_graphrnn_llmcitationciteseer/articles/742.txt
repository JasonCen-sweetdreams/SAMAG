In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a fundamental problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in real-time. Our approach utilizes a novel neural network architecture that incorporates graph attention and multi-agent Q-learning to learn effective task allocation strategies. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse robotics scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
