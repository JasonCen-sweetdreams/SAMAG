Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents an empirical study on the challenges and opportunities of designing inclusive voice assistants for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and clinicians to identify key barriers and propose design recommendations. Our findings highlight the importance of simplifying language processing, providing multimodal feedback, and incorporating emotional support features. We also introduce a novel evaluation framework for assessing the accessibility and usability of voice assistants for older adults with cognitive impairments.
