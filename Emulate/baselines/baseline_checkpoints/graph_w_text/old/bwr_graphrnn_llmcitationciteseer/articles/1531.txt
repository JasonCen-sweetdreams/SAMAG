In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'DMA', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal policies for task assignment and execution. DMA utilizes a novel, actor-critic architecture that incorporates graph neural networks to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate that DMA outperforms traditional, centralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and overall system efficiency.
