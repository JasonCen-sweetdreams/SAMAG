This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive resource allocation in IoT environments using self-organizing agent networks. Our framework, 'SOAR', leverages decentralized decision-making and negotiation protocols to enable agents to dynamically allocate resources in response to changing environmental conditions. We introduce a novel metric, 'Resource Utilization Efficiency' (RUE), to evaluate the performance of SOAR in simulated smart city scenarios. Results show that SOAR outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of RUE, while also providing improved fault tolerance and scalability.
