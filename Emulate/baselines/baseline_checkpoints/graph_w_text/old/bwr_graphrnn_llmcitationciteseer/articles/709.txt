Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We develop an RL framework that learns to optimize query plans based on system workload, data distribution, and resource utilization. Our approach, called 'QOptiRL', uses a deep Q-network to select the optimal query plan from a set of candidate plans. Experimental results on a distributed database system show that QOptiRL achieves an average query response time reduction of 35% compared to traditional query optimization techniques, while adapting to changing system conditions.
