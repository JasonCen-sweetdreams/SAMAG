Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex network data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge, especially for large-scale graphs. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy. Our approach, called GraphOpt, leverages a combination of graph structural features and query execution statistics to adaptively select the most efficient query plan. Experimental results on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
