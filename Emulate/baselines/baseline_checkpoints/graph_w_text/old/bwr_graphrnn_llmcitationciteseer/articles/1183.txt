Few-shot learning has gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing approaches are limited by their scalability to larger datasets and their reliance on complex meta-learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Prototypical Networks (HPN), a novel few-shot learning framework that leverages hierarchical clustering to adapt prototypical representations to new tasks. HPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while reducing computational overhead by an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HPN in various applications, including image classification, object detection, and natural language processing.
