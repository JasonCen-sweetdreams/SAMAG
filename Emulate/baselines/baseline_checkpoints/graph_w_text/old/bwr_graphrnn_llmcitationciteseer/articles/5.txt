Distributed databases employing multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) face significant performance challenges due to the complexity of query optimization. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MVCC-OPT', which leverages graph-based analysis to identify optimal execution plans for transactions. MVCC-OPT incorporates a probabilistic modeling approach to capture the dynamics of concurrent transactions and adapts to changing workload patterns. Experimental results using the TPC-C benchmark demonstrate that MVCC-OPT achieves up to 30% improvement in transaction throughput and 25% reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
