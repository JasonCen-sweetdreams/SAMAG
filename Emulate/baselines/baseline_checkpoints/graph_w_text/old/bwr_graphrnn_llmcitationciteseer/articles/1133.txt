Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing query performance for diverse workloads remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for multi-tenant databases. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', learns to adapt to changing workload patterns and resource availability, achieving significant improvements in query latency and throughput compared to traditional optimization techniques. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world multi-tenant database system and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing query execution times by up to 40%.
