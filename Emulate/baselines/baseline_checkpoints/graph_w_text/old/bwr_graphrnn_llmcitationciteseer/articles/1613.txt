As data volumes and velocities increase, traditional data warehousing solutions struggle to deliver timely query responses. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'RTQO', tailored for real-time data warehousing. RTQO leverages a combination of materialized views, incremental view maintenance, and adaptive indexing to minimize query latency. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that dynamically selects the most efficient query plan based on workload characteristics and system resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world financial dataset demonstrate that RTQO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
