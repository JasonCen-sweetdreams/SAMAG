Deep learning-based recommender systems have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various applications, but their lack of transparency and interpretability hinders their adoption in high-stakes domains. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both item-level and user-level attention mechanisms to provide insights into the recommendation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in generating personalized recommendations while providing visualizable explanations for the suggested items. Our experiments on a large-scale e-commerce dataset show that HAN outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explainability.
