Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, especially in decentralized settings where agents have limited communication and computation resources. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task allocation policies in a decentralized manner. We model the agent interactions as a graph and train a GNN to predict task assignments that maximize system efficiency. Our approach outperforms traditional decentralized task allocation methods in simulation experiments, demonstrating its potential for real-world applications in autonomous systems, robotics, and smart cities.
