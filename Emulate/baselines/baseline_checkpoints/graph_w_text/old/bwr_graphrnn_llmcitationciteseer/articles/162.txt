Emotional feedback is crucial for creating empathetic human-computer interactions. This paper explores the use of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to elicit emotional responses from users. We design and evaluate an ECA-based system that employs multimodal cues, such as gestures and facial expressions, to simulate emotional conversations. Our user study reveals that users are more likely to express their emotions when interacting with an ECA that mirrors their emotional state. We also identify key design factors that influence users' emotional disclosure, including the ECA's emotional intensity and the conversational context.
