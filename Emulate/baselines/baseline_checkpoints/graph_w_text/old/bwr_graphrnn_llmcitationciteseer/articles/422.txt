This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision-making. Our approach enables agents to selectively focus on relevant state features and communicate with each other to achieve shared goals. We introduce a new explainability metric, 'attention entropy', to quantify the interpretability of agent decisions. Experimental results in a cooperative navigation domain demonstrate that our HAN-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task performance and explainability, while reducing the need for explicit communication protocols.
