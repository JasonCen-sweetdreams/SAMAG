Real-time data warehousing requires efficient concurrency control mechanisms to ensure timely and consistent data analysis. Existing solutions often compromise on performance, scalability, or data freshness. This paper presents 'RT-MVCC', a novel multi-version concurrency control protocol designed for real-time data warehousing. RT-MVCC leverages a combination of timestamp-based and snapshot-based concurrency control, enabling efficient handling of concurrent queries and updates. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that RT-MVCC outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of query latency, throughput, and data freshness, making it a promising solution for real-time analytics workloads.
