Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn efficient query optimization strategies. We model the database schema as a graph and use GNNs to learn a representation of the query optimization problem. Our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and reduces the number of unnecessary joins. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving query performance.
