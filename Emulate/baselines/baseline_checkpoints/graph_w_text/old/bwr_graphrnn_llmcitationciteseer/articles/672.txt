Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it helps to refine the search query and improve the retrieval accuracy. However, traditional query expansion methods rely on heuristic approaches, which may not always capture the nuances of the query intent. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based query expansion framework, which learns to optimize the expansion process by interacting with the retrieval environment. Our approach, dubbed 'RL-QE', uses a deep Q-network to select the most informative expansion terms, taking into account the relevance feedback from the user. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
