In decentralized multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to heterogeneous agents. We propose a decentralized GNN architecture that integrates agent-level features, task requirements, and communication constraints to optimize task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time, Makespan, and adaptability to dynamic changes in the environment.
