Decision-making in multi-agent systems often relies on black-box models, lacking transparency and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that generates explainable decisions in cooperative and competitive multi-agent environments. Our HAN model learns to selectively focus on relevant agents, attributes, and interactions, producing attention weights that reveal the decision-making process. We evaluate the proposed approach on two multi-agent domains, demonstrating improved decision quality and explainability compared to existing methods.
