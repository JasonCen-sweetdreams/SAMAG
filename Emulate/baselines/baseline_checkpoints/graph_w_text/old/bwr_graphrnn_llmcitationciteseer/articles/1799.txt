In Virtual Reality (VR) environments, understanding user intent is crucial for creating immersive and interactive experiences. This paper presents EyeGazeAnalytics, a machine learning framework that leverages eye movement patterns to infer user intent. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with graph-based models to analyze gaze data and identify patterns indicative of user interest, attention, and decision-making. We evaluate EyeGazeAnalytics on a large-scale VR dataset and demonstrate its ability to accurately predict user intent, outperforming existing methods by 15% in F1-score.
