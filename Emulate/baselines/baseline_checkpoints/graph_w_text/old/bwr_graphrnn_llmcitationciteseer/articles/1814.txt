Public displays are increasingly being used in urban spaces, but their accessibility features often fall short of meeting the diverse needs of users. This paper presents an adaptive user interface framework, 'AURA', that dynamically adjusts display settings based on user behavior, environment, and accessibility requirements. AURA incorporates machine learning-based models to detect user preferences, ambient lighting conditions, and accessibility needs. We evaluate AURA through a user study involving 30 participants with varying abilities and demonstrate significant improvements in usability, readability, and user satisfaction.
