Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the need to optimize for distributed execution. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'DGraphOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and adaptive query rewriting to minimize query latency and improve resource utilization. We evaluate DGraphOpt on a real-world social network dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing query optimization techniques.
