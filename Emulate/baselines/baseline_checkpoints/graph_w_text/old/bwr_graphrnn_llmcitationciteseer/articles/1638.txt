Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our approach incorporates multi-scale attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant temporal and spatial patterns, enabling the model to identify anomalies while providing insights into their underlying causes. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of explainability and accuracy.
