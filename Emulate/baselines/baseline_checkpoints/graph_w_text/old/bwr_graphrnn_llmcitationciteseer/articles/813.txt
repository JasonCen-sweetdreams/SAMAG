In multi-agent systems, negotiation is a crucial mechanism for agents to reach mutually beneficial agreements. However, in real-world scenarios, agents often possess incomplete information about each other's preferences and utility functions. This paper proposes a novel decentralized negotiation mechanism, dubbed 'DIME', which enables agents to effectively negotiate and reach agreements even with incomplete information. DIME leverages Bayesian learning and probabilistic graphical models to iteratively update agents' beliefs about each other's preferences. We demonstrate the efficacy of DIME in various scenarios, including resource allocation and task assignment, and show that it outperforms existing negotiation mechanisms in terms of social welfare and Pareto optimality.
