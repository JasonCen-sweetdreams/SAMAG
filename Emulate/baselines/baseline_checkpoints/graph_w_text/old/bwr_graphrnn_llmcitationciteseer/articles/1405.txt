Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-based machine learning, but it becomes increasingly challenging for large-scale graphs. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges at multiple scales. Our approach reduces the computational complexity of node classification by adaptively aggregating features from neighboring nodes and hierarchical representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
