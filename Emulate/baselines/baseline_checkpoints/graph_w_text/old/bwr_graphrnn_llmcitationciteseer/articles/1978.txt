As cloud-based database services continue to grow, optimizing query performance for multi-tenant systems becomes increasingly important. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to query optimization for multi-tenant databases. We propose a novel framework, 'RL-Optimizer', which learns to select optimal query execution plans based on runtime feedback from the database. Our approach adapts to changing workloads and query patterns, achieving significant improvements in query response times and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world cloud database demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-Optimizer in reducing latency and improving overall system efficiency.
