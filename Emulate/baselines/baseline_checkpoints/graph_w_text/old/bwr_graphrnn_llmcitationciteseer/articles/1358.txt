In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to allocate tasks to agents in real-time. Our approach, called DRL-TA, uses a centralized critic to evaluate the global reward function and decentralized actor networks to learn optimal task allocation policies for each agent. We evaluate DRL-TA on a variety of scenarios, including search and rescue, and surveillance, demonstrating improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional methods.
