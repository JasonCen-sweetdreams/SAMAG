As the global population ages, there is a growing need to design technologies that cater to the cognitive and physical abilities of elderly users. This paper investigates the role of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in reducing cognitive load for older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65-85, who interacted with an ECA-based interface and a traditional graphical user interface (GUI) to complete a set of tasks. Our results show that the ECA condition led to significantly lower cognitive load, improved task performance, and higher user satisfaction compared to the GUI condition. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of inclusive HCI systems.
