Virtual Reality (VR) has seen widespread adoption in various domains, but securing user authentication in VR environments remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effects of cognitive load on gesture-based authentication in VR, considering both authentication accuracy and user experience. We designed an experiment involving 30 participants, who performed gesture-based authentication tasks under varying levels of cognitive load. Results show that increased cognitive load significantly degrades authentication accuracy, while also negatively impacting user experience. Our findings have implications for the design of secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms in VR.
