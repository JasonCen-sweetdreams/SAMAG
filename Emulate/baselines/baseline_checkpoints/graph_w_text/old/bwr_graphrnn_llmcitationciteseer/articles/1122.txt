Graph databases have become increasingly popular in various domains, but their query performance is often bottlenecked by inefficient join operations. This paper presents a novel in-memory join optimization technique, called 'GraphJoin', specifically designed for modern graph databases. GraphJoin leverages the properties of graph data and exploits the available memory bandwidth to minimize data transfer and reduce join latency. Our experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphJoin outperforms state-of-the-art join algorithms by up to 3x, making it a promising solution for graph query optimization.
