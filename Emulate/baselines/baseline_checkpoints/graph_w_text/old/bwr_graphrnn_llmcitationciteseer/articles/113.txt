Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the performance of search engines. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and simple keyword matching. We propose a novel approach, ContextAwareNE, which leverages neural embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and document content. Our model incorporates contextual information from user search history and query logs to adaptively generate expansion terms. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ContextAwareNE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision and a 20% improvement in recall.
