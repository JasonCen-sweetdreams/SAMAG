Real-time analytics has become a crucial component of modern data-driven applications. However, achieving high query performance in main-memory databases remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) approach that leverages the unique characteristics of main-memory databases to optimize query performance. Our approach, called 'MVCC-RT', uses a combination of in-memory data structures and optimized timestamp management to minimize contention and reduce latency. Experimental results on a real-world benchmark show that MVCC-RT outperforms state-of-the-art MVCC algorithms by up to 3x, enabling faster and more efficient real-time analytics.
