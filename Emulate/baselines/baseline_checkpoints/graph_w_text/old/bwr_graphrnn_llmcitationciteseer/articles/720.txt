Gesture recognition systems have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with motor impairments. However, existing systems often fail to account for the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a participatory design approach to developing inclusive gesture recognition systems that accommodate the motor abilities of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults with motor impairments and caregivers to identify design requirements and develop a prototype system. Our results show that the system can accurately recognize gestures with a mean accuracy of 92.5% and improve user experience and satisfaction.
