Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective passage retrieval to identify relevant contexts for answer extraction. This paper presents a novel approach, 'QDE', that leverages query-driven document expansion to enhance passage retrieval. QDE expands the initial query using semantic role labeling and dependency parsing to create a set of sub-queries, which are then used to retrieve additional passages. We demonstrate that QDE significantly improves the recall of relevant passages, leading to a 12.3% absolute increase in answer accuracy on the HotPotQA benchmark. Our analysis shows that QDE is particularly effective for questions requiring multi-hop reasoning and underscoring the importance of contextual understanding in ODQA.
