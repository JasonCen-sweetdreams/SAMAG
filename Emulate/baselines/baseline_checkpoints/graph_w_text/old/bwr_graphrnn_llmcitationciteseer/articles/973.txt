Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a given question. While dense passage retrievers have shown promise, they often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a hierarchical dense representation (HDR) approach, which leverages a two-level hierarchical architecture to efficiently index and retrieve passages. We demonstrate that HDR achieves state-of-the-art results on several ODQA benchmarks while reducing computational costs by up to 75%. Furthermore, we show that HDR can be easily adapted to incorporate additional supervision signals, leading to further improvements in retrieval accuracy.
