Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it helps to capture the nuances of user queries and retrieve more relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel graph-based keyword embedding approach, 'GraphQE', which incorporates semantic relationships between keywords to enhance query expansion. We leverage graph convolutional networks to learn dense vector representations of keywords and their contexts, allowing for more accurate expansion of query terms. Our experiments on popular IR benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional keyword-based expansion methods.
