Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework for ERS, which models user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph structure. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between users, items, and their attributes. We introduce a novel explanation module that generates faithful and interpretable explanations for the recommended items. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS models in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
