Distributed database systems face significant challenges in optimizing query performance, particularly in dynamic and uncertain environments. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively adjust query execution plans. We design a deep Q-network that learns to prioritize query optimization strategies based on real-time system metrics and query characteristics. Experimental results on a distributed database testbed demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 30% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
