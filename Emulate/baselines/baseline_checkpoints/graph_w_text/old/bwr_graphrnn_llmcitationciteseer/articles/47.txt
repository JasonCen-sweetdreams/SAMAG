Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in road scene understanding tasks, but their opacity hinders trust and adoption in safety-critical applications. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that provides transparent and explainable scene understanding. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to highlight relevant regions and objects in the scene, while a hierarchical structure enables the model to capture complex context-dependent relationships. We evaluate our method on the Cityscapes and KITTI datasets, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability compared to existing CNN-based approaches.
