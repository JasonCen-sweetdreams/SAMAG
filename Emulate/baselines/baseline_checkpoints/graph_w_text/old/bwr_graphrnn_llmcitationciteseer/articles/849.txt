Distributed database systems (DDBS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in DDBS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query planning and execution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDBS environment and receiving rewards based on query performance. Our experimental results show that the RL-based approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
