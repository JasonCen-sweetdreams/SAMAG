The proliferation of online content has made efficient document retrieval a crucial task in modern search engines. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) framework that leverages both local and global context to improve retrieval accuracy. HQE incorporates a graph-based approach to model semantic relationships between query terms and documents, enabling more effective expansion of the original query. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision (MAP) while reducing computational overhead by 30%.
