Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for applications like predictive maintenance and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that learns to identify anomalies while providing interpretable explanations. Our approach consists of a two-level attention mechanism that first selects relevant time-series segments and then focuses on discriminative features within those segments. We evaluate our method on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved detection performance and reduced false positives compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model's attention weights enable the identification of key contributing factors to the anomaly, facilitating root cause analysis.
