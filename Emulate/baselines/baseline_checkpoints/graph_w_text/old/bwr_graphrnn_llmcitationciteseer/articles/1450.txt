Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to query optimization, leveraging the ability of RL agents to learn from experience and adapt to changing system conditions. We propose a novel RL-based query optimizer, 'RL-QO', which utilizes a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query execution plan. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that RL-QO outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average reduction of 30% in query execution time.
