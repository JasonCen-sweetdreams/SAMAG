Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train an RL agent to learn an optimal policy for selecting the best execution plan. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our RL-based approach outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
