Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but their reliance on manual query formulation can limit their effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to adaptively refine the query representation. Our method, called 'NeuroFeedback', uses a neural network to model the relevance distribution of the top-ranked documents and generates new query terms that maximize the likelihood of relevant documents. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroFeedback improves the retrieval performance of state-of-the-art neural models, especially in cases where the initial query is poorly formulated.
