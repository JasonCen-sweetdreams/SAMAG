Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience and engagement in VR. We conducted a user study with 100 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar group or a generic avatar group. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, measured through subjective feedback and objective metrics such as session duration and interaction frequency. We also found that personalized avatars led to increased feelings of presence and self-identification. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems and highlight the potential of personalized avatars in improving user engagement.
