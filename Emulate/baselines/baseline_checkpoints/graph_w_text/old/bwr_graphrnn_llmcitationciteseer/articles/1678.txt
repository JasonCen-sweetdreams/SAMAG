Distributed information retrieval systems often struggle with query efficiency due to the massive amounts of data and complex querying mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, called HiDRI, to improve query processing times in such systems. HiDRI utilizes a multi-level indexing scheme that partitions the data into smaller, manageable chunks, and then applies a combination of caching and clustering techniques to reduce the number of nodes that need to be queried. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale dataset demonstrates that HiDRI achieves significant improvements in query response times, with an average reduction of 35% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
