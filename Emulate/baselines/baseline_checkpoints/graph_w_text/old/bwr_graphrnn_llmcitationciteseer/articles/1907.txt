The proliferation of fake news on social media poses a significant threat to modern society. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) for fake news detection. Our model leverages the structural properties of social networks to capture the spreading patterns of news and incorporates attention mechanisms to selectively focus on suspicious users and news articles. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale dataset of news articles and user interactions, demonstrating improved detection accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.
