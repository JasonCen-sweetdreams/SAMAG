High-dimensional data indexing is a crucial task in various applications, including data warehousing, data mining, and machine learning. Existing indexing techniques often suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to poor query performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical grid-based indexing approach, 'HiGrid', which adaptively partitions the data space into a hierarchical structure of grids. HiGrid achieves efficient query processing by leveraging the spatial locality of data points and reducing the number of disk accesses. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HiGrid outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query response time and storage efficiency.
