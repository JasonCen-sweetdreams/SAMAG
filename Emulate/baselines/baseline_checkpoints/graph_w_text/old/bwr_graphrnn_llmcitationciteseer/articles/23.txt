Autonomous agents often need to form coalitions to accomplish complex tasks. This paper presents a decentralized coalition formation algorithm for agents with heterogeneous capabilities, such as robots, drones, or sensors. Our approach leverages a novel graph-based representation of agent capabilities and preferences, enabling efficient computation of stable coalitions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive simulations, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing centralized approaches.
