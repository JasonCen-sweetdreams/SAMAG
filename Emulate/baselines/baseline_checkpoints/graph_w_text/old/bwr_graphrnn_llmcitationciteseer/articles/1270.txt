Distributed information retrieval systems face the challenge of efficiently processing queries across multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the benefits of inverted indexing and hash-based indexing. Our method, 'HIQ', adaptively partitions the index into nodes based on query workload analysis, reducing the number of nodes involved in query processing. Experimental results on a large-scale text dataset show that HIQ achieves significant improvements in query response time and reduces network communication overhead compared to traditional indexing methods.
