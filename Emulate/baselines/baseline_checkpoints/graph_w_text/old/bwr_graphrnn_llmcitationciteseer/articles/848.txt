Time series forecasting remains a crucial task in various domains, yet existing methods often lack transparency and interpretability. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that leverages both local and global patterns to improve forecasting accuracy and provide explainable results. Our approach incorporates a multi-scale encoder to capture temporal dependencies and a hierarchical attention mechanism to highlight relevant input features and time steps. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in achieving state-of-the-art forecasting performance while providing insightful feature importance scores and temporal attention visualizations.
