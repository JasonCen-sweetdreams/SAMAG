Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem. Existing methods rely on static word embeddings that fail to capture the contextual nuances of queries. We propose a novel approach, 'ConEx', which leverages context-aware embeddings to generate more informative expansion terms. Our method incorporates a graph-based attention mechanism to model the relationships between query terms and their surroundings. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConEx significantly outperforms state-of-the-art expansion techniques, leading to improved retrieval performance and enhanced user satisfaction.
