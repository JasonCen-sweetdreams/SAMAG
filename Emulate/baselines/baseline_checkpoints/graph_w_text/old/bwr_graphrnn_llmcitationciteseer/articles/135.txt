Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics or manual tuning, which can be suboptimal and time-consuming. We propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our framework, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal join order and indexing strategy based on query characteristics and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
