Distributed database systems have become a cornerstone of modern data management, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraphIX', which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to facilitate efficient query execution. By partitioning the query graph into sub-graphs and indexing them using a hierarchical clustering scheme, GraphIX reduces the number of network hops and improves query response times. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphIX outperforms existing indexing schemes by up to 30% in terms of query latency.
