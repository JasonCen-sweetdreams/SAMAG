Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way humans interact with digital environments. However, creating an immersive experience that caters to individual users' preferences remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR. We designed an experiment using a novel avatar-generation algorithm that incorporates users' personality traits, demographics, and behavioral data. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, satisfaction, and emotional investment compared to those using generic avatars. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR experiences that maximize user engagement and overall well-being.
