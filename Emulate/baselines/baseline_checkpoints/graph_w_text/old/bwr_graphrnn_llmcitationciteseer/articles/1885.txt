Multi-agent systems have numerous applications in areas like autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and rescue operations. However, task allocation remains a significant challenge, particularly in decentralized settings where agents lack global knowledge. This paper proposes a novel approach to decentralized task allocation using reinforcement learning (RL). We introduce a multi-agent RL framework, 'DTRL', which enables agents to learn task allocation policies through interactions with their environment. Experimental results demonstrate that DTRL achieves near-optimal task allocation performance in various scenarios, outperforming traditional methods like contract net protocol and auction-based approaches.
