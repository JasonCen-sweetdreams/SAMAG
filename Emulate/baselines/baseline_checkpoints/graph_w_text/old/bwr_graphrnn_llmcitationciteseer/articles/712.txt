Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the heterogeneity of modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features at different levels of abstraction. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention modules and a fusion attention module, which jointly learn to recognize emotions from multi-modal data. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in emotion recognition accuracy and robustness.
