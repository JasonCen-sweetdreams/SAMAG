Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the impact of dialogue flow and error recovery on the usability of voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65-85, analyzing their interactions with a custom-built voice assistant. Our results show that a more conversational dialogue flow and proactive error recovery strategies significantly improve task completion rates and user satisfaction. We provide design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants and highlight future research directions for HCI in this area.
