Efficient task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with distinct capabilities must adapt to changing environmental conditions. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized, actor-critic framework, 'AgentDRL', which enables agents to learn optimal task assignment policies through experience and communication. Our experiments demonstrate that AgentDRL outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate, resource utilization, and adaptability to dynamic environments.
