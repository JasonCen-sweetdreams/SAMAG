Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to enhance the query representation to better match relevant documents. This paper proposes a neural semantic embedding-based approach, 'NSE-QE', which leverages pre-trained language models to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. We introduce a novel ranking mechanism that incorporates both local and global context to select the most informative expansion terms. Our experiments on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
