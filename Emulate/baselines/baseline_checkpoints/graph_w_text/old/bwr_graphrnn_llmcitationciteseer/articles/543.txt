Traditional search engines often return redundant results, degrading user experience. This paper presents a novel neural re-ranking approach, 'DiversiRank', which leverages click-based feedback to promote diversified search results. DiversiRank models user behavior using a hierarchical attention mechanism, capturing both query-level and document-level interactions. We incorporate a regularizer to encourage diverse results, and demonstrate significant improvements in novelty and diversity metrics on a large-scale search engine dataset. Experiments also show that DiversiRank outperforms state-of-the-art re-ranking methods in terms of user engagement and satisfaction.
