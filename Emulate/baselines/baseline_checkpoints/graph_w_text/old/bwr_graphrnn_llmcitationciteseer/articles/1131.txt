Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the relevance and diversity of search results. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion, leveraging deep semantic analysis to capture nuanced relationships between terms. Our method, 'DeepQE', employs a graph neural network to encode term embeddings and a attention-based mechanism to generate expanded queries. Experiments on the TREC benchmark dataset demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly for complex queries.
