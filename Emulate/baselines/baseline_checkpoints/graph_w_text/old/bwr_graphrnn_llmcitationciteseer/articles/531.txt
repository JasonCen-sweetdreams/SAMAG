Recommendation systems have become increasingly important in today's digital landscape. However, most existing methods struggle to scale to large user-item graphs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both node and graph-level attention mechanisms to efficiently capture complex relationships. Our model is validated on several real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
