Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various information retrieval tasks, but they often suffer from the cold start problem. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuQE', that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to improve the retrieval performance of neural models. NeuQE uses a neural ranker to select the most relevant documents and then expands the original query using the top-ranked documents. We evaluate NeuQE on several benchmark datasets and show that it significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision.
