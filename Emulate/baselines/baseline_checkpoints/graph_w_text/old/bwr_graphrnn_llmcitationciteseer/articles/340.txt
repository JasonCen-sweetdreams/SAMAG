In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn agent embeddings and allocate tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. Our approach, called 'GraphAgent', uses a hierarchical GNN architecture to model the complex dependencies between agents and tasks, and achieves significant improvements in task allocation efficiency and fairness compared to traditional methods. We evaluate GraphAgent on a real-world disaster response scenario and demonstrate its effectiveness in dynamic and uncertain environments.
