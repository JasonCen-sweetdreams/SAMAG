The proliferation of neural retrieval models has led to a surge in memory and computational requirements, hindering their deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces 'NeurIx', a novel indexing framework that leverages the sparse activations of neural networks to reduce memory footprint and accelerate query processing. We propose a hierarchical indexing scheme that adaptively partitions the neural embedding space, resulting in significant speedups and memory savings without compromising retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of NeurIx in enabling efficient neural retrieval for large-scale information retrieval applications.
