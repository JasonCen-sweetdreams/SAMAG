This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. We propose a distributed, asynchronous algorithm that enables agents to learn from their local interactions and adapt to dynamic task availability. Our approach addresses the challenges of partial observability, communication constraints, and conflicting agent goals, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overheads in simulated environments. We evaluate our framework using a variety of task allocation scenarios, showcasing its applicability to real-world domains such as disaster response and autonomous robotics.
