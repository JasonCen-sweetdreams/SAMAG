Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, optimizing query execution in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time, while reducing the number of optimization iterations by 50%
