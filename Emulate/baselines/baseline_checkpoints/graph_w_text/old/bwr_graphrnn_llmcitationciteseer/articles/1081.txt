Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. We propose a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that integrates multi-scale attention mechanisms to detect anomalies and provide explanations. HAN consists of a temporal attention module that captures long-term dependencies and a spatial attention module that highlights relevant features. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for anomaly occurrences.
