Temporal graph queries are essential for various applications, such as social network analysis and traffic pattern mining. However, existing indexing techniques suffer from high memory overhead and slow query performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, Hierarchical Bloom Filter Index (HBF-I), which leverages the hierarchical structure of temporal graphs to reduce memory usage and accelerate query execution. HBF-I uses a combination of Bloom filters and compact bit vectors to efficiently store and query temporal graph data. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HBF-I outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 5x in query performance and 3x in memory efficiency.
