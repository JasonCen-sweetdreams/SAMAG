This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for optimal resource allocation in smart grids. We model the problem as a Markov game, where each agent represents a microgrid and aims to maximize its own reward while minimizing the global carbon footprint. Our approach leverages a novel communication protocol that enables agents to share information and coordinate their actions without revealing private data. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid environment demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional centralized optimization techniques and achieves better scalability and robustness in the presence of faults and uncertainties.
