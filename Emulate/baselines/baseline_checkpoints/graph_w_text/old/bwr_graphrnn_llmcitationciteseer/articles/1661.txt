Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely on effective query expansion techniques to improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQERL', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion. We formulate query expansion as a Markov decision process and train a deep Q-network to select the most informative expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQERL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
