Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using machine learning techniques. We develop a deep neural network-based query optimizer that learns from historical query patterns and adapts to changing workloads. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database system shows that our approach achieves significant performance improvements over traditional query optimization techniques, with an average reduction in query execution time of 30%.
