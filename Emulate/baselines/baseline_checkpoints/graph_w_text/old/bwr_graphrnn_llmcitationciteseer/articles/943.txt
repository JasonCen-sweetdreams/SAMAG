Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments often require efficient negotiation mechanisms to achieve their goals. This paper proposes a decentralized negotiation framework, 'DyNA', which enables agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and negotiate with each other in real-time. DyNA combines a graph-based negotiation protocol with a novel utility function that incorporates contextual information and uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that DyNA outperforms traditional negotiation mechanisms in terms of negotiation speed, agreement rate, and overall system utility in various dynamic scenarios.
