Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information, but the lack of haptic feedback can lead to user disorientation and fatigue. This study investigates the effects of incorporating haptic feedback into VR interfaces on user experience. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR system with varying levels of haptic feedback. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user performance, reduces motion sickness, and enhances overall user satisfaction. We also identify key design guidelines for effectively integrating haptic feedback in VR interfaces.
