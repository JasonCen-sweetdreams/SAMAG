Medical search systems require accurate document ranking to provide relevant information to healthcare professionals. Existing approaches often neglect the hierarchical structure of medical documents and the nuances of context-dependent relevance. We propose a novel context-aware document ranking framework, 'MedHAN', which employs hierarchical attention networks to model the interactions between query, document, and context. Our approach captures the semantic relationships between medical entities and integrates domain knowledge to improve ranking performance. Experiments on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset demonstrate that MedHAN outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
