This paper addresses the problem of coordinating multiple autonomous agents in complex systems. We propose a novel distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) framework that enables agents to make decisions while respecting global constraints. Our approach leverages a hybrid of constraint propagation and local search techniques to efficiently explore the joint decision space. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving near-optimal solutions while reducing communication overhead. The proposed framework has applications in areas such as smart grids, traffic management, and robotic teams.
