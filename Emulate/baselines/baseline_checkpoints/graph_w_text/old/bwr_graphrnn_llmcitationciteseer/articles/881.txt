Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based systems, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. Our framework, 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan from a large space of possible plans. We demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques in terms of execution time and resource utilization on a real-world distributed database system.
