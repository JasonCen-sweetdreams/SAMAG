In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often involve complex interactions and dependencies among agents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable decision making in multi-agent settings. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to model agent interactions and hierarchical representations to capture context-dependent dependencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a simulated traffic management scenario, achieving improved decision accuracy and interpretability compared to baseline methods. Our framework provides a step towards more transparent and trustworthy AI systems in real-world applications.
