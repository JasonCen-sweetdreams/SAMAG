Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution in these systems remains a complex task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
