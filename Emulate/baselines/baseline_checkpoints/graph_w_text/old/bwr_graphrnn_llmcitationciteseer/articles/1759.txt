Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments often face significant barriers to accessing and interacting with VR environments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences, focusing on haptic and auditory feedback mechanisms that can compensate for visual limitations. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with visual impairments, evaluating the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing their sense of presence and overall VR experience. The results demonstrate that our framework can significantly improve the accessibility of VR technology for users with visual impairments.
