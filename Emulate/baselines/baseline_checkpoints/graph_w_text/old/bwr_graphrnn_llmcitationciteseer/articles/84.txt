Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability. We propose a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that detects anomalies while providing insights into the contributing factors. HAN consists of two attention mechanisms: a feature-level attention module that selects relevant features and a temporal attention module that identifies critical time segments. We evaluate HAN on three real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach has significant implications for real-time monitoring systems, enabling swift identification and rectification of anomalies.
