Voice-based interfaces have the potential to improve the accessibility and usability of technology for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing voice assistants often fail to account for the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyVoice', a novel voice-based interface tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops and usability studies to inform the design of EasyVoice, which incorporates features such as simplified language, explicit error correction, and personalized feedback. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates compared to existing voice assistants.
