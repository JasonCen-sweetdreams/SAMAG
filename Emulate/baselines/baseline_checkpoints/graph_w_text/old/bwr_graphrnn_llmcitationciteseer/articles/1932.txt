This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, where agents learn to allocate tasks autonomously using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, 'DRL-TA', which utilizes a decentralized actor-critic architecture to optimize task allocation in real-time. Experimental results on a simulated multi-agent environment demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and resource utilization. We also analyze the robustness of our approach under varying agent communication topologies and environmental uncertainties.
