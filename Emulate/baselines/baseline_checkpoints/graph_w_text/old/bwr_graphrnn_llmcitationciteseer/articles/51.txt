Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promise in autonomous vehicle control, but its lack of interpretability hinders trust and reliability. This paper presents XRL, a novel explainable DRL framework that generates visual and semantic explanations for its decision-making process. XRL leverages attention mechanisms and model-based reinforcement learning to identify relevant features and behaviors, providing insights into the policy's decision-making process. We evaluate XRL on a range of autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating improved transparency and controllability without compromising performance.
