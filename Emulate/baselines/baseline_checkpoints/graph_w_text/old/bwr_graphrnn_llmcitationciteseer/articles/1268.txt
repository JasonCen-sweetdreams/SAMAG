This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in the context of virtual reality (VR) interfaces. We investigate how gesture-based interaction can enhance users' cognitive performance and sense of presence in VR environments. Our study involves a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a user study involving 30 participants. The results show that embodied cognition principles can significantly improve task performance and user experience in VR, particularly for tasks requiring spatial reasoning and problem-solving. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more engaging and effective VR interfaces.
