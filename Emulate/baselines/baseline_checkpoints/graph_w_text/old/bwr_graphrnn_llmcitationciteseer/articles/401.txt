Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but their text-based nature can pose significant barriers for individuals with dyslexia. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating accessible conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of people with dyslexia. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with dyslexia, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed interface incorporates multimodal input options, personalized text customization, and real-time feedback mechanisms. A follow-up evaluation with 15 participants demonstrated significant improvements in usability, engagement, and overall user experience.
