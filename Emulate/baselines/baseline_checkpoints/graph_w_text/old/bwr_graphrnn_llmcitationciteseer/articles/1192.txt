We propose a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to efficiently allocate tasks to agents. Our approach, called Graph-TAA, represents the agent-task graph as a learnable embedding, allowing agents to make local decisions based on their own and neighboring agents' attributes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Graph-TAA in reducing communication overhead and improving task completion rates in simulated environments with varying graph structures and agent capabilities. Experimental results show that Graph-TAA outperforms traditional decentralized allocation methods, achieving near-optimal task allocation in complex multi-agent scenarios.
