Ad-hoc search systems struggle to balance retrieval efficiency with semantic accuracy, particularly when handling complex queries. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document embedding framework, 'QADE', which dynamically adjusts the representation of documents based on the query context. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively emphasize relevant document regions and capture nuanced query semantics. Experimental evaluation on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrates that QADE achieves significant improvements in retrieval precision and reduces computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods.
