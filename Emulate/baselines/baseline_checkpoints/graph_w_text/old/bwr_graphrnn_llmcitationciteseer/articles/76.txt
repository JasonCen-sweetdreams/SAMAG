Multivariate time-series forecasting with sensor data is crucial in various applications, such as industrial process control and healthcare monitoring. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, hindering their adoption in high-stakes domains. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that provides explainable forecasting by identifying relevant sensor subsets and their temporal dependencies. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on informative sensor groups and time intervals, enabling the model to adapt to complex data patterns. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HAN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and interpretability.
