In heterogeneous multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents with varying capabilities and resource constraints. This paper proposes a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We formulate the task allocation problem as a DCOP and develop a novel algorithm, HMA-DCOP, that leverages local search and communication between agents to find high-quality solutions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that HMA-DCOP outperforms existing decentralized methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
