In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that involves assigning tasks to agents to maximize overall efficiency. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to coordinate task allocation among agents. Our method, called CARTA, uses a decentralized actor-critic framework to learn task allocation policies that adapt to changing environmental conditions. We evaluate CARTA on a simulated warehouse management scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced latency compared to traditional methods. Our approach can be applied to various domains, including robotics, logistics, and smart cities.
