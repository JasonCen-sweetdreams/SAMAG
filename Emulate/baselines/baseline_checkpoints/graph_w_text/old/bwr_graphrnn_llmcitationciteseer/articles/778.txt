Traditional chatbots in e-commerce often struggle to understand users' emotional cues, leading to frustration and cart abandonment. We propose an emotion-aware chatbot framework that leverages multimodal sentiment analysis and empathetic response generation. Our approach integrates machine learning models for emotion detection from text and speech, and generates personalized responses that acknowledge and validate users' emotions. A user study with 100 participants shows that our framework significantly improves user satisfaction and increases purchase intent compared to traditional chatbots.
