Traditional document retrieval methods rely on static indexing and ranking techniques, which can lead to suboptimal performance under varying query distributions. This paper presents a novel approach, 'QueryEmb', which adaptively re-ranks documents based on query-dependent embeddings. Our method leverages a transformer-based architecture to generate contextualized query representations, which are then used to refine the ranking of retrieved documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QueryEmb outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and mean reciprocal rank, while reducing the computational overhead of re-ranking.
