Anomaly detection in high-dimensional data is a challenging task, especially when dealing with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, 'HiCAD', that leverages self-supervised learning to identify anomalies without requiring explicit labels. We introduce a novel hierarchical representation learning scheme that captures local and global patterns in the data, enabling the detection of subtle anomalies. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HiCAD in improving anomaly detection performance, particularly in high-dimensional settings.
