Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in such systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize queries based on the system's workload and performance metrics. The framework is capable of adapting to changing workloads and optimizing queries in real-time. Experimental results on a realistic dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and system resource utilization.
