Real-time database systems require efficient concurrency control mechanisms to ensure predictable and reliable performance. This paper presents a novel approach to optimize concurrency control for real-time database systems, focusing on the trade-off between responsiveness and consistency. We propose a dynamic adaptation mechanism that adjusts the concurrency control strategy based on workload characteristics and system resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-time database benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in throughput and latency, while maintaining strong consistency guarantees.
