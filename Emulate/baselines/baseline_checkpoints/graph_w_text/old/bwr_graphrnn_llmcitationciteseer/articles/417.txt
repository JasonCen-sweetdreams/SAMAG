Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but the quality of user experience (UX) remains a major concern. This paper investigates the effect of haptic feedback on UX in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, who performed a series of tasks with and without haptic feedback. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves task completion time, reduces user frustration, and increases overall satisfaction. We also analyzed the physiological responses of participants, including heart rate and skin conductance, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of haptic feedback on UX in VR.
