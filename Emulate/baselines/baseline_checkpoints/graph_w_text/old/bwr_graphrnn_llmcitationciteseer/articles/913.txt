The proliferation of fake news on social media has severe consequences for individuals and society. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAT-GNN) for fake news detection. Our approach leverages the graph structure of news articles, user interactions, and semantic embeddings to identify suspicious patterns. The hierarchical attention mechanism enables the model to focus on relevant information and mitigate the impact of noisy data. Experimental results on a large-scale news dataset demonstrate that HAT-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art fake news detection methods, achieving an F1-score of 0.93.
