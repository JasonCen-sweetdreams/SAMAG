Traditional keyword-based search systems often struggle to capture the nuances of complex user queries, leading to suboptimal document retrieval results. This paper proposes a novel approach to neural query graph generation, which learns to represent queries as graph structures incorporating semantic relationships between entities, keywords, and concepts. Our model, dubbed 'QueryGraph', is trained on a large-scale dataset of annotated queries and documents, and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art keyword-based and neural ranking models.
