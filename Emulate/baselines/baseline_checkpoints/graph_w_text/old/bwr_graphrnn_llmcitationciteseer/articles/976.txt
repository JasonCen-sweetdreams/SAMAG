Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it aims to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. However, traditional methods rely on manually crafted rules and heuristics, which may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach, 'SemExp', that leverages semantic embeddings to expand queries. We design a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query representation, semantic similarity, and relevance ranking. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemExp outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, improving retrieval effectiveness by up to 15%.
