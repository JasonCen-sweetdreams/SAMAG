Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling massive amounts of data. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing approach that dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. Our approach, called AIQ, leverages machine learning algorithms to predict query hotspots and adaptively creates or drops indexes to minimize query latency. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AIQ achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance compared to traditional indexing methods.
