Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR interfaces can be inaccessible and overwhelming. This paper presents the results of a user-centered design study, in which we co-created a set of inclusive VR interface design guidelines with older adults with cognitive impairments and their caregivers. We developed and evaluated a prototype VR system that incorporates these guidelines, featuring simplified navigation, personalized learning, and cognitive support. Our results show significant improvements in user engagement, satisfaction, and cognitive load reduction, demonstrating the potential of inclusive VR design to promote digital inclusion and cognitive accessibility.
