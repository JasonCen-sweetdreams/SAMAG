This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities must collaborate to achieve complex goals. We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that learns to coordinate task assignments based on agent strengths, task requirements, and environmental dynamics. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate, response time, and robustness to agent failures.
