Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph learning, where the goal is to classify nodes in a graph with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant subgraphs and nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-shot node classification tasks. Our experiments show that HGAT can adapt to varying graph structures and generalize well to unseen nodes and graphs.
