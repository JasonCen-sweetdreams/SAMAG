Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is a crucial task with numerous applications in network security, finance, and healthcare. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results, they often struggle to capture complex node relationships and contextual information. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attentional Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) framework, which incorporates multi-scale attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs. Our experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and scalability.
