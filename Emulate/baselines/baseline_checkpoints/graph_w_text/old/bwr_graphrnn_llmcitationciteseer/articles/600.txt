Virtual reality (VR) has transformed human-computer interaction, but designing intuitive interfaces remains a challenge. This paper investigates the role of embodiment in VR, focusing on gesture-based interaction design. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, analyzing their gestures and movement patterns in a VR environment. Our results show that incorporating bodily awareness and proprioception into interaction design can significantly improve user experience and task performance. We propose a novel framework, 'Embodied Gestures', which integrates kinesthetic and tactile feedback to enhance immersion and reduce cognitive load. The findings have implications for VR applications in education, training, and therapy.
