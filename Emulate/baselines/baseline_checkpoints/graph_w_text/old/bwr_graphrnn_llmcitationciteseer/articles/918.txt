Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their usability for older adults remains a concern. This study investigates the impact of cognitive load on error recovery in voice-assisted interactions. We designed an accessible voice assistant prototype that incorporates cognitive support features, such as step-by-step instructions and error feedback. A user study with 30 older adults (ages 65-85) revealed that our prototype significantly reduced cognitive load and improved error recovery rates compared to a commercial voice assistant. Our findings provide insights into designing more accessible and user-centered voice assistants for older adults, promoting digital inclusion and independence.
