Distributed database systems are increasingly used to manage large-scale datasets. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and network communication. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DistroOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and graph-based query rewriting. We demonstrate that DistroOpt achieves significant performance improvements compared to traditional query optimization techniques, particularly for complex queries with multiple joins and aggregations. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that DistroOpt reduces query execution time by up to 50% while maintaining high accuracy and scalability.
