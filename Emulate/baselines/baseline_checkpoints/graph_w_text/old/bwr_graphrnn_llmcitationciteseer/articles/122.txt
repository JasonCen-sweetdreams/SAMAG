Diverse document retrieval is a crucial task in information retrieval, which aims to retrieve a set of documents that cover various aspects of a query. Existing methods often rely on hand-crafted features or simple graph-based models, which may not capture complex relationships between documents. We propose a novel approach, Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Networks (H-GCN), which represents documents as hierarchical graphs and leverages graph convolutional layers to learn rich semantic features. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that H-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of diversity, relevance, and efficiency.
