Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our HAN model consists of a hierarchical structure of attention modules, which learn to capture complex patterns and relationships in time-series data. We evaluate our approach on four real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting anomalies while providing interpretable explanations. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of detection accuracy and F1-score.
