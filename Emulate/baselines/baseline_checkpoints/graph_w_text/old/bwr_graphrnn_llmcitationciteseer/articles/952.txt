This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent pathfinding, a challenging problem in artificial intelligence and robotics. Our method, Hierarchical Graph Decomposition (HGD), exploits the hierarchical structure of real-world graphs to efficiently compute collision-free paths for multiple agents. HGD recursively decomposes the graph into smaller subgraphs, solving a sequence of smaller pathfinding problems that can be solved in parallel. We demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of HGD on large-scale graphs, achieving up to 10x speedup over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining optimality guarantees.
