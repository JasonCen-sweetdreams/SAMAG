Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships. However, optimizing queries in distributed graph databases remains a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of graph data and the need to balance query performance with data consistency. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph structural properties to prune the search space and reduce query latency. We also develop a cost-based optimization algorithm that takes into account data distribution and network topology. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
