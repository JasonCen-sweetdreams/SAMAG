The increasing adoption of cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DaaS) platforms has led to a surge in multi-tenancy, where multiple clients share the same database instance. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'TenantAware', that leverages machine learning-based prediction models to optimize query execution plans for multi-tenant DaaS platforms. TenantAware incorporates tenant-specific workload patterns and resource utilization to minimize query latency and improve overall system throughput. Experimental results using a real-world DaaS platform demonstrate that TenantAware reduces average query latency by up to 35% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
