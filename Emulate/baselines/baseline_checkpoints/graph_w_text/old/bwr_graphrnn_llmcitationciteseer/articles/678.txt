The cold start problem in e-commerce recommendation systems refers to the challenge of providing personalized recommendations to new users or items with limited interaction history. This paper presents a novel ranking model adaptation approach that leverages transfer learning and meta-learning to adapt to new domains and items. Our approach, called 'AdaRank', uses a meta-learner to learn a domain-invariant ranking model that can be fine-tuned for specific domains and items. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset show that AdaRank significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cold start recommendation methods, achieving an average precision improvement of 23.1%.
