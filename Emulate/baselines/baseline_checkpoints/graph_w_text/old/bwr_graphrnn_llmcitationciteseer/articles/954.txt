As robots increasingly enter human-centric workspaces, effective collaboration and coordination between humans and robots become crucial. This paper explores the role of embodiment in human-robot collaboration, examining how the physical presence and anthropomorphic design of robots influence human behavior and performance. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, comparing collaboration outcomes with a humanoid robot and a screen-based interface. Our results show that embodied robots elicit more trust and engagement from humans, leading to improved task efficiency and reduced errors. We discuss implications for the design of future human-robot collaboration systems.
