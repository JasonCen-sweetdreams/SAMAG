Distributed database systems are increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems is a complex problem due to the numerous possible query plans and the dynamic nature of the system. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the system and demonstrates significant performance improvements over traditional optimization techniques. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach can reduce query execution times by up to 30% compared to existing methods.
