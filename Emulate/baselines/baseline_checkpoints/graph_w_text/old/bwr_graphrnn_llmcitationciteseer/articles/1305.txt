The proliferation of IoT devices has led to a surge in resource allocation challenges. This paper presents a decentralized autonomous agent-based system, 'DAA-IoT', which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize resource allocation in IoT networks. DAA-IoT consists of autonomous agents that interact with their environment and learn to make decisions based on local observations. We propose a novel communication protocol that enables agents to share knowledge and adapt to changing network conditions. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that DAA-IoT achieves significant improvements in resource allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional centralized approaches.
