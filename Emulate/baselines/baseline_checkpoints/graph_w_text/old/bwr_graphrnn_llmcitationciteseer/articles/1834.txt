Virtual reality (VR) technology has shown promise in enhancing learning experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR-based learning environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic one. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, as measured by dwell time, interaction frequency, and self-reported enjoyment. We also found that personalized avatars particularly benefited users with lower prior experience with VR technology. The findings have implications for the design of VR-based learning systems, highlighting the potential of personalized avatars to increase user motivation and participation.
