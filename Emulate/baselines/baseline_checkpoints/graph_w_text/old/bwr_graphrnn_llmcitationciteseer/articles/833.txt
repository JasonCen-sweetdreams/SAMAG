Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks, but their robustness to adversarial attacks remains a concern. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach to generate adversarial attacks on GNNs. We leverage the concept of meta-learning to learn a universal perturbation strategy that can be adapted to different GNN architectures and graph structures. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully attack various GNN models, including GraphSAGE and Graph Attention Networks, with high attack success rates. We also show that our approach can be used to improve the robustness of GNNs by generating robust models through adversarial training.
