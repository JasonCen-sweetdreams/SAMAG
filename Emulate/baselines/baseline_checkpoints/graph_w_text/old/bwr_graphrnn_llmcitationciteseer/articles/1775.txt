In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages adaptive auction mechanisms to allocate tasks to agents. Our approach dynamically adjusts the auction parameters based on the agents' performance and task priorities, ensuring efficient allocation and minimizing communication overhead. We evaluate our framework through extensive simulations and demonstrate its scalability and robustness in various scenarios, including task failures and agent additions/removals.
