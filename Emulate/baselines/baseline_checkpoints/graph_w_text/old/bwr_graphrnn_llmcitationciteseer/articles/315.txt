Optimizing query execution plans in distributed database systems is a complex problem, particularly in the presence of varying workloads and data distributions. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select optimal query plans. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that balances query latency and resource utilization. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource efficiency compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
