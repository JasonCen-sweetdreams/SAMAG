Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in Information Retrieval (IR). This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, dubbed 'Doc2Emb', which leverages document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. By projecting query terms into the document embedding space, we can identify relevant expansion terms that are contextually similar to the original query. Experiments on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that Doc2Emb outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as Rocchio and KL-divergence, in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
