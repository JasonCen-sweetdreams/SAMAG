Real-time database systems require efficient concurrency control mechanisms to ensure consistency and responsiveness. This paper presents a novel multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) approach, 'RT-MVCC', designed for high-throughput and low-latency transactions. RT-MVCC exploits transaction semantics to reduce version management overhead and employs a hybrid validation mechanism that combines logical timestamps with physical clock synchronization. Our experiments on a real-time database benchmark demonstrate that RT-MVCC outperforms existing MVCC schemes by up to 30% in terms of transaction throughput while maintaining strong consistency guarantees.
