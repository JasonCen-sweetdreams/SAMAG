In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often rely on complex interactions between agents. However, the lack of transparency in these interactions hinders the interpretability and trustworthiness of the resulting decisions. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision-making. By incorporating attention mechanisms at both intra-agent and inter-agent levels, HAN enables the identification of key factors influencing agent decisions and facilitates the visualization of decision-making processes. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in improving decision quality while providing insightful explanations.
