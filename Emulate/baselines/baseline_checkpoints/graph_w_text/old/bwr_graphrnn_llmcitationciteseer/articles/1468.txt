This paper proposes a neural ranking model for document retrieval that incorporates query expansion techniques to improve retrieval effectiveness. Our approach, dubbed 'NeuRank+', leverages a deep neural network to learn a latent representation of documents and queries. We introduce a novel query expansion method that adaptively selects relevant terms from the top-retrieved documents to augment the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuRank+ outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models and traditional retrieval methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
