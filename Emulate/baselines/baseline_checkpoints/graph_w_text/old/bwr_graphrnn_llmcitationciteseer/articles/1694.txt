Multi-agent dialogue systems have become increasingly popular in various applications, including customer service and entertainment. However, the lack of transparency and explainability in these systems hinders their adoption in high-stakes scenarios. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent dialogue systems. Our approach utilizes attention mechanisms to highlight relevant contexts and agent interactions, providing insights into the decision-making process. Experimental results on a large-scale dialogue dataset demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both task performance and explainability.
