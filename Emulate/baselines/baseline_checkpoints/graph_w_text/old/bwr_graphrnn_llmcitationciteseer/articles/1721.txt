Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly popular, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice-based interfaces for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings led to the development of 'CAREVoice', a novel interface that incorporates cognitive support features, such as personalized prompts, memory aids, and error forgiveness. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice-based interfaces.
