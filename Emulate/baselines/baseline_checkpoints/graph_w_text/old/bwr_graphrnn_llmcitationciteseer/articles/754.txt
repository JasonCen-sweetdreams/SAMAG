In many real-world applications, multi-agent systems (MAS) must operate in scenarios with asynchronous communication and uncertainty. This paper presents a novel framework for coordinating MAS in such environments. We propose an asynchronous distributed algorithm that leverages probabilistic graphical models to reason about uncertainty and make decisions. Our approach is evaluated on a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved response times and reduced uncertainty compared to existing synchronous methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's convergence properties under varying levels of communication delay and uncertainty.
