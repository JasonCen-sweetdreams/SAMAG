Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to refine the original query to better capture user intent. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'DeepQE', that leverages the strengths of both lexical and semantic query expansion techniques. Our approach utilizes a multi-task learning framework to jointly learn query representation, term weighting, and ranking functions. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
