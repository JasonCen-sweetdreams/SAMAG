In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages auction-based mechanisms to enable autonomous agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. We introduce a novel bidding strategy that incorporates agent preferences, task priorities, and communication constraints, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulations involving teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) performing search and rescue operations. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time, agent satisfaction, and robustness to failures.
