Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but their effectiveness for older adults with cognitive impairments remains limited. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible conversational interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and clinicians to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our results inform the development of a novel interface framework, 'CARE', which incorporates simplicity, clarity, and error forgiveness to facilitate successful interactions. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing commercial systems.
