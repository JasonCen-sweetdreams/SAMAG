Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. One of the most effective techniques for improving retrieval performance is query expansion, which involves adding relevant terms to the original query. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. Our model, called DeepQE, learns to predict relevant expansion terms based on the semantic relationships between the query terms and the documents in the collection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DeepQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving up to 20% improvement in retrieval performance.
