Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complex and dynamic nature of graph data. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed graph databases. Our method, called GraphRL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the graph structure, query patterns, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphRL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
