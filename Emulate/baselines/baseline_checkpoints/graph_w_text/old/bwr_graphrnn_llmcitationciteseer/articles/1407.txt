Time-series databases have become ubiquitous in IoT, finance, and healthcare, but efficient querying remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, Hierarchical Bloom Filter Index (HBFI), which leverages the hierarchical structure of Bloom filters to accelerate range queries on time-series data. Our approach exploits the sparsity of time-series data to reduce the number of filter lookups, achieving an average speedup of 3.2x over state-of-the-art indexing methods. We evaluate HBFI on a real-world IoT dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing query latency and improving throughput.
