In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn agent-agent and agent-task relationships. Our approach, called 'GNN-TA', uses a distributed GNN architecture to enable agents to learn from their local neighborhoods and make task allocation decisions without relying on a central authority. We evaluate GNN-TA on a range of synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional methods.
