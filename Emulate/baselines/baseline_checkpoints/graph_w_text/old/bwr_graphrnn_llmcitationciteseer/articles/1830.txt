Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-structured data, where a model must generalize to unseen classes with limited labeled instances. This paper proposes a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages both local and global graph structures to adapt to novel classes. HGAN employs a meta-learning framework to train a set of attention mechanisms that can be easily adapted to new classes. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot node classification tasks, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin.
