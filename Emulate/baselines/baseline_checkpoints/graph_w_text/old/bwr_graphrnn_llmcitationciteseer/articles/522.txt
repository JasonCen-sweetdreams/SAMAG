Main-memory databases have become increasingly popular due to their high performance capabilities. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge, particularly for complex queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using learned index structures. We introduce a machine learning-based framework that learns to predict the optimal query plan based on historical query patterns and database statistics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while maintaining a low overhead in terms of indexing and maintenance costs.
