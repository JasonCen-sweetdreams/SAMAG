Distributed database systems face significant challenges in handling multi-dimensional range queries, particularly when dealing with large datasets and high query loads. This paper introduces a novel indexing technique, 'Ranger', which exploits the spatial locality of data points to reduce the number of nodes involved in query processing. Ranger utilizes a hierarchical, grid-based indexing structure that adaptively adjusts to the data distribution, resulting in improved query performance and reduced communication overhead. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that Ranger outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time and 2x in terms of network bandwidth usage.
