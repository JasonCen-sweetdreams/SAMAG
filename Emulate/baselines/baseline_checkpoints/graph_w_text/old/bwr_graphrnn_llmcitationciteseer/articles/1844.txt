In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach, 'RL-TA', that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignment among agents. By formulating the task allocation problem as a Markov decision process, we train a deep Q-network to learn policies that maximize system-wide utility. We evaluate RL-TA on a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional heuristic-based methods.
