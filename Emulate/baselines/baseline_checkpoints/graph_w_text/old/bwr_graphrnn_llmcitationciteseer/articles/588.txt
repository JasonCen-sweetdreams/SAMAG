In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often involve complex interactions and dependencies between agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making by modeling agent relationships and attention mechanisms. Our approach integrates graph attention networks with hierarchical clustering to identify influential agents and critical decision factors. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate that our HAN-based framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of decision accuracy and interpretability, while providing insights into collective decision-making dynamics.
