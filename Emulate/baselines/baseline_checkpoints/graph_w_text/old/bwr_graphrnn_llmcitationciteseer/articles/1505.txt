Novice programmers often experience high cognitive load, leading to frustration and decreased motivation. Gamification has been proposed as a potential solution, but its effectiveness in this context remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of gamification on cognitive load in novice programmers. We designed a gamified coding environment, 'CodeQuest', which incorporates rewards, leaderboards, and social sharing features. Our user study with 40 participants shows that CodeQuest significantly reduces cognitive load and improves coding performance compared to a traditional coding environment. We also identify specific gamification elements that contribute to this reduction, providing insights for future research and practical applications.
