In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach, 'GraphAgent', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task allocation policies. Each agent maintains a local GNN that incorporates information from neighboring agents, enabling adaptive decision-making without relying on centralized controllers. We evaluate GraphAgent on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional auction-based methods.
