Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics or manual tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, 'RL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal plan based on query characteristics and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-QO outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
