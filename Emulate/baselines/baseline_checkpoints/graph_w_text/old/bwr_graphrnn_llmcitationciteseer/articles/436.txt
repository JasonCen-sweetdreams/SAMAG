Explainability in recommendation systems is crucial for building trust with users. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that incorporates both item and user embeddings to generate personalized explanations. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between items and users, and hierarchical pooling to capture multi-scale dependencies. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
