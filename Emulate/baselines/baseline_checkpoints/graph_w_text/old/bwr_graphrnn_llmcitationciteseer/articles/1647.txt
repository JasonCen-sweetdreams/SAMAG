Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraphIndex', which leverages the structural properties of data graphs to accelerate query execution. By representing data relationships as a graph and indexing it using a hierarchical clustering scheme, GraphIndex reduces the query response time by up to 40% compared to traditional indexing methods. We evaluate GraphIndex on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving query performance in DDS.
