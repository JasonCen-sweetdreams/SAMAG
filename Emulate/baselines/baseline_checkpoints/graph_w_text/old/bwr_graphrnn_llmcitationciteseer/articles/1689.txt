We present a novel approach to multi-agent task allocation using deep graph reinforcement learning. Our method, called GraphMARL, leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and task dependencies, and uses reinforcement learning to learn an optimal task allocation policy. We demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of GraphMARL in large-scale simulations, achieving significant improvements over traditional methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization. Our approach has potential applications in autonomous systems, smart cities, and disaster response scenarios.
