Optimizing query execution plans in distributed relational databases is a complex problem due to the exponential growth of possible plans. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics or manual tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. Our method, 'RL-Opt', learns to predict optimal plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution times. We evaluate RL-Opt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate improved performance compared to state-of-the-art optimizers, with an average speedup of 2.5x.
