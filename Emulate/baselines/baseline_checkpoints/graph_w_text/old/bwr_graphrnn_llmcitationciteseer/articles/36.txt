This paper proposes a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to model complex agent interactions. We introduce a hierarchical GNN architecture that learns to represent agents, tasks, and their relationships, enabling efficient and adaptive task assignment. Our approach is evaluated on a range of simulated scenarios, demonstrating improved performance and scalability compared to traditional optimization-based methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed algorithm's convergence properties and robustness to agent failures.
