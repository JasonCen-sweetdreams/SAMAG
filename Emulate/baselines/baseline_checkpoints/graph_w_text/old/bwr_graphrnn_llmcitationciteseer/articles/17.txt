In multi-agent systems, resource allocation is a critical problem, and auctions have emerged as a promising solution. However, existing auction mechanisms often rely on simplistic assumptions about agent behavior, leading to suboptimal outcomes. This paper proposes a novel, game-theoretic approach to designing intelligent auction mechanisms that incorporate agent-specific utility functions and learning capabilities. Our framework, 'AgentAuction', leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing agent preferences and market conditions, thereby improving overall system efficiency and fairness. Experimental results on a simulated cloud computing platform demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentAuction in achieving near-optimal resource allocation.
