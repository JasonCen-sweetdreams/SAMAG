Explainability is crucial in autonomous vehicles, as it enables understanding of the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Explainable Reinforcement Learning (HAERL) framework for autonomous vehicles. HAERL integrates hierarchical attention mechanisms to identify salient features and explainable reinforcement learning to provide interpretable decision-making. We evaluate HAERL on a real-world autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate improved explainability and performance compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.
