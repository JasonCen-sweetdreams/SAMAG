Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large datasets. However, efficient indexing mechanisms for multi-dimensional range queries remain a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing technique, 'Ranger', which leverages a combination of grid-based indexing and distributed bitmap compression to accelerate query processing. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Ranger outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time, while maintaining a comparable storage overhead.
