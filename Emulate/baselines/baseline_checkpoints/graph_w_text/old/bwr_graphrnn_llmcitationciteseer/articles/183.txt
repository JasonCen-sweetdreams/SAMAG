Distributed graph databases are increasingly used in various applications, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a complex challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a scalable framework, 'GraphOpt', which learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database and observing the execution time. GraphOpt uses a graph neural network to represent the query plan and a deep Q-network to learn the optimization policy. Experimental results on a popular graph database show that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques, reducing query execution time by up to 50%.
