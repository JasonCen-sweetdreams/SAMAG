Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. We propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the database schema and optimize query execution plans. Our method, called GNN-QO, learns to predict the optimal execution plan by analyzing the graph structure of the database and the query workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that GNN-QO outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and reduces the number of communication rounds by 25%.
