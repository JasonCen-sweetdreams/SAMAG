Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query optimization for join operations remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach, called 'DistributedJoinOpt', which leverages a combination of statistical models and machine learning techniques to optimize join orders and reduce communication overhead. Our approach is robust to data skew and adapts to changing data distributions, outperforming existing optimization methods in experiments on the TPC-H benchmark.
