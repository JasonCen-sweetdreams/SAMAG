This paper presents the design and evaluation of an emotional support agent, 'ECHO', tailored for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ECHO integrates natural language processing, computer vision, and affective computing to recognize and respond to emotional cues. Our mixed-methods study with 20 children with ASD reveals that ECHO increases emotional expression, reduces anxiety, and enhances social engagement. We contribute a taxonomy of emotional support strategies for ASD and demonstrate the potential of ECHO as a complementary tool for therapists and caregivers.
