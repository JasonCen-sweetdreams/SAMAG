This paper proposes a novel approach to real-time conflict resolution in multi-agent systems using hierarchical reinforcement learning. Our method, called HRL-Conflict, leverages a hierarchical framework to decompose the conflict resolution problem into smaller sub-problems, which are then solved using reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HRL-Conflict in a variety of simulated scenarios, including air traffic control and autonomous vehicles. Results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of conflict resolution rate and computational efficiency.
