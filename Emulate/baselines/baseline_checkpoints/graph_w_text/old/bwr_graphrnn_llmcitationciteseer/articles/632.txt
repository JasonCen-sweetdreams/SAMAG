As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly popular, understanding user engagement is crucial for creating effective VR experiences. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user engagement in VR. We designed a study with 120 participants, exploring the effects of customized avatars on user satisfaction, sense of presence, and emotional arousal. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly improve user engagement, particularly among users with high self-identity scores. We also identify key factors influencing avatar customization, such as facial similarity and body type accuracy. These findings have implications for the design of VR systems, highlighting the importance of personalized avatars in fostering immersive and engaging experiences.
