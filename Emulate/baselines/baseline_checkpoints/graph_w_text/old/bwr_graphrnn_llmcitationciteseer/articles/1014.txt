Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuroExpan', which learns to expand queries by capturing semantic relationships between words in the query and document spaces. We propose a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query-document similarity and word embeddings, outperforming traditional expansion methods on several benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that NeuroExpan improves retrieval performance by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision, while reducing computational overhead by 30%.
