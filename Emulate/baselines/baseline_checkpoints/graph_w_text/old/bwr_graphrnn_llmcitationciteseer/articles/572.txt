E-commerce search engines rely on effective document representation to retrieve relevant products. This paper presents a novel hypergraph-based document representation approach, 'HyperRep', which models complex relationships between products, attributes, and categories. HyperRep incorporates a graph neural network to learn dense embeddings, enabling more accurate retrieval and improved handling of ambiguity and synonymy. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods.
