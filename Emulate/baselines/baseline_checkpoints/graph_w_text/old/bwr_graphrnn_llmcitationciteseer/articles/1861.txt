Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. While deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability, making it difficult to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that integrates local and global attention mechanisms to detect anomalies in time-series data. We demonstrate that HAN outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides interpretable results, enabling domain experts to identify the contributing factors to anomalies. Experimental results on real-world datasets show the efficacy of HAN in detecting anomalies in stock prices, healthcare data, and network traffic.
