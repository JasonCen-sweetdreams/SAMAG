Emotion recognition from multi-modal data (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the varying importance of different modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and time-steps to improve emotion recognition accuracy. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention modules and a hierarchical fusion module that captures cross-modal interactions. Experiments on the IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 10% increase in weighted F1-score and a 20% reduction in inference time.
