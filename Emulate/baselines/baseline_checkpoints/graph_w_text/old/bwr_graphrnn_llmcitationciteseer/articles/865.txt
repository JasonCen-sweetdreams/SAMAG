Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the need to consider data distribution and communication costs. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph summarization and selectivity estimation to reduce query execution times. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world graph dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing query optimization techniques.
