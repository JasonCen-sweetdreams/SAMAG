Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant contexts for answer extraction. This paper presents a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) framework that leverages both coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic representations to retrieve passages. Our approach involves a two-stage process: first, a coarse-grained retriever selects top-k passages based on their semantic similarity to the question, and then a fine-grained reranker refines the ranking using dense passage representations. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR achieves state-of-the-art passage retrieval performance with significant computational efficiency gains.
