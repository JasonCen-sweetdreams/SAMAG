Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing queries across multiple tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query optimization, which captures the complex relationships between queries, tenants, and database resources. Our method, called 'GraphOpt', leverages graph neural networks to learn a compact representation of the query graph and predict optimal query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 40% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
