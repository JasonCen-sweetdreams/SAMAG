Coordinating multiple agents to achieve a common goal is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper presents a novel approach that combines distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) with reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently coordinate agents. We propose a decentralized RL framework where each agent learns to optimize its local constraints while taking into account the constraints of neighboring agents. Experimental results on a simulated resource allocation problem show that our approach outperforms traditional DCOP methods in terms of solution quality and convergence speed, while scaling to large numbers of agents.
