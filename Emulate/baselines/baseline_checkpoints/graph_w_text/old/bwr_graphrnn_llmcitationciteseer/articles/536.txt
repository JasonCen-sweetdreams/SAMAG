Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing interfaces often pose significant accessibility barriers. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CARE-VR', a novel VR interface tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We employed a participatory design approach, involving older adults with cognitive impairments in the design process. Our evaluation results show that CARE-VR significantly improves user experience, task completion rates, and cognitive load compared to traditional VR interfaces.
