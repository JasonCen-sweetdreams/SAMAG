Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to creating inclusive VR experiences for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and clinicians to identify key design requirements. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, familiarity, and social support in VR interfaces. We developed a proof-of-concept VR system that incorporates these design principles, and evaluated its usability and effectiveness with a group of older adults with mild cognitive impairment.
