Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize learning experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effectiveness of gamification elements in enhancing user engagement in VR-based learning environments. We present a user study with 120 participants, where we designed and implemented a VR-based educational platform with varying levels of gamification. Our results show that gamification significantly improves user engagement, with participants in the gamified condition exhibiting higher levels of motivation, enjoyment, and knowledge retention. We also identify key design factors that influence the effectiveness of gamification in VR-based learning.
