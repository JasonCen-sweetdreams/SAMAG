This paper introduces HierDPR, a novel approach for efficient passage retrieval in open-domain question answering. We propose a hierarchical dense representation framework that leverages a combination of coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic encoders to effectively capture the nuances of question-passage relationships. Our experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HierDPR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while also providing interpretable results through attention-based visualization.
