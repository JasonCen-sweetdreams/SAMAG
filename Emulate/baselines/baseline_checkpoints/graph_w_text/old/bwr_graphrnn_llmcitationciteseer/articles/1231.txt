Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern human-computer interaction, yet they often lack emotional intelligence, leading to frustration and disengagement. This paper presents 'EmpaChat', a novel framework that integrates emotional intelligence into conversational systems. EmpaChat leverages multimodal affect recognition and empathetic response generation to create a more human-like interaction experience. Our user study with 120 participants shows that EmpaChat significantly improves user satisfaction, perceived empathy, and task completion rates compared to traditional conversational interfaces.
