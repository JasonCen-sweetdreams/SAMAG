Traditional query expansion techniques often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability, hindering their adoption in modern search engines. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE', which leverages a hierarchical ontology to efficiently expand queries and retrieve relevant documents. HQE reduces the dimensionality of the query space by aggregating semantically related terms, enabling fast and accurate document retrieval. Experiments on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and query processing time.
