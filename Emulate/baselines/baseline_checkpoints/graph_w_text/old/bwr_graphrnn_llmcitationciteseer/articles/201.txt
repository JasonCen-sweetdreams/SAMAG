Time series forecasting has numerous applications, but the lack of interpretability in current state-of-the-art models hinders their adoption in high-stakes domains. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that leverages both local and global patterns to generate predictions. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on relevant time segments and features, providing insights into the forecasting process. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for its predictions.
