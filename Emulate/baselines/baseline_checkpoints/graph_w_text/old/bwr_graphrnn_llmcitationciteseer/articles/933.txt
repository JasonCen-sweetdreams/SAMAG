Optimizing query execution plans is critical for efficient data retrieval in modern database systems. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize query plans for multi-dimensional data. Our method, dubbed 'QLearn', uses a DRL agent to explore the vast space of possible query plans and learn an optimal policy from experience. We evaluate QLearn on a suite of benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques. Furthermore, we show that QLearn can generalize to new, unseen query workloads, making it a promising solution for real-world database systems.
