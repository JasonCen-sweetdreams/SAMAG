Recommendation systems (RS) have become ubiquitous in modern online services. However, their lack of transparency and explainability hinders user trust and understanding. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework for explainable RS. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex item relationships and user preferences, while incorporating hierarchical graph pooling to provide interpretable explanations. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating HGAT's superior performance and increased explainability compared to state-of-the-art RS models.
