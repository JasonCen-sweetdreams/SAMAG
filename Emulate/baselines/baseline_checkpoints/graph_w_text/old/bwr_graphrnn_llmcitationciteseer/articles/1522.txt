This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) framework for scalable multi-agent path planning in complex environments. Our approach represents the environment as a hierarchical graph, where agents are modeled as nodes and edges capture spatial relationships. We learn a hierarchical representation of the graph using a nested graph neural network, which enables efficient computation of agent paths while respecting spatial constraints. Experimental results on a large-scale traffic simulation dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of path planning efficiency and scalability, making it suitable for real-world applications.
