Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various information retrieval tasks, but they often suffer from the cold start problem and limited domain knowledge. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to improve the performance of neural retrieval models. Our method, called NEQE, generates high-quality expansion terms by analyzing the relevance signals from a small set of pseudo-relevant documents. We evaluate NEQE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, especially for rare queries and under-resourced domains. Our analysis also reveals that NEQE can be easily integrated with existing neural retrieval models, making it a promising solution for real-world information retrieval applications.
