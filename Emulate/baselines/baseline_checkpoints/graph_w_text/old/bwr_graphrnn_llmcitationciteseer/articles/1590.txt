Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have become increasingly prevalent in human-computer interaction. However, existing ECAs often struggle to elicit emotional feedback from users, limiting their ability to provide empathetic responses. This paper presents an ECA framework that incorporates nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions and body language, to encourage users to share their emotional experiences. We conducted a user study with 100 participants and found that our ECA, 'Empa', outperformed a text-based interface in terms of emotional disclosure and user satisfaction. The results have implications for the design of ECAs in various applications, including mental health support and customer service.
