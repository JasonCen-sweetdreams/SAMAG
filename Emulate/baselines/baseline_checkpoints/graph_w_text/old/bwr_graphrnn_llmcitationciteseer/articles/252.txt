Ad-hoc search in large-scale distributed document collections poses significant challenges due to the need for efficient indexing, retrieval, and ranking. This paper proposes a novel neural retrieval model, 'DistributedRetriever', which integrates a hierarchical attention mechanism with a distributed search framework. By learning to represent documents and queries in a shared latent space, our model enables fast and accurate search results. Experimental evaluations on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DistributedRetriever outperforms traditional keyword-based search methods while reducing computational overhead by up to 40%.
