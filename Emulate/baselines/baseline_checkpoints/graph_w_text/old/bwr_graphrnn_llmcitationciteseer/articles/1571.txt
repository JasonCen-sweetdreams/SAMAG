Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights. Our HAN model consists of a feature attention module that weights relevant features and a temporal attention module that captures long-term dependencies. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and anomaly explanation quality.
