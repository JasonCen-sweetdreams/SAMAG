Cloud-native database systems have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper explores the application of learned index structures to accelerate query processing in cloud-native databases. We propose a novel framework, 'QLIS', which leverages machine learning models to predict query patterns and optimize index creation. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that QLIS achieves up to 3x faster query execution times compared to traditional indexing techniques.
