Autonomous surveillance systems relying on multiple agents face the challenge of efficient exploration in heterogeneous environments. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated multi-agent exploration, leveraging graph-based models to represent agent interactions and environment heterogeneity. Our algorithm, 'CoEx', integrates decentralized decision-making with online learning to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results demonstrate improved exploration efficiency and robustness to agent failures in simulated warehouse and airport scenarios.
