Short-text retrieval is a challenging task due to the limited context and ambiguity of user queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'ContextEmb', which leverages context-aware embeddings to disambiguate query terms and capture semantic relationships. We utilize a graph-based attention mechanism to weigh the importance of each term in the query and its context, and integrate this information into a neural ranking model. Experimental results on several short-text collections demonstrate that ContextEmb significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of precision and nDCG.
