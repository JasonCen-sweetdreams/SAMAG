The proliferation of big data has led to a surge in demand for efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', designed specifically for column-store databases. ColOpt leverages statistical models to predict query performance and dynamically adjusts the storage layout to minimize I/O overhead. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world big data analytics workload demonstrates that ColOpt achieves an average query performance improvement of 3.2x compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
