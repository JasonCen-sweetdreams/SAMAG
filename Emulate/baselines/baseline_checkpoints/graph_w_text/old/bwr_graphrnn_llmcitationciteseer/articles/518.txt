Virtual reality (VR) experiences are increasingly being used in various domains, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the concept of emotional feedback loops, which involve real-time affective state recognition, personalized feedback, and adaptive system responses. We present a novel framework, 'EmoLoop', that leverages machine learning-based emotion detection, sentiment analysis, and cognitive modeling to create a more immersive and engaging VR experience. A user study involving 30 participants demonstrates that EmoLoop significantly enhances user satisfaction, emotional resonance, and overall system usability.
