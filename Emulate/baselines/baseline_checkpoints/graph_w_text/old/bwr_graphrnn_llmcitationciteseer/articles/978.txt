Distributed database systems face significant performance challenges due to complex query optimization. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RL-QO', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and use deep Q-networks to learn an optimal policy. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that RL-QO outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while also adapting to changing workload patterns.
