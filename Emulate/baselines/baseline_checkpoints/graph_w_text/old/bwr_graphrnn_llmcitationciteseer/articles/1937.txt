Column-oriented databases have become increasingly popular for analytical workloads, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive join ordering, which dynamically adjusts the join order based on real-time statistics and query execution feedback. Our proposed algorithm, 'AJOp', incorporates a machine learning-based cost model and a genetic algorithm to search for the optimal join order. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AJOp outperforms state-of-the-art join ordering techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
