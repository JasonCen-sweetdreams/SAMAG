As the global population ages, there is a growing need for conversational interfaces that are accessible and usable by older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a novel design framework for creating inclusive conversational systems that accommodate the unique needs and abilities of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments, which informed the development of a set of design principles and guidelines for creating supportive conversational interfaces. Our results show that the proposed framework can significantly improve the usability and accessibility of conversational systems for this population, leading to increased user satisfaction and reduced cognitive load.
