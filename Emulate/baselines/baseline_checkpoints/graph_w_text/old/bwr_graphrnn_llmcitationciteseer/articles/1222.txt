Specialized search engines, catering to specific domains or user groups, face unique challenges in query processing and retrieval. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach to query reformulation, 'DeepQR', which leverages contextualized embeddings and reinforcement learning to generate semantically equivalent queries. Our experiments on three diverse datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, particularly for complex, multi-faceted queries. DeepQR is shown to outperform state-of-the-art query expansion and reformulation techniques, offering a promising solution for specialized search engines.
