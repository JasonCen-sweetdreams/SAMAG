This paper proposes a novel approach to task allocation for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and develop a scalable algorithm that leverages graph neural networks to learn effective coordination strategies. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency. We also provide insights into the learned coordination policies and their implications for real-world multi-agent systems.
