Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized various aspects of human-computer interaction, but existing interfaces often neglect the nuances of human gaze behavior. This paper presents 'GazeAdapt', a novel eye-gaze based adaptive interface that dynamically adjusts VR content and interaction modalities based on real-time user attention. Our approach leverages a deep learning model to predict user intent from gaze patterns, and a probabilistic framework to optimize interface adaptations. User studies demonstrate significant improvements in user experience, reduced cognitive load, and enhanced task performance in VR environments.
