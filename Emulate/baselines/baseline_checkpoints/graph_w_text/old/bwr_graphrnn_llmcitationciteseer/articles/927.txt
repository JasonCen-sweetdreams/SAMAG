Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and climate science. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their lack of interpretability hinders trust and adoption. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant time-series segments. We demonstrate that HAN improves forecasting accuracy and provides transparent, feature-level explanations of its predictions. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that HAN outperforms existing models and offers insights into the underlying time-series patterns.
