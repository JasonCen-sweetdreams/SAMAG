In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, which leverages distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to minimize communication overhead and maximize system performance. Our approach, called 'AgentDCOP', uses a novel combination of local search and constraint propagation to solve the task allocation problem in a distributed manner. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate that AgentDCOP outperforms centralized optimization methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
