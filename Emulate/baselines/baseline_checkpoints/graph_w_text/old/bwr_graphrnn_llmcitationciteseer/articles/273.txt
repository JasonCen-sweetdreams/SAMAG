In multi-agent systems, decision-making often involves complex interactions and trade-offs. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in such systems. Our approach learns to focus on relevant agents, interactions, and features, generating attention weights that provide insight into the decision-making process. We evaluate our method on a simulated traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved decision quality and interpretability compared to baseline methods. The proposed HAN architecture has significant implications for real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles and smart cities.
