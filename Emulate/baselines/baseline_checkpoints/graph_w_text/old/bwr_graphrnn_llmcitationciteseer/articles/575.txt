In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach, called Decentralized Task Allocation with Reinforcement Learning (DTARL), enables agents to learn to allocate tasks in a distributed manner without relying on a centralized controller. We employ a novel reward function that encourages agents to explore and exploit the task space, and demonstrate the effectiveness of DTARL in a simulated environment with varying numbers of agents and tasks. Experimental results show that DTARL outperforms traditional centralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
