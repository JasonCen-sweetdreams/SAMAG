Distributed databases are increasingly used to store and manage large amounts of data, but efficient query processing remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'D-MIND', for multi-dimensional range queries in distributed databases. D-MIND leverages a hierarchical indexing structure that adapts to the data distribution and query patterns, reducing the number of nodes involved in query processing. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that D-MIND outperforms existing indexing techniques, achieving an average speedup of 3.5x for range queries while maintaining a comparable storage overhead.
