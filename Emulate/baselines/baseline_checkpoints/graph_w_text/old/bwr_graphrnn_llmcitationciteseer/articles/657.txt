Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in node classification tasks. However, most existing GNNs are limited to single-label classification and fail to capture complex relationships between labels. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for multi-label node classification. HGAT leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant labels and their correlations, enabling the model to capture label dependencies and improve classification accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in multi-label node classification tasks.
