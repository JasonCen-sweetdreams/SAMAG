This paper presents a decentralized agent coordination framework for urban traffic management, using reinforcement learning to optimize traffic signal control. Our approach, called 'DecentraLight', utilizes a multi-agent system where each agent, representing an intersection, learns to adapt its signal timing to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DecentraLight in a simulated environment, showing significant improvements in traffic flow and reduction in travel times compared to traditional, centralized traffic management systems.
