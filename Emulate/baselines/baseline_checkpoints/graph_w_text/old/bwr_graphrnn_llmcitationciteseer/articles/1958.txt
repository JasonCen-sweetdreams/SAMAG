Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks. However, they often struggle with multi-label classification problems, where each node can belong to multiple classes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that addresses this limitation. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant node neighborhoods and capture complex label dependencies. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms existing GNN-based methods by a significant margin, achieving higher F1-scores and AUC-ROC values.
