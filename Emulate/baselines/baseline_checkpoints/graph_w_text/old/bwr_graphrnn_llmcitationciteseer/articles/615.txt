In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn agent-agent and agent-task relationships. Our approach, dubbed 'GNN-Allocator', enables agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner, without relying on a centralized controller. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-Allocator in simulated disaster response scenarios, where it outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
