With the exponential growth of digital data, efficient document indexing is crucial for scalable information retrieval systems. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'Hierarchical Bloom Filter' (HBF), which leverages hierarchical clustering and probabilistic filtering to reduce index size and query latency. Our experiments on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HBF outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving an average query speedup of 3.2x and a 40% reduction in index size, while maintaining retrieval accuracy.
