Optimizing query execution in distributed database systems is crucial for high-performance data processing. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans. We introduce a reward function that balances query latency and resource utilization, and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query optimization strategy. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional cost-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
