Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. We model the query optimization problem as a graph optimization problem, where the graph represents the query plan and the GNN learns to predict the optimal execution plan. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
