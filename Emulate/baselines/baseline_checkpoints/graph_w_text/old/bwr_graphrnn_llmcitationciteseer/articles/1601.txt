Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph structures and the need to balance query performance with resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using meta-learning, which leverages learned patterns from historical queries to optimize new, unseen queries. Our approach, dubbed 'GraphMeta', uses a neural network-based meta-learner to predict optimal query plans and reduces query latency by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques on a real-world graph dataset.
