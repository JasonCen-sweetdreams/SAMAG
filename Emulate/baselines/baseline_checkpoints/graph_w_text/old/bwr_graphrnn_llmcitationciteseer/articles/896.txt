Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in data integration, yet existing solutions often suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages graph-based clustering and hierarchical indexing to efficiently disambiguate entities. Our method, called GraphDis, constructs a hierarchical graph representation of the data and employs a clustering algorithm to group similar entities together. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphDis on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
