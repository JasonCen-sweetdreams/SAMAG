Distributed database systems (DDBS) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally. However, query optimization in DDBS remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, called QOPT-RL, learns to optimize queries by interacting with the DDBS environment and receiving rewards based on query execution time. We evaluate QOPT-RL on a real-world DDBS benchmark and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
