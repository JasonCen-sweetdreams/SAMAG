Object detection is a crucial task in autonomous vehicles, requiring real-time processing and high accuracy. This paper proposes a novel attention-based convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, dubbed 'EagleEye', which achieves state-of-the-art object detection performance while reducing computational overhead by 30%. EagleEye incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism that focuses on relevant regions of the input image, allowing for efficient feature extraction and detection. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate EagleEye's capability to detect objects in real-time, outperforming existing CNN-based detectors in terms of speed and accuracy.
