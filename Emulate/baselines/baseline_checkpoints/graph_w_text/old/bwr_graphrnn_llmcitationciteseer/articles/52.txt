This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the agent interaction graph and task dependencies using a hierarchical GNN architecture, which learns to predict task assignments that minimize global cost and maximize system efficiency. Our method, called GNN-TA, is evaluated on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in task allocation quality and robustness compared to traditional distributed optimization methods.
