This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the role of gesture-based interaction in shaping user experience. We designed a VR system that uses machine learning-based gesture recognition to facilitate intuitive object manipulation. Our user study reveals that embodied cognition principles can significantly enhance user engagement, spatial awareness, and task performance in VR. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems and highlight the potential of gesture-based interaction for enhancing cognitive processing in immersive environments.
