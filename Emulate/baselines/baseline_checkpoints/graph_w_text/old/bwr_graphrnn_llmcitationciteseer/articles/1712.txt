Search engines often struggle to provide diverse search results, leading to a lack of novelty and relevance for users. This paper proposes a context-aware query expansion (CAQE) approach that incorporates user context, query semantics, and result clustering to improve search result diversity. Our approach leverages a graph-based representation of the query and its related entities to identify relevant expansion terms. We evaluate CAQE on a large-scale search log dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in search result diversity and user satisfaction compared to traditional query expansion methods.
