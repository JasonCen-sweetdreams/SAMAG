Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used to manage large-scale data across multiple nodes. However, data replication and query optimization remain significant challenges in DDS. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RepOpt', which combines a dynamic replication strategy with a query optimization framework. RepOpt adapts to changing data access patterns and node availability, minimizing data redundancy while ensuring query throughput. Our experimental evaluation on a realistic dataset demonstrates that RepOpt outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in terms of query response time and data freshness.
