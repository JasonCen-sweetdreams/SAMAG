Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important in various applications, such as financial analytics and IoT sensor processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the massive data volumes and complex query patterns involved. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, called GBI-Opt, which leverages the structural properties of data warehousing queries to optimize query execution plans. Our approach reduces the query optimization time by up to 50% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while achieving similar query performance. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of GBI-Opt in supporting real-time data warehousing applications.
