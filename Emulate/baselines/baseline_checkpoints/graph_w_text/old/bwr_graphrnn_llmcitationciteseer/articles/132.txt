Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time. We also demonstrate the scalability of our approach by evaluating its performance on large-scale queries.
