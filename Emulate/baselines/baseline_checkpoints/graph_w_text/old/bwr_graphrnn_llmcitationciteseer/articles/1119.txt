The proliferation of cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms has led to a significant increase in multi-tenancy, where multiple clients share the same database instance. However, this sharing can result in performance degradation and increased latency due to resource contention. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MultiTenOpt', which leverages machine learning-based workload characterization and predictive modeling to optimize query execution and resource allocation in multi-tenant DBaaS environments. Our experiments on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization.
