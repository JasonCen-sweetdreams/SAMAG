Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide transparency into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that incorporates both item-level and user-level interactions to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between users, items, and attributes, and a hierarchical framework to capture multi-level dependencies. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
