Dynamic graphs, where nodes and edges change over time, are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Node classification in such graphs is challenging due to the lack of fixed graph structures. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges at multiple scales. HGAT consists of node-level attention, edge-level attention, and a hierarchical fusion module. Our experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks, even when the graph structure changes significantly over time.
