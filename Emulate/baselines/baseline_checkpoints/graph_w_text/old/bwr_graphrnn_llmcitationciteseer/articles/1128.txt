Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval (IR) that involves retrieving relevant documents for a given query. One of the key challenges in ad-hoc retrieval is the vocabulary mismatch problem, where the query terms do not match the terms in the relevant documents. Query expansion is a popular technique used to address this problem. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that utilizes neural embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between words. Our approach learns a dense vector representation of words and uses these representations to expand the query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods and achieves state-of-the-art results in ad-hoc retrieval.
