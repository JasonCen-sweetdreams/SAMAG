Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis, but traditional algorithms struggle with high-dimensional data. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepHier', which leverages deep neural networks to learn a hierarchical representation of the data. Our method combines a stacked denoising autoencoder with a hierarchical clustering objective, allowing it to scale to large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepHier on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in clustering quality and speed compared to state-of-the-art methods.
