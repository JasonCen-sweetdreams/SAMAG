Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective passage retrieval to identify relevant information from a massive corpus. We propose a neural passage retrieval model that incorporates hierarchical document encoding, allowing it to capture both local and global semantic structures. Our approach leverages a novel document-aware attention mechanism and a passage reranking strategy based on semantic similarity. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate significant improvements in passage retrieval accuracy and end-to-end ODQA performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
