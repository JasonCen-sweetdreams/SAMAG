In this paper, we propose a novel approach for cooperative task allocation in multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our method, called GraphTask, leverages the expressive power of GNNs to model complex interactions between agents and tasks, and optimizes task allocation to maximize overall system performance. We evaluate GraphTask on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantees on the optimality of our approach under certain conditions.
