Effective information retrieval in medical domains requires capturing nuanced relationships between clinical concepts. This paper proposes a novel approach to context-aware query expansion, leveraging graph-based semantic embeddings to incorporate medical domain knowledge. Our method, MedQuery, represents medical concepts as nodes in a knowledge graph and uses graph convolutional networks to learn contextualized embeddings. These embeddings are then used to expand user queries, improving retrieval performance on a benchmark medical document collection. Experimental results show that MedQuery outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% increase in precision at top-10 retrieved documents.
