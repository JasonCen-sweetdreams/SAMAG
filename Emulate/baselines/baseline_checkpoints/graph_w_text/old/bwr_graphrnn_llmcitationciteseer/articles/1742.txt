Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop inclusive VR interfaces that cater to the needs of visually impaired individuals. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops and usability studies to identify key challenges and design recommendations. Our proposed interface, 'VR-EASE', incorporates audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized visualization options, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction.
