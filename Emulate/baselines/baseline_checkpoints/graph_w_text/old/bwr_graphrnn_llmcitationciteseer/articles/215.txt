Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to reduce the number of documents that need to be processed. We propose a novel approach, 'HierDoc', which utilizes hierarchical document embeddings to capture the semantic structure of documents. Our method represents each document as a hierarchical composition of sentence and paragraph embeddings, enabling the model to focus on relevant sections of the document. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HierDoc achieves a 25% improvement in passage retrieval accuracy and a 30% reduction in computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods.
