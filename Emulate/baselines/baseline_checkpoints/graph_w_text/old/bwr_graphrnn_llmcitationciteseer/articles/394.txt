Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants for this population. We conducted participatory design workshops with 20 older adults to identify their needs and preferences. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and simple voice prompts, personalized vocabulary, and multimodal feedback. We developed a prototype, 'ElderVoice', which incorporates these design principles. A usability study with 15 older adults shows that ElderVoice significantly improves their interaction experience and reduces frustration. Our work contributes to the development of more accessible and inclusive voice assistants.
