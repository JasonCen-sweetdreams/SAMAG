Multi-agent systems (MAS) often require negotiation protocols to resolve conflicts and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. This paper proposes a novel hybrid negotiation strategy, 'HyNeS', that combines game-theoretic and machine learning approaches to adapt to dynamic environments. HyNeS exploits the strengths of both methods to improve negotiation outcomes, leveraging opponent modeling and adaptive concession tactics. Experimental results demonstrate that HyNeS outperforms existing negotiation strategies in scenarios with incomplete information and uncertain opponent behavior.
