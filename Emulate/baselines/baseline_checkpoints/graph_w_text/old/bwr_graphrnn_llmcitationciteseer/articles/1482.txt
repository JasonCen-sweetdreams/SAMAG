In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and allocate tasks dynamically. Our approach, called 'GraphTask', learns to predict task assignments based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. Experiments on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that GraphTask outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of system performance, scalability, and robustness to agent failures.
