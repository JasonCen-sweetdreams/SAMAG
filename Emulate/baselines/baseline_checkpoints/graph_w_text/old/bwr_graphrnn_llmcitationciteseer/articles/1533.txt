Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn and interact with complex spatial information. This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in VR, focusing on the impact of gestures on spatial reasoning tasks. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, who were tasked with solving 3D puzzles in a VR environment. Our results show that participants who used gestures to manipulate virtual objects outperformed those who used controller-based input, and that gesture-based interaction reduced cognitive load. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of immersive learning experiences.
