Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval (IR) due to the complexity of user queries and document representations. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based approach to query expansion, which learns to select the most informative terms to augment the original query. Our method, 'RL-QE', utilizes a novel reward function that balances the trade-off between query drift and retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG).
