As robots become increasingly integrated into human-centric environments, understanding the factors that influence human-robot collaboration is crucial. This paper explores the impact of embodiment on human-robot collaboration using virtual reality (VR). We designed an experiment where human participants collaborated with a robot in a VR environment, with varying levels of embodiment. Our results show that increased embodiment leads to improved trust, communication, and task performance. We also identify key aspects of embodiment that contribute to these benefits, including anthropomorphism and spatial awareness. Our findings have important implications for the design of future human-robot collaboration systems.
