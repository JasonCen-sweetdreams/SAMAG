Human pose estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in robotics, healthcare, and surveillance. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages transfer learning and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to achieve real-time performance on resource-constrained devices. We design a hierarchical GCN architecture that incorporates pose-aware graph attention and demonstrate its effectiveness on multiple benchmark datasets. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and inference speed, making it suitable for real-world applications.
