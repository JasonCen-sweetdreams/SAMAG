Time-series forecasting is a ubiquitous task in many domains, but existing models often struggle with complex, multi-scale patterns. We propose a novel transfer learning framework, 'MultiResT', that leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to adapt to diverse time-series datasets. By integrating multi-resolution representations, our approach captures both local and global patterns, resulting in improved forecasting performance and robustness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of MultiResT, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 15% in mean absolute error.
