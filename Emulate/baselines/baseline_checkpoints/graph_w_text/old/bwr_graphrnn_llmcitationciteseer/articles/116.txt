Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR), particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroExp', which leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. We propose a two-stage framework that first generates a set of candidate expansion terms using a language model, and then refines the selection through a neural ranking model. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExp outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
