Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular in modern data management systems. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and network topology. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to select the optimal query plan by interacting with the database environment. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimizers in terms of execution time and resource utilization. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of our algorithm.
