In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that involves assigning tasks to agents to maximize system efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn task allocation policies. Our approach consists of a high-level task allocator that assigns tasks to agent clusters and a low-level allocator that assigns tasks to individual agents within each cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations on a variety of task allocation scenarios, showcasing significant improvements in system efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional allocation methods.
