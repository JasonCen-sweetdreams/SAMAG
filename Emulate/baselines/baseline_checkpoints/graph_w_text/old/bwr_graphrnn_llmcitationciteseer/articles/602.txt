Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on static heuristics, which may not adapt well to dynamic workloads and varying system conditions. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query execution times. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our RL-based approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of average query response time.
