Distributed database systems are increasingly used to manage large-scale data repositories, but query response time remains a major performance bottleneck. This paper proposes an adaptive caching framework, ACaDe, that dynamically adjusts cache allocation based on query patterns and data distribution. Our approach leverages a novel caching metric, 'query similarity entropy', to identify optimal cache sizes and minimize query latency. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ACaDe outperforms state-of-the-art caching strategies by up to 35% in query response time, while maintaining cache efficiency.
