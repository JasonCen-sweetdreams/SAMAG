Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, have become increasingly prevalent, but people with disabilities often face significant barriers in interacting with these systems. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive conversational interfaces. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with individuals with disabilities and identified key challenges and requirements for accessible conversational interfaces. Our proposed design framework integrates multiple modalities, including speech, text, and gestures, to provide flexible and adaptive interaction paths. We evaluated our approach through a usability study with 20 participants with disabilities and report significant improvements in user experience and accessibility.
