This paper proposes a novel query-driven document ranking framework that leverages neural re-ranking and diverse retrieval techniques. Our approach, called DDRank, first retrieves an initial set of documents using a traditional retrieval method, and then applies a neural re-ranking model to re-score the documents based on their relevance to the query. To promote diversity in the top-ranked documents, we incorporate a maximum marginal relevance (MMR) criterion into the re-ranking process. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that DDRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of both relevance and diversity metrics.
