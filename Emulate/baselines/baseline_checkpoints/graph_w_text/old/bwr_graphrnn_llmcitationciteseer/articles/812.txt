Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, but most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for explainable time-series anomaly detection. HAN leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant time-series segments and features, providing insights into anomaly generation. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy while providing interpretable results, enabling domain experts to take corrective actions.
