Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing technique that dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distributions. Our approach leverages machine learning models to predict query hotspots and optimize index creation, resulting in significant improvements in query response times. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 30%.
