This study investigates the effects of personalized avatars on user engagement in Virtual Reality (VR) interfaces. We designed an experiment with 120 participants, using a combination of gaze tracking, physiological signals, and self-reported measures to assess user experience. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and overall engagement, compared to those with generic avatars. We also found that avatar personalization had a significant impact on social presence and perceived trustworthiness of the virtual environment. These findings have implications for the design of VR interfaces in various domains, including education, gaming, and healthcare.
