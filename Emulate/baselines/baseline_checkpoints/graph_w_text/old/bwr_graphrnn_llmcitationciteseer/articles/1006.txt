Domain-specific information retrieval often relies on tailored query expansion techniques to bridge the vocabulary gap between users and relevant documents. This paper introduces 'NeuroQE', a neural network-based approach that learns to expand queries by capturing domain-specific semantic relationships. NeuroQE leverages a multi-task learning framework, jointly optimizing query expansion and relevance ranking. Experimental results on three specialized domains (biomedicine, law, and computer science) demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and robustness.
