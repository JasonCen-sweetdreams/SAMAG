As cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms become increasingly popular, optimizing query performance for multiple tenants sharing the same infrastructure is crucial. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'TenantAware', which leverages machine learning-based predictive modeling to dynamically adjust query execution plans based on real-time tenant workload patterns. Our experiments on a large-scale DBaaS platform demonstrate that TenantAware reduces average query latency by up to 30% and improves overall system throughput by 25%, while ensuring fairness and isolation among tenants.
