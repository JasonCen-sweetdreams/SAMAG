Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to an ambiguous mention in a query. Existing approaches rely heavily on manual feature engineering and predefined knowledge bases. This paper proposes a novel query-driven entity disambiguation framework, 'QDE-GAT', which leverages graph attention networks to model the complex relationships between entities and their contexts. Our approach can effectively capture both local and global dependencies, and adapt to diverse query formats and entity types. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of QDE-GAT over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, robustness, and scalability.
