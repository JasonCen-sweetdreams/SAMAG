Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR) due to the vocabulary mismatch problem. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, NeuroQE, which leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weighs the importance of expansion terms based on their contextualized representations. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
