Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant texts that contain the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense representation (HDR) method that captures both local and global semantic relationships between questions and passages. HDR uses a stacked transformer architecture to learn dense representations of passages at multiple granularities, enabling efficient filtering and ranking of candidate passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions benchmark demonstrate that HDR outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval models, achieving a 15% increase in top-20 passage accuracy while reducing computational cost by 30%.
