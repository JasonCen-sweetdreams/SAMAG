Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it helps to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach to query expansion, which leverages the semantic relationships between words to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our model, called DeepQE, uses a combination of word embeddings and a recurrent neural network to learn a robust representation of the query context. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
