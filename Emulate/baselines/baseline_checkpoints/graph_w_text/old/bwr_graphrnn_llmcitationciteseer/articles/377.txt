Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraphIndex', which leverages the structural properties of database graphs to accelerate query execution. We introduce a probabilistic indexing scheme that adaptively selects the most informative indices based on query patterns and data distributions. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphIndex achieves an average speedup of 3.2x over state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
