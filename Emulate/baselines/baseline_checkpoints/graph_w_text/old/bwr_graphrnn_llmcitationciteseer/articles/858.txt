Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in e-commerce and online services, but their opacity hinders trust and understanding. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that incorporates explainability into the recommendation process. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant user-item interactions and generates interpretable explanations for recommended items. We evaluate HGAT on three benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
