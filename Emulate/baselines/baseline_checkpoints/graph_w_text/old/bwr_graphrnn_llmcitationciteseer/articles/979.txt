Real-time object detection is a crucial task in autonomous vehicles, but existing neural architectures often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper presents a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method, 'RealNAS', which leverages a differentiable search space and a novel latency-aware reward function to optimize detection models for real-time performance. We demonstrate that RealNAS discovers architectures that achieve state-of-the-art detection accuracy on the KITTI dataset while reducing inference latency by up to 30% compared to manually designed models.
