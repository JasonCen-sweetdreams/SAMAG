Public displays are increasingly prevalent in urban spaces, but their security remains a concern. We propose EyeGazeAuth, a novel gaze-based authentication system that leverages deep learning to identify users based on their eye movement patterns. Our approach uses a convolutional neural network to analyze gaze data captured from a low-cost, off-the-shelf eye tracker and achieves an accuracy of 95.6% in a controlled experiment with 50 participants. EyeGazeAuth offers a convenient, non-intrusive, and robust authentication method for public displays, enabling secure access to personalized services and information.
