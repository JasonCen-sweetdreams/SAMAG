In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires coordinating agents to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to learn cooperative policies for task allocation. Our method, called 'CATS', uses graph neural networks to represent agent interactions and a decentralized actor-critic framework to learn coordinated actions. We evaluate CATS on a simulated manufacturing scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and resource utilization compared to traditional heuristics and centralized planning methods.
