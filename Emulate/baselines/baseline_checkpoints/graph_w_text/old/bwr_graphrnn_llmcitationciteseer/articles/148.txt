Dense passage retrieval has recently shown promising results in open-domain question answering tasks. However, existing methods suffer from high computational costs and memory requirements. This paper proposes an efficient dense passage retrieval framework, 'DPR- Lite', which leverages a novel combination of sparse and dense retrieval techniques. Our approach reduces the computational complexity of dense retrieval by an order of magnitude while maintaining comparable performance to state-of-the-art models. We evaluate DPR-Lite on several open-domain question answering benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.
