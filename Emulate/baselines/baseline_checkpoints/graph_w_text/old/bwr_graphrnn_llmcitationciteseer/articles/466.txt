Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of each modality to recognize emotions more accurately. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention mechanisms that learn to focus on salient features, followed by a hierarchical fusion module that integrates the outputs from each modality. Experiments on the IEMOCAP and SEMAINE datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal data, achieving an average F1-score of 0.83.
