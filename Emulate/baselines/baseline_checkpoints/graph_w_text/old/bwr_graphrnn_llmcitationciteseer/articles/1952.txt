Time-series data is increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can have severe consequences in critical applications such as healthcare and finance. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect adversarial attacks on time-series data using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the time-series data as a graph, where each node represents a time step, and edges capture temporal dependencies. Our GNN-based detector, 'GraphGuard', learns to identify anomalies in the graph structure induced by adversarial attacks. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphGuard outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.
