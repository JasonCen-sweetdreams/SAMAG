Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the query and document graphs as heterogeneous graphs and leverage GNNs to learn the semantic relationships between query terms and document keywords. Our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as Rocchio and KL-divergence, on several benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the retrieval performance of IR systems.
