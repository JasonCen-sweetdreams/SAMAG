Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component of modern search engines, as it helps disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a novel hybrid QE model, 'HybQE', which combines the strengths of both lexical and semantic expansion techniques. Our approach leverages a graph-based method to identify meaningful query term relationships and incorporates a neural network-based ranking model to optimize the expanded query. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that HybQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and query processing efficiency.
