Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used in modern data centers, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select the most efficient query plan based on the underlying system workload, data distribution, and resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world DDS testbed demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
