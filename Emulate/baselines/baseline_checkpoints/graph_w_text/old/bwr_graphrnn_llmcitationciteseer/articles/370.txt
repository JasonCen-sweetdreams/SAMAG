In modern information retrieval (IR) systems, ranking models play a crucial role in retrieving relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HierRank, which leverages the strengths of both neural networks and traditional IR methods. HierRank adopts a hierarchical architecture, consisting of a document-level and a passage-level neural ranking module, to capture both coarse-grained and fine-grained relevance signals. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
