High-dimensional data clustering is a fundamental problem in machine learning, but traditional methods like k-means and hierarchical clustering struggle with scalability and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'Hierarchical Neural Clustering' (HNC), which leverages deep neural networks to learn a hierarchical representation of the data. HNC uses a stacked autoencoder to reduce dimensionality, followed by a clustering layer that learns a hierarchical structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HNC on several benchmark datasets, achieving improved clustering quality and scalability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
