Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper investigates the impact of cognitive load on speech patterns in older adults interacting with voice assistants. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, analyzing speech characteristics and cognitive load metrics. Our results show that older adults exhibit higher cognitive load when interacting with voice assistants, leading to increased speech disfluencies and errors. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants, incorporating adaptive cognitive load management and personalized speech recognition models. Our findings have significant implications for the development of accessible and usable voice-based interfaces for older adults.
