Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query representations. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages neural semantic graphs to reinforce query expansion. By modeling relationships between query terms and their semantic neighbors, NeuroQE generates more informative and diverse query representations. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques. We also provide insights into the interpretability of our approach, showcasing the benefits of incorporating semantic knowledge graphs into retrieval systems.
