Time series anomaly detection is a critical task in various applications, including healthcare, finance, and IoT. While deep learning models have achieved impressive results, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time series anomaly detection. Our HAN model consists of a hierarchical encoder that captures complex patterns at multiple scales, and an attention mechanism that highlights relevant segments contributing to the anomaly score. We evaluate our approach on three real-world datasets, demonstrating improved detection performance and providing visual explanations for the identified anomalies.
