This paper presents a novel gesture recognition system designed specifically for older adults with dementia. Our approach leverages a machine learning-based framework that adapts to individual users' cognitive and motor abilities, enabling personalized gesture recognition. We conducted a user study with 20 older adults with dementia and found that our system achieves an average recognition accuracy of 92.5%, outperforming existing gesture recognition systems. We also explored the impact of cognitive load on gesture recognition and provide design recommendations for developing more inclusive and accessible HCI systems for older adults with dementia.
