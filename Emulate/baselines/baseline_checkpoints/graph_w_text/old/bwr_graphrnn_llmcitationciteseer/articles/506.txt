Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to select optimal query plans based on a reward function that balances query execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
