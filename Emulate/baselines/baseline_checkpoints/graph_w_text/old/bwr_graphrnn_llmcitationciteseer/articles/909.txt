This paper addresses the problem of decentralized task allocation for autonomous agents in multi-agent systems. We propose a novel approach based on distributed constraint optimization, which enables agents to make local decisions while ensuring global optimality. Our method, called DCO-TA, uses a hierarchical constraint representation and a gossip-based communication protocol to achieve efficient and scalable task allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that DCO-TA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of solution quality and communication overhead.
