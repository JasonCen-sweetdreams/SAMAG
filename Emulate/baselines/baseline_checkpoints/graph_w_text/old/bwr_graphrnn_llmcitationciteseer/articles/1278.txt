This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent coordination using hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs). We propose a scalable framework that allows agents to communicate and learn from each other in a decentralized manner, leveraging both local and global graph structures. Experimental results on a variety of multi-agent benchmark scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of coordination efficiency and adaptability to changing environments.
