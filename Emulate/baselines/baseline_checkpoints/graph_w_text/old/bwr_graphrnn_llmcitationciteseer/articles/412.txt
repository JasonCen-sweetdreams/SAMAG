Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but the role of embodiment in shaping user experience remains understudied. This paper investigates the effects of embodiment on user engagement, presence, and cognitive load in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, manipulating levels of embodiment through avatar customization and gesture recognition. Results show that increased embodiment leads to higher user engagement and presence, but also increases cognitive load. We discuss implications for VR system design and highlight avenues for future research on embodiment in HCI.
