The increasing adoption of virtual reality (VR) technology has led to a growing interest in understanding user behavior and engagement in immersive environments. This paper explores the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR, with a focus on cognitive and affective factors. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 100 participants, using a combination of surveys, interviews, and physiological measures. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user satisfaction, reduced anxiety, and improved cognitive processing. We also identify key design factors, such as avatar customization and realism, that influence user engagement. The findings have implications for the design of more effective and engaging VR experiences.
