In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages stochastic graph neural networks (SGNNs) to model the complex interactions between agents and tasks. Our approach, named 'AgentGraph', learns to represent agent and task features as node embeddings in a graph, and then performs task allocation using a probabilistic inference mechanism. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that AgentGraph outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion efficiency, robustness to agent failures, and adaptability to changing task requirements.
