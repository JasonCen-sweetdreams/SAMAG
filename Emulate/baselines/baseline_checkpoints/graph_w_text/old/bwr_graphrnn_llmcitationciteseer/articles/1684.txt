As multi-agent systems (MAS) become increasingly prevalent in real-world applications, it is crucial to develop interpretable decision-making frameworks. This paper presents Hierarchical Attention Networks for Multi-Agent Decision-Making (HAN-MAD), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively emphasize relevant information from individual agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN-MAD in improving decision-making accuracy and providing explainable insights into agent interactions. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management scenario show that HAN-MAD outperforms state-of-the-art MAS approaches while offering transparent decision-making processes.
