Mental health support systems often lack emotional resonance, leading to user disengagement. This paper presents 'EmpathyAvatar', a novel conversational interface that leverages embodied cognition to simulate empathetic responses. Our system integrates machine learning-based affect recognition, natural language processing, and computer-generated avatar animation to create a more human-like interaction experience. We evaluate EmpathyAvatar in a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in user engagement, self-disclosure, and perceived emotional support compared to traditional text-based chatbots.
