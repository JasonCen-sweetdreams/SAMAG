Domain-specific search engines face the challenge of handling ambiguous queries that require nuanced understanding of the underlying domain knowledge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages a knowledge graph to disambiguate queries and generate context-aware expansions. HQE employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively incorporate domain-specific concepts, resulting in improved retrieval efficiency and relevance. Experimental results on a biomedical search engine demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision.
