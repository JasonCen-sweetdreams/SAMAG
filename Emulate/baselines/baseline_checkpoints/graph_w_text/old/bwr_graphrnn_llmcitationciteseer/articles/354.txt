RDF graph pattern matching is a fundamental operation in semantic web query processing. As RDF datasets continue to grow, existing indexing techniques struggle to provide efficient query performance. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, called GraphPlex, which leverages a combination of graph decomposition and bitap-based indexing to accelerate RDF graph pattern matching. Experimental results on large-scale RDF benchmarks demonstrate that GraphPlex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time, while reducing index construction time by up to 5x.
