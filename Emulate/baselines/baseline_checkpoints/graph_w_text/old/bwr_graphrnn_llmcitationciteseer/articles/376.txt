Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities need to be assigned tasks to maximize overall system performance. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using deep reinforcement learning, where each agent learns to make allocation decisions based on local observations and interactions with its neighbors. We introduce a novel multi-agent Q-network architecture that incorporates graph attention mechanisms to model complex agent dependencies and task relationships. Experiments on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of solution quality, adaptability, and scalability.
