Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query planning and the high dimensionality of possible execution plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the DDS environment and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Our experimental results on a real-world DDS testbed demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
