Optimizing query execution plans in distributed database systems is a notoriously complex problem. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans based on runtime feedback. Our method, 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that balances query execution time, resource utilization, and data freshness. We evaluate RL-Opt on a real-world distributed database and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource efficiency compared to traditional optimization techniques.
