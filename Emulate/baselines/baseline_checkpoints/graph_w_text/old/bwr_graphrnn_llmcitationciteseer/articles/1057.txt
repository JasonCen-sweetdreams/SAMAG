Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to facilitate social interactions for individuals with disabilities. However, existing ECAs often lack inclusivity features, perpetuating social exclusion. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an inclusive ECA platform, 'SocialBridge', which incorporates multimodal input modalities (speech, gesture, and text) and adaptive communication strategies to accommodate diverse user needs. Our user study with 30 participants with disabilities demonstrates that SocialBridge enhances social engagement, comfort, and perceived social presence compared to traditional ECAs.
