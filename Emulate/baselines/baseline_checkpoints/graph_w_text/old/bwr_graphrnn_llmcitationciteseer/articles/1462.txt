Query expansion is a crucial component in modern information retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the semantic gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query expansion, which leverages semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and their contextual synonyms. We introduce a graph convolutional network that learns to propagate semantic features across the query graph, enabling more effective expansion of query terms. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
