This paper investigates the role of embodiment in virtual reality (VR) interfaces, focusing on the relationship between gesture recognition and user experience. We designed a novel VR system that incorporates a machine learning-based gesture recognition algorithm and conducted a user study to evaluate its impact on user immersion, presence, and overall experience. Our results show that the use of embodied gestures significantly enhances user engagement and interaction in VR environments, but also highlights the importance of balancing gesture recognition accuracy with user freedom and creativity. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems and their applications in fields such as education, healthcare, and entertainment.
