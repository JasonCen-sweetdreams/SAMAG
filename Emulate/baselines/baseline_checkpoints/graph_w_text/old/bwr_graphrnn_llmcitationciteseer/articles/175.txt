Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the inherent heterogeneity and complexity of the data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features to improve emotion recognition accuracy. Our HAN model consists of three levels of attention: modality-level, feature-level, and token-level, which enables the model to capture both local and global patterns in the data. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
