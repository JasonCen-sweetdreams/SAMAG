Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'GraphOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages graph structural properties and statistical graph summarization to prune the search space and reduce query latency. We propose a cost-based optimization approach that takes into account the distributed nature of the graph data and the underlying system architecture. Experimental results on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms existing optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
