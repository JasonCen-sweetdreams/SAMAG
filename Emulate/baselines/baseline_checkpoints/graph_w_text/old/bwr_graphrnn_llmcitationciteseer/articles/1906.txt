Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it can significantly impact the quality of search results. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, dubbed 'GraphQE', which leverages graph-based keyword embeddings to model semantic relationships between query terms. By representing queries as graphs, we enable the capture of complex contexts and improve the precision of expanded terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, with significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
