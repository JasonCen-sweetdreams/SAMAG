Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current VR interfaces often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents an exploratory study on designing accessible VR interfaces for visually impaired users. We conducted a user-centered design process, involving 15 participants with visual impairments, to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal feedback, simplified navigation, and personalized customization. We propose a set of guidelines for accessible VR interface design and demonstrate a proof-of-concept prototype, 'AccessibleVR', which incorporates these principles. Our evaluation shows that AccessibleVR significantly improves user experience and task performance for visually impaired users.
