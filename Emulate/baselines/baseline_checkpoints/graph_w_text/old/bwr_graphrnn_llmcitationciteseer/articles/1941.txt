Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans based on runtime statistics and reward functions. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
