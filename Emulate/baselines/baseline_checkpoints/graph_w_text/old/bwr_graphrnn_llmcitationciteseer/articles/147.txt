In many real-world applications, multiple agents need to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. Task allocation is a crucial step in multi-agent systems, as it significantly affects the overall system performance. This paper introduces a novel deep graph reinforcement learning framework, called DAGGER, to efficiently allocate tasks to agents in large-scale systems. DAGGER models the task allocation problem as a graph, where agents and tasks are nodes, and learns a policy to optimize the allocation using reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of DAGGER on a simulated robotic warehouse environment, achieving a 30% improvement in task completion time compared to state-of-the-art methods.
