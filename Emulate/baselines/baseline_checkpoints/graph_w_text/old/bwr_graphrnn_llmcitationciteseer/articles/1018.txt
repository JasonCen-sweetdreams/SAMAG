Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, are increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of individuals with dyslexia. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing accessible conversational interfaces, focusing on the specific challenges faced by individuals with dyslexia. We conducted a qualitative study with 20 participants and identified key design recommendations, including the use of visual cues, simplified language, and error tolerance. A prototype incorporating these recommendations was evaluated, demonstrating significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates.
