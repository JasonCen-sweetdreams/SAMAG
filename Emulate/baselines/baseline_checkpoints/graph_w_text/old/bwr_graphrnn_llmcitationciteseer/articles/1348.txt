Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in modern cloud infrastructure, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the application of machine learning techniques to improve query processing efficiency in multi-tenant environments. We propose a novel framework, 'ML-QOPT', which leverages historical query patterns and system workload data to predict optimal query execution plans. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world multi-tenant database system demonstrates that ML-QOPT achieves up to 30% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in resource utilization compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
