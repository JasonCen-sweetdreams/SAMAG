Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in various domains, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR. We designed a VR platform that generates customized avatars based on users' physical characteristics, personality traits, and preferences. Our user study with 120 participants shows that personalized avatars lead to higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and motivation, particularly among female participants. We also identify key design elements that influence user engagement, including avatar realism, customization options, and gesture recognition.
