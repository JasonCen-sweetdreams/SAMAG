This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles to virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed an experimental VR system that utilizes hand tracking and machine learning-based gesture recognition to facilitate intuitive user interaction. Our user study involving 30 participants shows that embodied cognition-informed design can significantly improve user experience, reduce cognitive load, and enhance sense of presence in VR. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of more immersive and interactive VR systems.
