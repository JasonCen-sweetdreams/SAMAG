Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process of AI-driven recommenders. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that incorporates both local and global graph structures to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to identify influential neighbors and contextualize item relationships, resulting in improved recommendation accuracy and explanation quality. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in generating transparent and trustworthy recommendations.
