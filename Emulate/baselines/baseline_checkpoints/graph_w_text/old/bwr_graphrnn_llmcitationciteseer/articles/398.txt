Multi-agent systems (MAS) have become increasingly prevalent in applications such as smart cities, autonomous vehicles, and robotics. Effective task allocation is crucial for efficient resource utilization and system performance. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach, called GraphMAS, achieves a 25% improvement in task allocation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art decentralized algorithms. We demonstrate the scalability and flexibility of GraphMAS through extensive simulations on various MAS scenarios.
