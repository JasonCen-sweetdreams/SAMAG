Immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences rely on intuitive and natural interaction methods. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction system, 'GazeVR', which leverages machine learning models to accurately predict user intent from eye-tracking data. GazeVR enables users to seamlessly interact with virtual objects, navigate through 3D environments, and engage in social interactions with virtual agents. We evaluate GazeVR in a user study, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time, accuracy, and user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based methods.
