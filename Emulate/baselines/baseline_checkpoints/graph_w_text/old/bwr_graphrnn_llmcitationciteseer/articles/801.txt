Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in DDS, as the optimal execution plan depends on various factors such as data distribution, network latency, and node availability. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-Optimizer', that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively learn the optimal execution plan for DDS queries. Our approach uses a deep Q-network (DQN) to model the query optimization problem and demonstrates improved execution times and reduced resource utilization compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world DDS cluster show that RL-Optimizer achieves up to 30% improvement in query execution times over state-of-the-art optimization methods.
