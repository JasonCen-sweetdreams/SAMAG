Cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance for multiple tenants with diverse workloads remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'TeraOpt', a novel query optimization framework designed for multi-tenant DBaaS platforms. TeraOpt leverages machine learning-based workload characterization, adaptive indexing, and concurrent query execution to minimize resource contention and improve overall system throughput. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrates that TeraOpt achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance and 2x reduction in resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
