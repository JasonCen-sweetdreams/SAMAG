Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture that leverages both user-item interactions and item-side information. HGAN learns to represent items as hierarchical graphs, enabling the model to capture complex relationships between items and their attributes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN on three real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
