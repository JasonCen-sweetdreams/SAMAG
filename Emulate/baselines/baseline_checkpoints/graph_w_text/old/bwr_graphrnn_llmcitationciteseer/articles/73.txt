Distributed relational databases have become increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query performance remains a complex challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our framework, 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal join order and indexing strategy for a given query workload. We demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers in terms of query latency and throughput, while adapting to changing workload patterns and database schema. Experiments on a distributed database cluster show that RL-Opt achieves an average speedup of 2.5x compared to the state-of-the-art optimizer.
