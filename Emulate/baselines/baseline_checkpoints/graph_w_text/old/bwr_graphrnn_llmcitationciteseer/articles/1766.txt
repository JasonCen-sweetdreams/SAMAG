Top-K retrieval is a fundamental task in many applications, including information retrieval, recommender systems, and computer vision. However, existing indexing techniques struggle to efficiently retrieve proximal neighbors in high-dimensional spaces. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'ProxiTree', which integrates proximity-aware clustering with a hierarchical tree structure. ProxiTree achieves significant query performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining a compact index size. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of ProxiTree in various top-K retrieval scenarios.
