Traditional latent semantic analysis (LSA) techniques for document retrieval suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical LSA approach, 'HLSA', which leverages a multi-level document representation to capture both local and global semantic relationships. By recursively applying LSA to document clusters, HLSA reduces the dimensionality of the term-document matrix, enabling faster and more accurate retrieval. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HLSA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval precision and query response time.
