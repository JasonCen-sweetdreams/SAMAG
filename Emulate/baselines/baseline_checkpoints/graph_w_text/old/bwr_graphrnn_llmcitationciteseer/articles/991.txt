Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, called QOpt-RL, uses an RL agent to learn an optimal query plan based on the database's current workload and system resources. We evaluate QOpt-RL on a real-world distributed database system and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
