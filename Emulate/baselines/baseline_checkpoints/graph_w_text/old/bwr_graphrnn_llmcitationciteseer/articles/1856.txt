The increasing volume of spatial data demands efficient query processing mechanisms to support various applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical grid indexing (HGI) approach to optimize query performance for massive spatial datasets. Our method partitions the data space into a hierarchical grid structure, allowing for efficient filtering and pruning of irrelevant data. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that dynamically adjusts the grid granularity based on query patterns and data distribution. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HGI outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques, achieving up to 5x improvement in query response time and 3x reduction in index size.
