Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the health and well-being of older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often pose significant accessibility barriers for this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing inclusive VR interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers, yielding a set of design principles and guidelines for accessible VR interaction. A usability study of our prototype interface demonstrates significant improvements in user engagement and task completion rates compared to existing VR systems.
