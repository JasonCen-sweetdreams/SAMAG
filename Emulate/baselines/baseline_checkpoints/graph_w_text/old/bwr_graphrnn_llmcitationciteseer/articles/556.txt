Conversational interfaces have the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing systems often fail to accommodate their unique needs and abilities. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for accessible conversational interfaces, focusing on error tolerance, simplicity, and cognitive support. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, resulting in a set of design guidelines and a prototype system that incorporates compensatory strategies for cognitive impairments. Our evaluation shows that the proposed system significantly improves user engagement and task completion rates compared to commercial conversational agents.
