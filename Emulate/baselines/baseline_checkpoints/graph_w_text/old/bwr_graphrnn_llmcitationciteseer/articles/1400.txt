Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but existing methods struggle with scalability as graph sizes increase. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that learns to focus on relevant graph regions through a cascade of attention mechanisms. HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including PubMed and Reddit, while reducing computation time by up to 75% compared to previous graph attention-based methods. We also provide theoretical analysis of HGAT's convergence properties and demonstrate its applicability to real-world problems in social network analysis and bioinformatics.
