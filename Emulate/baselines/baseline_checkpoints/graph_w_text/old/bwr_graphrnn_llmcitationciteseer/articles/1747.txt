Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing accessible conversational interfaces for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults with mild cognitive impairments and their caregivers, identifying key challenges and preferences. Our findings inform the development of a novel conversation framework, 'EasyChat', which incorporates simplification strategies, error prevention, and personalized assistance. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates that EasyChat significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
