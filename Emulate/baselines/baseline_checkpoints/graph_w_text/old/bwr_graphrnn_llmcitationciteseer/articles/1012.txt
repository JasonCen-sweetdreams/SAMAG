Relational graph embedding has emerged as a crucial task in various applications, including social network analysis and recommender systems. However, most existing methods ignore the temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures present in these graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that learns to embed temporal relational graphs by capturing both local and global structural patterns. Our approach leverages multi-scale attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges at different hierarchical levels. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in improving link prediction and node classification tasks.
