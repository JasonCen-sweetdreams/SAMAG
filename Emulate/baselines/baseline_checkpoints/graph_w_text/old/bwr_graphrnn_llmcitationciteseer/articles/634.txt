Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that incorporates both user and item relationships to generate personalized explanations. We employ a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant user-item interactions, allowing the model to provide informative and interpretable recommendations. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
