Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing complex relationships between entities. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the scale and complexity of graph data. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'GrapHi', that leverages hierarchical graph decomposition and adaptive caching to accelerate query processing. Our approach reduces query latency by up to 3x and improves indexing efficiency by up to 5x compared to state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate GrapHi on several real-world graph datasets and demonstrate its applicability to various graph query languages.
