Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, 'DRL-Optimizer', learns to navigate the vast search space of possible plans by interacting with a simulator that mimics real-world database workloads. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate that DRL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, reducing query latency by up to 30% and improving resource utilization by up to 25%. We also provide insights into the learned strategies and their applicability to different database scenarios.
