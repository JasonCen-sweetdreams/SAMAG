Time-series data is ubiquitous in many applications, but its high dimensionality and complex patterns pose significant challenges for representation learning. This paper presents a novel online meta-learning approach, 'MetaTS', which adapts to new, unseen time-series data by leveraging knowledge learned from previous datasets. Our method uses a neural network-based meta-learner to generate task-specific encoders, enabling efficient representation learning for new tasks without requiring full retraining. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that MetaTS outperforms state-of-the-art online learning methods in terms of representation quality and adaptation speed.
