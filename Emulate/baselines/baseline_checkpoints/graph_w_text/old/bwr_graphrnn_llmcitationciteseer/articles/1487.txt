This paper presents a novel gesture recognition system designed specifically for older adults with motor impairments. Our approach leverages a machine learning model that adapts to individual users' abilities and limitations, improving recognition accuracy and user experience. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, aged 65-85, with varying levels of motor impairment, and evaluated our system's performance using a custom-designed gesture set. Results show that our adaptive system outperforms traditional gesture recognition systems, achieving an average recognition rate of 92.5% compared to 75.2% for non-adaptive systems.
