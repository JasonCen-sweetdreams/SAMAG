Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Traditional optimization techniques often rely on heuristics or rule-based approaches that may not adapt well to dynamic workloads. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our approach, called 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn a query optimization policy that minimizes response time and resource utilization. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
