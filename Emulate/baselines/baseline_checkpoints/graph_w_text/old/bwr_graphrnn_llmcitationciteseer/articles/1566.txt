The increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads poses significant challenges in terms of traffic management and safety. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'AV-MA', that coordinates the behavior of AVs to optimize traffic flow and minimize congestion. Our approach leverages decentralized actor-critic algorithms to enable AVs to learn from their environment and adapt to changing traffic conditions. Experimental results using a large-scale traffic simulation platform demonstrate that AV-MA outperforms traditional traffic signal control methods in reducing travel times and improving safety.
