The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of data, making query optimization a critical challenge. Traditional indexing techniques struggle to handle massive datasets, resulting in poor query performance. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'IoT-LIX', which leverages learned indexes to accelerate query execution. By integrating machine learning models with database indexing, IoT-LIX achieves significant speedups over state-of-the-art indexing methods. We evaluate IoT-LIX on a real-world IoT dataset, demonstrating up to 5x improvement in query response time and 3x reduction in storage requirements.
