In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often involve complex interactions and dependencies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture to improve the explainability of multi-agent decision-making. Our approach models agent interactions as a hierarchical graph, where attention mechanisms are applied at multiple levels to selectively focus on relevant information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study on autonomous vehicles, where HAN outperforms existing methods in terms of decision-making accuracy and interpretability.
