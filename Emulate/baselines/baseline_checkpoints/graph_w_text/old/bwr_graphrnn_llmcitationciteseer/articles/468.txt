The proliferation of big data has led to an increased need for efficient query optimization techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based indexing approach that leverages the structural properties of data to accelerate query execution. Our approach, called GraphOpt, represents the data as a graph and utilizes graph-based algorithms to identify optimal query plans. We evaluate GraphOpt on a range of real-world datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional query optimization techniques. The results show that GraphOpt achieves up to 5x speedup in query execution time while maintaining accuracy and scalability.
