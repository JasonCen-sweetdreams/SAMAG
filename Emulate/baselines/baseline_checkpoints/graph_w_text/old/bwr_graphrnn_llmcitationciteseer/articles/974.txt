Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We designed a novel avatar creation system that incorporates user preferences, personality traits, and physical characteristics. Our user study with 120 participants reveals that personalized avatars lead to increased user satisfaction, immersion, and overall engagement in VR applications. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems, highlighting the importance of avatar personalization in enhancing user experience.
