Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn and interact with complex spatial information. This study explores the role of gestural feedback in enhancing spatial reasoning skills in VR environments. We designed an experimental platform that incorporates embodied cognition principles, where users perform gestures to manipulate virtual objects and receive haptic feedback. Our results show that participants who received gestural feedback significantly outperformed those who did not, demonstrating improved spatial awareness and problem-solving abilities. These findings have implications for the design of VR-based educational tools and interfaces that leverage embodied cognition to enhance learning outcomes.
