This paper explores the design and evaluation of a voice-assisted navigation system tailored to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and preferences in navigation, and developed a multimodal interface incorporating natural language processing, speech recognition, and spatial audio cues. Our prototype, 'EasyPath', was tested with 20 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in navigation accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional GPS-based navigation systems. The findings inform the development of accessible, voice-driven interfaces for older adults and individuals with cognitive disabilities.
