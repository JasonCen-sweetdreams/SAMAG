This paper presents a novel framework for coordinating multi-agent systems using hierarchical task networks (HTNs). We propose a decentralized task allocation algorithm that leverages HTNs to represent complex tasks and dependencies. Our approach enables agents to dynamically adjust their task assignments based on changing environmental conditions and team performance. Experimental results demonstrate improved coordination efficiency and adaptability in simulated disaster response scenarios. We also provide a formal analysis of the algorithm's complexity and convergence properties.
