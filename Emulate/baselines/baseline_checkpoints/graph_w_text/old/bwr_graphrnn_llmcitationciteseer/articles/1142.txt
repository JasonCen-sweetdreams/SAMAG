Multi-modal time series forecasting is a crucial task in various applications, including healthcare, finance, and climate modeling. However, existing deep learning approaches struggle to scale with the increasing complexity of modern datasets. This paper proposes a novel architecture, 'MultiCast', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively integrate information from diverse modalities. We demonstrate that MultiCast achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, while reducing computational costs by up to 75% compared to existing models. Our approach enables accurate and efficient forecasting in real-world applications with high-dimensional, heterogeneous data streams.
