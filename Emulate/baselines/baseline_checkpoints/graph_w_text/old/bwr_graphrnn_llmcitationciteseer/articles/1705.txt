Distributed database systems are increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively optimize query plans. We introduce 'RL-Optimizer', a framework that learns to navigate the vast space of possible query plans using a reward function based on execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-Optimizer achieves significant performance improvements over traditional optimization techniques, while adapting to changing workload and system conditions.
