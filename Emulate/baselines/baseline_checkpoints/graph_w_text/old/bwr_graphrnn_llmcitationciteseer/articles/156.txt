Materialized views are a crucial optimization technique in database systems, but their maintenance in distributed settings poses significant challenges. This paper presents a novel approach, called 'Distributed View Refresh' (DVR), which leverages a combination of incremental view maintenance and distributed query processing to reduce the maintenance cost of materialized views. DVR exploits the inherent parallelism in distributed systems to refresh views efficiently, minimizing the impact on query performance. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DVR outperforms existing approaches by up to 3x in terms of maintenance time and 2x in terms of query throughput.
