As the global population ages, designing accessible conversational interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments is crucial. This paper presents a novel framework, 'CARE', which integrates cognitive load management, emotional support, and personalized feedback to facilitate effective communication. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults with mild cognitive impairments and found that CARE significantly improved their interaction experience, reducing speech recognition errors and increasing user satisfaction. Our results have implications for the development of inclusive conversational systems that cater to diverse user needs.
