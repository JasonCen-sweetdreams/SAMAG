This paper presents an exploratory study on designing adaptive gesture-based interfaces for individuals with motor disabilities. We propose a novel framework that leverages machine learning-based gesture recognition and adaptive feedback mechanisms to accommodate varying levels of motor abilities. Our user-centered design approach involved co-designing with participants with motor disabilities, resulting in a customizable interface that adjusts gesture recognition thresholds and feedback modalities in real-time. Pilot studies demonstrate improved interaction accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional gesture-based interfaces.
