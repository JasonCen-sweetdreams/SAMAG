As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible and user-friendly smart home systems. This paper presents a study on designing voice-controlled conversational interfaces for older adults, focusing on usability, accessibility, and user experience. We conducted a mixed-methods study, involving 30 older adults, to investigate the impact of interface design elements on user performance and satisfaction. Our results show that a simplified dialogue flow, clear and concise audio feedback, and adaptive volume control significantly improve the user experience for older adults. We also identify key design recommendations for accessible conversational interfaces in smart home systems.
