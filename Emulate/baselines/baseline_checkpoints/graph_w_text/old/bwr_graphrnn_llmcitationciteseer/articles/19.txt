Multi-agent planning is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence, where a team of agents must coordinate to achieve a common goal. However, existing approaches often struggle with scalability as the number of agents and tasks increases. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task network (HTN) framework, 'MA-Plan', which enables efficient planning for large-scale multi-agent systems. By decomposing complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks and exploiting hierarchical dependencies, MA-Plan reduces the planning complexity and achieves significant speedups compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark domains demonstrate the efficacy of MA-Plan in solving real-world multi-agent planning problems.
