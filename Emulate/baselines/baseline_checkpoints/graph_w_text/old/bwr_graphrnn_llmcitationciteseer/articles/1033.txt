Despite their widespread adoption, recommendation systems often suffer from a lack of transparency and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attentional Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) architecture that integrates both item and user graph structures to provide personalized recommendations. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant items and users, enabling explainable recommendations. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of HAGNN compared to state-of-the-art models. We further provide visualizations and case studies to illustrate the model's ability to provide actionable insights into user preferences and item relationships.
