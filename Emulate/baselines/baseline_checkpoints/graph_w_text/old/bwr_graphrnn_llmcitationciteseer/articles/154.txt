In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'DRL-TA', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. We propose a decentralized, communication-efficient protocol where agents learn to adapt their task preferences based on local observations and feedback. Experimental results on a variety of task scenarios demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and robustness to agent failures.
