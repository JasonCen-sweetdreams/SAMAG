This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for cooperative task allocation in dynamic environments. We introduce a novel communication protocol that enables agents to share task-related information and learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. Our approach, called 'Cooperative Task Allocation via Multi-Agent Deep Q-Networks' (CTA-MA-DQN), is evaluated in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, where multiple drones must work together to locate and retrieve victims. Experimental results show that CTA-MA-DQN outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods and existing decentralized approaches in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
