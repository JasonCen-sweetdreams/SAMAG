Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the retrieval effectiveness. Traditional query expansion methods rely on term co-occurrence statistics or lexical databases, which may not capture the semantic nuances of query terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages contextualized word embeddings to model query terms in a dense vector space. Our approach, 'ConExp', uses a neural language model to generate contextualized embeddings for query terms and expands the query using semantically similar terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConExp achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness compared to traditional query expansion methods.
