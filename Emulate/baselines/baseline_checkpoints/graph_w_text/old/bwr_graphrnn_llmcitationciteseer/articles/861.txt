Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. HAN leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant segments and features, enabling the identification of anomaly sources. We evaluate HAN on five benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
