Distributed information retrieval systems face significant query latency due to the vast amounts of data and complex query processing. This paper presents an adaptive indexing approach, 'DynIndex', which dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. DynIndex integrates a machine learning-based query predictor to anticipate query types and adapt the index structure accordingly. Experimental results on a large-scale text dataset demonstrate that DynIndex reduces query latency by up to 30% compared to traditional indexing methods while maintaining query accuracy.
