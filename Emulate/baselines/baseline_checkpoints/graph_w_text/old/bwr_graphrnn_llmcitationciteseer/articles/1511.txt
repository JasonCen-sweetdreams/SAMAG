Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. However, most existing ERS models suffer from limited interpretability and inferior recommendation performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical multi-task attention (HMTA) framework that jointly learns to generate recommendations and provide explanations. HMTA employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global dependencies in user-item interactions, and a multi-task learning strategy to share knowledge between recommendation and explanation tasks. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HMTA in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
