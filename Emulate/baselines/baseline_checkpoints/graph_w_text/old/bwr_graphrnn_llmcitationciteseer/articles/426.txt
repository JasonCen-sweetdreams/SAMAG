Query expansion is a crucial technique in ad-hoc retrieval to improve the precision of search results. Traditional methods rely on term co-occurrence and frequency-based approaches, which can be limited by their reliance on manual feature engineering. This paper proposes a neural semantic embedding-based query expansion framework, 'NEQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. We demonstrate that NEQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
