Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complex technical vocabulary and nuanced relationships between concepts. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion, leveraging hierarchical graph-based embeddings to capture the semantic structure of patent documents. Our method, 'PatentGraph', represents patents as nodes in a graph, where edges denote relationships between concepts, and uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to learn contextualized embeddings. Experimental results on a large patent dataset show that PatentGraph outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of retrieval precision and recall, particularly for queries with ambiguous or rare terms.
