Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can significantly compromise their performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the robustness of DNNs against such attacks. We introduce a hierarchical input transformation framework that leverages the idea of progressive refinement to enhance the model's resilience. Our method involves applying a sequence of carefully crafted transformations to the input data, which helps to mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the robustness of DNNs against a range of attack types.
