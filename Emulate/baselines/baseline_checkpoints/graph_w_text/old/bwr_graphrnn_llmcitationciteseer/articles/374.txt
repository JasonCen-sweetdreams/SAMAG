Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in many homes, but their usability by older adults with cognitive impairments is often limited. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant that accommodates the needs of this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our prototype, 'EasyVoice', incorporates features such as simplified dialogue flows, visual cues, and error forgiveness mechanisms. A usability study with 20 participants showed significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
