In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel negotiation-based auction mechanism for coordinated task allocation. Our approach enables agents to negotiate over task assignments based on their individual capabilities and preferences, leading to improved system-wide performance. We introduce a new utility function that incorporates both agent-centric and system-centric objectives, allowing agents to balance personal goals with global optimality. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion rate and agent satisfaction.
