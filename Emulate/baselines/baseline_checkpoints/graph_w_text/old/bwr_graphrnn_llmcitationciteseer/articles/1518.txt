Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interactions often exclude users with disabilities. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to create inclusive conversational strategies for voice assistants. We conducted user studies with 30 participants with disabilities and identified key challenges and preferences. Our proposed framework, 'IncluVoice', incorporates adaptive dialogue management, personalized feedback, and multimodal input support. A pilot evaluation with 20 users showed significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction. Our findings contribute to the development of more accessible and usable voice assistants for diverse user populations.
