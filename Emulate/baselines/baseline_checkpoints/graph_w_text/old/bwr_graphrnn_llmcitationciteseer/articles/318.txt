Key-value stores are a fundamental building block of modern data infrastructure, but their performance is often bottlenecked by slow indexing mechanisms. This paper presents 'SKIV', a novel secondary indexing technique that leverages a combination of hash-based and tree-based indexing to achieve high lookup performance and efficient storage utilization. SKIV's adaptive indexing strategy dynamically adjusts the indexing structure based on the workload, resulting in significant improvements in throughput and latency compared to existing indexing approaches. Our evaluation on a popular key-value store demonstrates SKIV's ability to sustain high performance under varying workloads and data distributions.
