As the population ages, there is a growing need for accessible and user-friendly interfaces that cater to older adults' unique cognitive and physical abilities. Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have shown promise in reducing cognitive load, but their effectiveness in this context is not well understood. This study investigates the impact of ECAs on cognitive load in older adults using a mixed-methods approach. Our results indicate that ECAs can significantly reduce cognitive load and improve task completion times, particularly for individuals with lower cognitive abilities. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of accessible HCI systems.
