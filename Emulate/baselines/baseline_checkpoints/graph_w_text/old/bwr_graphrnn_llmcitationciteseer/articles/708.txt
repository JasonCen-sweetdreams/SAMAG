This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse skills and capabilities need to be assigned to tasks with varying requirements. We propose a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn effective allocation strategies. Our approach, called DALRA, uses a novel multi-agent Q-learning algorithm that incorporates a graph neural network to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that DALRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and system adaptability.
