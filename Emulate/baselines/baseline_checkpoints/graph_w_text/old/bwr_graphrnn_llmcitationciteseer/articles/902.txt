Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it directly affects the quality of search results. This paper proposes a novel deep query expansion approach, HQE, which leverages hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to model the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. By incorporating contextualized embeddings and graph-based attention mechanisms, HQE is able to capture complex query semantics and generate more effective expansion terms. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly for complex and ambiguous queries.
