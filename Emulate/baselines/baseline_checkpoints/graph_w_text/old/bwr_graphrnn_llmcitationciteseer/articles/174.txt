Distributed information retrieval systems require efficient indexing techniques to facilitate fast query processing. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing approach that dynamically adjusts the index structure based on query patterns and data distribution. Our approach, called ADI, utilizes a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify correlated query terms and constructs a composite index that balances storage overhead with query performance. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that ADI outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving an average query response time reduction of 37% while maintaining a reasonable storage overhead.
