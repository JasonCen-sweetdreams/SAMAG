Node classification in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is a challenging task due to the complexity of node relationships and attribute heterogeneity. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages the strengths of graph attention mechanisms and hierarchical representations. HGAT learns to recursively aggregate node features and attention weights across multiple scales, enabling effective node classification in HINs. Experimental results on several real-world HIN datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and F1-score.
