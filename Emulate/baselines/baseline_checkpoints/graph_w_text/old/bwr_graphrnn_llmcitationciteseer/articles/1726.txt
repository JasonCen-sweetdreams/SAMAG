Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial for various applications, including monitoring industrial equipment, detecting fraudulent transactions, and predicting healthcare outcomes. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) for time series anomaly detection, which incorporates local and global attention mechanisms to identify salient features and contextual relationships. Our experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for its predictions.
