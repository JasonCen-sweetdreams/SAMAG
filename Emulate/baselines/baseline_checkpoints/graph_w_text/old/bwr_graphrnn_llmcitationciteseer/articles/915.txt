Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective passage retrieval to provide accurate answers. While state-of-the-art models achieve impressive results, they often struggle with queries that require contextual understanding or contain ambiguous keywords. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, 'QDE', which generates additional relevant passages by iteratively refining the query representation based on the retrieved documents. We evaluate QDE on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in passage retrieval accuracy and downstream question answering performance.
