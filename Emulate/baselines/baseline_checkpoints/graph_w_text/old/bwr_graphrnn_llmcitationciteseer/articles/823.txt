Explainable recommendation systems are crucial for building trust with users. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages item relationships and user behaviors to provide personalized recommendations with transparent explanations. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both local and global dependencies in the user-item graph, and generates explanations by highlighting influential items and features. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art models.
