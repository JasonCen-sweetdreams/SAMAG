In multi-agent systems, cooperative decision-making requires effective communication and attention to relevant information. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables agents to selectively focus on salient features and messages from other agents. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent relationships and learn cooperative strategies. We evaluate HAN on a realistic simulation of autonomous vehicles and demonstrate improved coordination and explainability compared to existing methods. The proposed framework has potential applications in autonomous systems, robot teams, and human-robot collaboration.
