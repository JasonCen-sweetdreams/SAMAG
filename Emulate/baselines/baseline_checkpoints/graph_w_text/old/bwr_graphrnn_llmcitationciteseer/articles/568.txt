Gesture recognition systems have become ubiquitous in human-computer interaction, but individuals with motor impairments often face significant barriers in using these systems. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive gesture recognition systems that can accommodate a wide range of motor abilities. We propose a participatory design approach that involves individuals with motor impairments in the design process, and develop a machine learning-based gesture recognition algorithm that can adapt to varying levels of motor impairment. Our evaluation with 20 participants with motor impairments shows that our system achieves an average recognition accuracy of 92%, outperforming existing commercial systems.
