Virtual reality (VR) technology has made significant strides in recent years, but user interaction remains a major bottleneck. This paper explores the use of gaze-based interaction as a natural and intuitive method for VR interfaces. We conducted a user study to investigate the impact of gaze-based interaction on user experience and eye movement patterns. Our results show that gaze-based interaction reduces cognitive load and improves task completion time compared to traditional controller-based methods. We also analyzed the eye movement patterns of users and identified key features that can inform the design of more effective VR interfaces.
