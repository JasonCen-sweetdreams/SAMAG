The rapid growth of time-series data in various fields has necessitated the development of efficient clustering algorithms. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'HierTS', for hierarchical clustering of large-scale time-series data. HierTS leverages the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn robust feature representations and identify meaningful clusters. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierTS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications such as anomaly detection and forecasting.
