State-of-the-art neural ranking models in information retrieval (IR) often rely on complex query-document interaction mechanisms, leading to increased computational costs. This paper presents a novel approach, Neural Query Graphs (NQG), which models queries as graph structures to capture nuanced relationships between entities and keywords. By leveraging graph attention mechanisms, NQG efficiently computes relevance scores and achieves significant improvements in ranking accuracy on several benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of NQG in handling long-tail queries and out-of-vocabulary words.
