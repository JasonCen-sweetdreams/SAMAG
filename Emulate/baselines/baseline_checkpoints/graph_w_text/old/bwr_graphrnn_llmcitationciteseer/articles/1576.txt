This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have varying capabilities and tasks require different skill sets. We propose a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a task allocation policy that maximizes system efficiency. Our method, called GNN-TA, represents the agent-task relationships as a graph and trains a GNN to predict the optimal task assignments. We evaluate GNN-TA on a set of simulated scenarios and demonstrate its effectiveness in adapting to changing agent and task configurations. The results show that GNN-TA outperforms traditional centralized and distributed task allocation methods in terms of system throughput and fairness.
