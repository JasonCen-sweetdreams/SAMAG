In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects overall system performance. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the agent-task interaction as a graph and propose a novel GNN architecture that learns to allocate tasks efficiently. Our approach leverages the structural properties of the graph to enable agents to make decisions autonomously, without requiring a centralized controller. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving near-optimal allocation while adapting to dynamic changes in the environment.
