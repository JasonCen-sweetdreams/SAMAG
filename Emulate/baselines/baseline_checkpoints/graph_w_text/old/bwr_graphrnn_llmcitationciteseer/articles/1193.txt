Explainability has become a critical aspect of AI-powered recommendation systems, as it enables developers to understand and improve their models. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that leverages both item relationships and user preferences to provide transparent and personalized recommendations. Our approach employs a multi-level attention mechanism to capture complex dependencies between items, while also incorporating user feedback to adapt the recommendation process. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing intuitive explanations for its recommendation decisions.
