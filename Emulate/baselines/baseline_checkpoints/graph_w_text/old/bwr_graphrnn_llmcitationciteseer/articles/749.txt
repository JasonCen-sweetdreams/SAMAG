This paper presents a novel approach to gesture recognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, which dynamically adapts to individual users' behavior and preferences. Our system, 'GestureFit', utilizes machine learning algorithms to learn user-specific gesture patterns and adjust recognition thresholds accordingly. We evaluate GestureFit through a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches. The results have implications for enhancing user experience in VR applications, such as gaming, education, and healthcare.
