Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained increasing attention in recent years. However, most existing ERS models rely on oversimplified user-item interaction graphs, neglecting complex relationships between items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAN) framework, which leverages multi-level graph attention mechanisms to capture both local and global item relationships. We evaluate HGAN on three real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our results suggest that HGAN can effectively provide transparent and personalized recommendations to users.
