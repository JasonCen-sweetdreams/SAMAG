Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, query processing on large graph datasets remains a significant performance bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'GraphSprint', which leverages a hybrid combination of graph partitioning, vertex indexing, and query optimization. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphSprint achieves up to 5x faster query processing times compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques, while maintaining a reasonable index size and construction time.
