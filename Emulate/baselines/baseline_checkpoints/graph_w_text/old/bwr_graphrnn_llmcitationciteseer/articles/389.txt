Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that leverages both local and global temporal dependencies to detect anomalies. Our approach incorporates attention mechanisms to focus on relevant segments of the time series, enabling the identification of contributing factors to anomalies. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies and providing insights into their underlying causes.
