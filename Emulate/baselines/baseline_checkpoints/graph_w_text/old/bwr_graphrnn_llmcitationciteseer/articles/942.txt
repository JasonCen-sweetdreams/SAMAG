Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but existing interfaces often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework, 'AccessibleVR', which integrates audio and haptic feedback to enable users with visual impairments to navigate and interact with virtual environments. We evaluate AccessibleVR through a user study involving 20 participants with visual impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces.
