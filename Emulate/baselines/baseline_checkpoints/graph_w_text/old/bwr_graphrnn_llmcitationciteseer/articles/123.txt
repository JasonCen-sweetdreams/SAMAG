Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when faced with limited training data. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach, 'Hierarchical Task Embeddings' (HTE), which learns to adapt to new tasks by representing tasks as hierarchical embeddings. HTE leverages a task encoder to map task descriptions into a hierarchical space, enabling the model to capture task relationships and transfer knowledge across tasks. We evaluate HTE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in few-shot classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
