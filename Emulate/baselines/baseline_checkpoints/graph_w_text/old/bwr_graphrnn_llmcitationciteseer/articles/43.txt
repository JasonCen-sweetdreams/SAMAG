Autonomous drones have the potential to revolutionize various industries, but their navigation systems often lack transparency and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel explainable reinforcement learning (RL) framework, 'DroneX', which integrates model-agnostic explanation techniques with deep RL algorithms. DroneX uses attention-based visualization and feature attribution to provide insights into the decision-making process of the drone's navigation policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DroneX in a realistic drone racing environment, where it achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art RL methods while providing actionable explanations for its actions.
