In multi-agent systems, trust management is crucial for effective collaboration and decision-making. This paper proposes a novel decentralized trust management framework that leverages blockchain technology and reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'TrustChain', enables agents to maintain a tamper-proof trust ledger, which records transactional interactions and updates trust values using a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TrustChain in a simulated multi-agent scenario, showcasing improved trust accuracy and robustness against malicious agents compared to traditional centralized trust management approaches.
