In multi-agent systems, efficient resource allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, the complexities of real-world environments render traditional optimization methods inadequate. This paper presents a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to coordinate agents in adaptive resource allocation tasks. Our approach, dubbed 'DeepCoord', utilizes a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn cooperative policies that balance individual agent objectives with global system efficiency. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate that DeepCoord outperforms traditional optimization methods and adapts effectively to changing system dynamics.
