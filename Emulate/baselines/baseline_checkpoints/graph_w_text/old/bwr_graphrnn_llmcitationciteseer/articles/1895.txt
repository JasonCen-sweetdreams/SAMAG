Proximity search in high-dimensional spaces is a fundamental problem in many computer vision and machine learning applications. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing technique based on quantization trees, which reduces the search time and memory requirements compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach leverages the properties of quantization errors to prune the search space and focuses on the most promising regions. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of search efficiency and accuracy.
