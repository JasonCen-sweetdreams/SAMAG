Optimizing query performance in distributed relational databases is crucial for many applications. Existing approaches often rely on rule-based or cost-based optimization, which can be suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict the optimal join order and indexing strategy for a given query workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while reducing optimization time by an order of magnitude.
