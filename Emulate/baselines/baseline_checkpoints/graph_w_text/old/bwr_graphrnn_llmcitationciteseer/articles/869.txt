Ad-hoc search remains a fundamental challenge in Information Retrieval (IR). Existing methods rely on flat document representations, which can lead to suboptimal retrieval efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation framework, HierDoc, which captures nuanced semantic relationships between documents. By incorporating a hierarchical attention mechanism, HierDoc effectively prunes irrelevant documents, reducing the search space and improving retrieval efficiency. Experiments on the TREC-8 Ad-hoc dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and query latency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
