This paper investigates the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to improve user experience. We design and evaluate a gesture-based interaction system that leverages users' bodily gestures to enhance cognitive processing and engagement in VR environments. Our study involves 30 participants performing a series of tasks in a VR setup, with half using traditional controller-based input and the other half using our gesture-based system. Results show significant improvements in user performance, satisfaction, and cognitive load reduction when using the gesture-based approach. We discuss the implications of our findings on the design of more intuitive and immersive VR interfaces.
