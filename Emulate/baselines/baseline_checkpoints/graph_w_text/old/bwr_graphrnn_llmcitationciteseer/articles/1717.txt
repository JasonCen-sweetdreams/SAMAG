Column-oriented NoSQL databases have gained popularity for storing and querying large-scale data. However, optimizing query performance for multi-dimensional range queries remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'CORONA', which leverages a hybrid indexing approach combining bitmap and spatial indexing techniques. We introduce a cost model that accurately estimates the query execution cost based on the query predicate and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that CORONA outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
