Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in many applications, but the lack of interpretability hinders trust in AI-driven systems. This paper presents HATN, a hierarchical attention network that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights into the decision-making process. HATN leverages a novel self-attention mechanism to identify relevant contextual features and a hierarchical pooling strategy to capture complex patterns at multiple scales. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HATN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both detection accuracy and explainability, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.
