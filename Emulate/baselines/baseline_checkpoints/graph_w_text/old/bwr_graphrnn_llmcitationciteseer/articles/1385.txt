Virtual reality (VR) has immense potential for entertainment, education, and therapy, but user engagement remains a significant hurdle. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed an experiment using a custom-built VR platform, where participants interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, as measured by time spent in the VR environment, self-reported satisfaction, and physiological metrics. We also identify key factors influencing avatar personalization, including facial similarity, clothing preferences, and personality traits.
