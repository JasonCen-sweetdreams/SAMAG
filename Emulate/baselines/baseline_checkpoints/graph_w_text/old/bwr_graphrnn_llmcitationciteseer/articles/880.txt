This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for autonomous traffic signal control. We model the traffic signal control problem as a decentralized Markov decision process, where each agent learns to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. Our approach utilizes a novel communication protocol that enables agents to share information and coordinate their actions in real-time. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized control methods and scales to large networks with hundreds of intersections.
