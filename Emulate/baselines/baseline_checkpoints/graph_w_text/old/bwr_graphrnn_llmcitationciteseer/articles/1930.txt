Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, where the goal is to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. This paper proposes a novel ranking-based QE approach, dubbed 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn a query representation that effectively captures the context and semantics of the original query. Our method exploits a siamese neural network architecture to jointly learn query and document embeddings, enabling effective ranking of potential expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance.
