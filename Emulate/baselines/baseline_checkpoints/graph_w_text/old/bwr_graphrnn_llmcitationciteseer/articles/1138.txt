Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is a fundamental task in AI, aiming to represent entities and relationships in a low-dimensional vector space. However, most existing methods neglect the hierarchical structure inherent in knowledge graphs, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose H-GAT, a novel KGE approach that leverages hierarchical graph attention networks to capture entity relationships at multiple scales. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that H-GAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of link prediction, entity classification, and knowledge graph completion tasks.
