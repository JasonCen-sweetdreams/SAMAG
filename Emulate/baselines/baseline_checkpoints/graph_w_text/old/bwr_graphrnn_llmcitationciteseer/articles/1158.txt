Distributed databases employing multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) face significant performance degradation due to the overhead of query optimization. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MVCC-OPT', which leverages a combination of static and dynamic analysis to identify optimal query plans. We introduce a probabilistic model to estimate the likelihood of version conflicts and develop a cost-based optimizer that integrates with existing MVCC protocols. Experimental results on a distributed database benchmark demonstrate that MVCC-OPT reduces query latency by up to 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques, while maintaining strong consistency guarantees.
