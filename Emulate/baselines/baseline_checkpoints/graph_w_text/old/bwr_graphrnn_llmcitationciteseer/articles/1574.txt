In multi-agent systems, decision-making involves complex interactions between agents with diverse goals and behaviors. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in such systems. Our HAN model captures agent-level and system-level interactions using attention mechanisms, allowing for transparent and interpretable decision-making. We evaluate our approach on a real-world traffic control scenario, demonstrating improved decision quality and reduced uncertainty compared to existing methods.
