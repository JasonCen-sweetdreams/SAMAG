This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for adaptive traffic signal control. Our approach, called 'TrafficMA', enables each agent to learn its own policy for optimizing traffic flow, while coordinating with neighboring agents to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. We introduce a novel communication protocol that allows agents to share local state information and negotiate joint actions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of TrafficMA in a realistic simulation environment. Experimental results show that TrafficMA outperforms traditional fixed-time signal control and other state-of-the-art methods in terms of average travel time, queue length, and traffic signal utilization.
