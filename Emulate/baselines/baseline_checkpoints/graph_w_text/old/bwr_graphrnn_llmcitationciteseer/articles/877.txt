Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant framework, 'CognitiveCompanion', which incorporates personalized cognitive support, multimodal interaction, and caregiver integration. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in user engagement and task completion rates compared to existing voice assistants.
