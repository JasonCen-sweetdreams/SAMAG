Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a popular technique to improve retrieval performance, but it often relies on hand-crafted features and rules. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework, 'NQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn query-document interactions. NQE employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively expand queries based on context-aware document representations. Our experiments on the TREC dataset demonstrate that NQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of mean average precision.
