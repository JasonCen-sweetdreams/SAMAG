Subquery evaluation is a critical component of distributed database systems, but it can be computationally expensive. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize subquery evaluation in distributed settings. We propose an RL-based approach that learns to select the most efficient subquery evaluation strategy based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional rule-based methods by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
