Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture the semantic nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel neural semantic field-based approach for query expansion, which learns to contextualize query terms within a dense, vectorized representation of the retrieval space. Our method, dubbed 'NeuroQE', leverages the strengths of both neural language models and traditional retrieval techniques to generate high-quality, context-aware expansions. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
