In multi-agent systems, efficient communication is crucial for real-time task allocation. Existing frameworks often suffer from scalability issues, leading to increased latency and decreased system performance. This paper presents a novel agent communication framework, 'FlexiCom', designed to address these limitations. FlexiCom leverages a hierarchical architecture and a publish-subscribe mechanism to enable flexible and efficient communication among agents. We evaluate FlexiCom using a realistic disaster response scenario, demonstrating significant improvements in task allocation efficiency and system scalability compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.
