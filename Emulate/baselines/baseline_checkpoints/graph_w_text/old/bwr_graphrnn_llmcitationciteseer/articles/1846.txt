Node classification in large-scale graphs is a fundamental task in many applications, but existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages a hierarchical graph representation to reduce the number of attention mechanisms. We introduce a probabilistic node sampling strategy to select the most informative nodes at each level, and a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively aggregates node features. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance with significant reductions in computational cost and memory usage.
