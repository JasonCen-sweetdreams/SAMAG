Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CARE', a conversational AI system tailored to the needs of older adults with dementia. We employed a user-centered design approach, involving participatory design workshops and usability testing with 20 older adults and 10 caregivers. Our results show that CARE's simplified language, visual cues, and error tolerance features significantly improved interaction outcomes and user satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of accessible conversational interfaces in healthcare and beyond.
