Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents from a large corpus. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) framework that leverages a two-stage approach to reduce the search space. The first stage uses a coarse-grained retriever to select top-k documents, followed by a fine-grained retriever that re-ranks candidates using a dense passage representation. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset show that HDR achieves a 20% increase in recall@10 compared to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods, while reducing the computational cost by 3x.
