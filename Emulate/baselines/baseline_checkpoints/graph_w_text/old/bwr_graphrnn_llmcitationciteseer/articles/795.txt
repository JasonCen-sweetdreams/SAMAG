Conversational search systems aim to provide more personalized and engaging user experiences by incorporating context and dialogue history. However, existing ranking models often struggle to effectively leverage this context, leading to suboptimal results. This paper presents a novel context-aware re-ranking framework, CAR, which combines a hierarchical attention mechanism with a graph-based context representation. Our experiments on a large conversational search dataset demonstrate that CAR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, particularly in terms of relevance and diversity of the retrieved results.
