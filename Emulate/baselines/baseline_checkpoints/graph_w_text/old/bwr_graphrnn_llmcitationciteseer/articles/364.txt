Coordinating task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem due to the complexities of agent interactions and environmental uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn effective task allocation policies. Our method, called 'MACA' (Multi-Agent Coordinated Allocation), uses a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to optimize task assignments. Experimental results on several benchmark scenarios demonstrate that MACA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rates, agent utility, and system robustness.
