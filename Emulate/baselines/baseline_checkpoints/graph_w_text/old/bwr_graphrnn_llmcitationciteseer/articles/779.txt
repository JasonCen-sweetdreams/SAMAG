Real-time object detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicle systems. However, the search for optimal neural architectures is typically computationally expensive and requires significant expertise. This paper proposes a novel deep neural architecture search (NAS) framework, 'AVOD-NAS', which leverages reinforcement learning and graph-based search to discover high-performance object detection models. We demonstrate that AVOD-NAS can identify architectures that outperform state-of-the-art models on the KITTI benchmark while reducing search time by an order of magnitude. Our approach has significant implications for the deployment of AI-powered autonomous vehicles.
