The rapid growth of digital data has led to a significant increase in query processing times, making scalable information retrieval a pressing concern. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical semantic indexing (HSI) approach that leverages the semantic relationships between query terms to improve query performance. By constructing a multi-level index that captures both local and global semantic contexts, HSI reduces the number of unnecessary document retrievals and accelerates query processing. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HSI achieves a 30% reduction in average query response time compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods.
