Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the relevance of retrieved documents. However, existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules or simplistic machine learning models. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'QERL', which learns to optimize query expansion policies in an end-to-end manner. QERL leverages a hierarchical neural network to model the complex relationships between query terms, documents, and relevance judgements. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QERL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in retrieval precision and recall.
