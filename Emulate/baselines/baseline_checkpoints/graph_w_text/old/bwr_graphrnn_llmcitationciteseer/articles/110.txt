Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent, resulting in suboptimal query formulations. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using reinforced neural ranking models. Our proposed framework, 'QRN', leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the query expansion process, generating more informative and relevant queries. QRN utilizes a neural ranking model as the reward function, which is trained to predict the relevance of documents to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QRN outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
