Cloud-native applications require efficient resource allocation to ensure high performance and low latency. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, 'CloudOpt', which adaptively allocates resources based on application-specific requirements and dynamic cloud environment conditions. Our method leverages a hybrid actor-critic architecture to learn a policy that balances resource utilization and application performance. Experimental results on a real-world cloud platform demonstrate that CloudOpt outperforms state-of-the-art resource allocation methods by up to 30% in terms of response time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
