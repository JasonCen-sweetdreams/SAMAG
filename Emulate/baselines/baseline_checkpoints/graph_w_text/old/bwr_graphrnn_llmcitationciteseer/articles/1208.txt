In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and fair distribution of tasks among agents. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages blockchain technology to design incentive mechanisms. Our approach, called 'ChainTask', utilizes smart contracts to create a transparent and tamper-proof environment, where agents are incentivized to participate in task execution based on their reputation and contribution. We evaluate ChainTask using a simulated environment and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving system efficiency, fairness, and robustness compared to traditional centralized approaches.
