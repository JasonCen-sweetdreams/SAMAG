Optimizing query execution in distributed relational databases is crucial for improving performance and scalability. Traditional query optimizers rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which often lead to suboptimal plans. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'RL-Optimizer', that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. We design a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation that captures the query optimization problem and train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that RL-Optimizer achieves significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art optimizers, with an average reduction of 30% in query execution time.
