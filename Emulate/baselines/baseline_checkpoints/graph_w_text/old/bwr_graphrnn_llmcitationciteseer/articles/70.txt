Search engines often struggle to provide diverse search results, leading to a lack of novelty and redundancy in the retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, 'QDE', which aims to improve search result diversity by identifying and incorporating relevant subtopics and aspects. QDE leverages a combination of natural language processing and graph-based methods to generate a set of expanded documents that better capture the query intent. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that QDE outperforms existing methods in terms of search result diversity and relevance, while maintaining a comparable computational efficiency.
