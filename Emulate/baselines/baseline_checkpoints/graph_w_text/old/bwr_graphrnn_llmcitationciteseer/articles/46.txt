Cold start problem is a long-standing challenge in recommendation systems, where users or items have limited interaction history. This paper proposes a novel hybrid retrieval model, 'HyRec', which combines the strengths of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. HyRec utilizes a graph-based attention mechanism to incorporate item relationships and a neural retriever to capture semantic similarities between users and items. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that HyRec outperforms state-of-the-art methods in addressing the cold start problem, with significant improvements in recall and precision.
