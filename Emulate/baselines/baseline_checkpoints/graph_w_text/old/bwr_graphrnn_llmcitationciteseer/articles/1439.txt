In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem due to the lack of centralized control and limited communication between agents. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to allocate tasks to agents in a decentralized manner. We introduce a distributed Q-learning algorithm that enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Our approach is evaluated in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing methods.
