Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-based machine learning, where the goal is to classify new nodes with limited labeled data. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs. HGAT consists of a hierarchical encoder that learns node representations at multiple scales, followed by a few-shot classifier that adapts to new classes with limited labeled data. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, especially when the number of labeled nodes is extremely limited.
