Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing queries in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the system's current state and query workload. Our experiments on a simulated DDS environment show that the RL-based approach outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimization methods by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
