State-of-the-art neural ranking models have significantly improved the accuracy of document retrieval in search engines. However, their computational cost and memory requirements hinder their adoption in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel hybrid neural ranking model, 'HybridRank', which combines the strengths of both neural and traditional ranking models. By leveraging a hierarchical attention mechanism and a lightweight neural network architecture, HybridRank achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models while reducing computational cost by 30% and memory usage by 40%. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HybridRank in improving search engine efficiency and user experience.
