Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly improve the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, which leverages document representation learning to identify relevant terms for expansion. Our approach, called DeepQE, uses a neural network to learn a dense representation of documents and queries, and then uses this representation to identify the most informative terms for expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance.
