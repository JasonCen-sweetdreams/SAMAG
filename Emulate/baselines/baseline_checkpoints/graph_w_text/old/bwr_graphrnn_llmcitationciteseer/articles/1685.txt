Traditional relevance models in information retrieval (IR) rely on explicit feature engineering and simplistic document representations. We propose a novel neural graph-based relevance model, 'GraphIR', which leverages the structural relationships between documents and queries to capture complex relevance patterns. GraphIR represents documents as graphs of entity relationships and learns a relevance function using a graph neural network. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, including BERT-based approaches, in terms of ranking accuracy and computational efficiency.
