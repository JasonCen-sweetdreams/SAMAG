Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but existing interfaces often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework, 'AccessibleVR', which incorporates haptic feedback, audio cues, and voice commands to enable visually impaired users to navigate and interact with virtual environments. We conducted user studies with 20 participants and found that AccessibleVR improved task completion rates by 35% and user satisfaction by 42% compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our results inform the development of more inclusive VR experiences, promoting equal access to immersive technologies.
