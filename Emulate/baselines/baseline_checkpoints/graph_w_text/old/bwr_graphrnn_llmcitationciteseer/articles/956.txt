In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'MA-RL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. MA-RL utilizes a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn task allocation policies. Experimental results on a range of scenarios demonstrate that MA-RL outperforms traditional centralized and distributed methods in terms of task completion time and system utility. We also analyze the impact of agent communication topology on the performance of MA-RL.
