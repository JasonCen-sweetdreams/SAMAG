Multi-tenant database systems are increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing queries for multiple tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization technique, 'MQOpt', which leverages a combination of cost-based optimization and machine learning to minimize query latency and resource utilization. We propose a tenant-aware cost model that captures the nuanced interactions between tenants and develop a reinforcement learning framework to adaptively optimize query plans. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database show that MQOpt reduces query latency by up to 35% and improves resource utilization by 20% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
