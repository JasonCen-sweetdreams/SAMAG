Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving and ranking relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a given question. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HNR, which leverages both coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic representations of passages to improve ranking accuracy. Our approach consists of a passage encoder, a hierarchical attention mechanism, and a ranking module. Experimental results on the SQuAD-Open and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that HNR outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving a 5.2% improvement in top-1 accuracy and a 3.1% improvement in mean reciprocal rank.
