Distributed search engines are critical for scalable information retrieval, but query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'DNR', which leverages deep learning techniques to optimize query processing in distributed search architectures. By incorporating query semantics and document relevance into a unified neural framework, DNR achieves significant improvements in query throughput and relevance ranking accuracy compared to traditional approaches. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of DNR in real-world search engine applications.
