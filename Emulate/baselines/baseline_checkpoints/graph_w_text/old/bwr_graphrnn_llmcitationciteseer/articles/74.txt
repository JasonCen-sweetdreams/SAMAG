This paper addresses the problem of decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities and constraints need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel reinforcement learning-based approach, 'Dec-TARL', which enables agents to learn effective task allocation strategies through interactions with their environment. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to represent agent relationships and jointly optimize task allocation and agent routing. Experimental results on a range of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the superiority of Dec-TARL over traditional optimization-based methods, achieving improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead.
