Ad-hoc retrieval systems continue to struggle with query ambiguity and term mismatch, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-Net', which leverages deep neural networks to model complex query-document relationships. HQE-Net employs a two-stage architecture, where a query encoder generates a dense representation of the query, and a document encoder generates a hierarchical representation of the document. The two representations are then combined to generate an expanded query, which is used to retrieve relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQE-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, including those based on traditional term weighting and pseudo-relevance feedback.
