Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must cooperate to accomplish complex tasks without a central authority. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to learn decentralized task allocation policies. We introduce a multi-agent deep Q-network (MA-DQN) that leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Experimental results on a range of scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized algorithms in terms of task completion rate and resource efficiency, while adapting to dynamic changes in the system.
