Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel graph-based query rewriting approach, called GraphQR, which leverages graph theory to model data dependencies and optimize query plans. GraphQR reduces the search space of possible query plans by exploiting the structural properties of the data graph, resulting in improved query performance and reduced latency. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphQR in optimizing query execution time compared to traditional optimization techniques.
