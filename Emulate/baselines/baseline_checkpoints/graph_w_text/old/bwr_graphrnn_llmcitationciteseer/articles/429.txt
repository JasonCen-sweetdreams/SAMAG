Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in modern data warehousing and big data analytics. However, optimizing query execution in such systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of query plans and the dynamic nature of distributed environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and develop a deep Q-network-based algorithm that learns to optimize query plans based on runtime feedback. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time.
