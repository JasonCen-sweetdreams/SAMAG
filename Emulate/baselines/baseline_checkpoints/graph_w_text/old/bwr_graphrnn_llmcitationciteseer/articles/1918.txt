Search result diversification aims to provide users with a diverse set of relevant documents in response to a query. Existing methods rely on static document representations, which can lead to suboptimal diversification. This paper proposes a context-aware document representation model, 'CADR', which incorporates query-dependent and user-dependent information to capture the nuanced semantic relationships between documents. Our experiments on a large-scale Web corpus demonstrate that CADR outperforms state-of-the-art diversification methods in terms of novelty, redundancy, and relevance, while reducing computational overhead.
