Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but its adoption is hindered by usability issues. This study explores the effects of personalization on user experience in VR interfaces. We designed and implemented a VR system that adapts to users' preferences, cognitive styles, and behavioral patterns. Our user study (N=60) reveals that personalized VR interfaces significantly improve user engagement, reduce cognitive load, and enhance overall satisfaction. We also identify key factors influencing personalization effectiveness, including user expertise and task complexity. The results have important implications for the design of VR systems that cater to diverse user populations.
