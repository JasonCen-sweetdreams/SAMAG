Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph structural properties and machine learning-based cost estimation to optimize query execution plans. Our experimental results on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
