Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. Traditional methods rely on term co-occurrence and frequency-based metrics, often resulting in suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuroXPand', which leverages deep learning to learn semantic relationships between query terms and their expanded counterparts. Our method incorporates a novel attention mechanism to focus on relevant context words, leading to improved retrieval accuracy and reduced latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuroXPand over state-of-the-art expansion techniques.
