Effective task allocation is crucial in hybrid human-agent teams, where humans and autonomous agents collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper presents a decentralized auction-based mechanism for task allocation, which leverages the strengths of both humans and agents. We introduce a novel bidding strategy that incorporates agent-specific capabilities, human expertise, and temporal constraints. Our approach is evaluated through simulations and human-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating improved team performance and reduced coordination overhead compared to centralized allocation methods.
