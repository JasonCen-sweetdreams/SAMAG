Coordinating multiple agents in complex environments is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGATs), a novel deep learning approach that leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent interactions and facilitate coordination. HGATs hierarchically represent agents as nodes in a graph, enabling the capture of both local and global dependencies. We evaluate our approach in a variety of scenarios, including robot soccer and traffic management, and demonstrate significant improvements in coordination efficiency and task completion rates compared to existing methods.
