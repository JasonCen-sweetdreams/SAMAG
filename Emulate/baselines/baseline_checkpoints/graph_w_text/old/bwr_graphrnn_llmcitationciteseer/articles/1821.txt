Virtual reality (VR) has been increasingly adopted in various domains, including education, entertainment, and healthcare. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR interfaces. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR environment using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, measured through gaze tracking, heart rate, and subjective feedback. We discuss the implications of these findings on VR interface design and potential applications in fields such as therapy and education.
