Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems often struggle to retrieve relevant documents due to the complexity of medical terminology and the variability of user queries. We propose a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, which learns to generate context-aware expansion terms from a large corpus of medical texts. Our model, called MedQE, leverages a combination of word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, and attention mechanisms to identify salient terms and expand user queries. Experimental results on a benchmark MIR dataset show that MedQE significantly improves retrieval performance, outperforming traditional query expansion methods by up to 25% in terms of precision and recall.
