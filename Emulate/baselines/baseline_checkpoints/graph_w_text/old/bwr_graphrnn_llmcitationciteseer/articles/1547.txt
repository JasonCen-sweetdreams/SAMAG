Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, but the lack of interpretability in deep learning models hinders trust in their predictions. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that integrates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to provide insights into the forecasting process. Our approach learns to selectively focus on relevant segments of the input time series, enabling the identification of influential factors and improving forecasting accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HAN over state-of-the-art models, while visualization techniques facilitate understanding of the attention patterns and their correlation with forecasting performance.
