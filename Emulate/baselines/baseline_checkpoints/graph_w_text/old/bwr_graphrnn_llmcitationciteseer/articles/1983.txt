Neural search models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but they often suffer from limited query context. We propose a novel approach to query expansion using pseudo-relevance feedback, which leverages the neural model's own ranking abilities to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our method, termed 'NeuQE', iteratively refines the query representation by incorporating feedback from the model's top-ranked documents. Experimental results on the TREC Deep Learning Track dataset demonstrate that NeuQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% relative improvement in retrieval effectiveness.
