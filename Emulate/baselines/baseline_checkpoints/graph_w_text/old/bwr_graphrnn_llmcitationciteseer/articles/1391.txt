Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in various graph-based tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises concerns about their reliability in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel defense mechanism, Hierarchical Graph Pooling (HGP), which leverages the hierarchical structure of graphs to improve the robustness of GNNs against adversarial perturbations. Our method combines graph pooling with a hierarchical attention mechanism, allowing the model to focus on critical nodes and edges while diminishing the impact of perturbations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGP significantly enhances the adversarial robustness of GNNs, outperforming existing defense methods.
