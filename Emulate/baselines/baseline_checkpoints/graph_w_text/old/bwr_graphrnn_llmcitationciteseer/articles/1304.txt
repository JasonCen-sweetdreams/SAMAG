In multi-agent systems, decision-making is often a complex process involving multiple stakeholders with competing goals. While deep reinforcement learning has shown promise in this domain, it lacks interpretability, making it challenging to understand the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network architecture, 'HAN-MAD', which incorporates attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions. We demonstrate that HAN-MAD not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various multi-agent scenarios but also provides transparent and explainable decision-making processes. Our approach has significant implications for real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles and smart grids.
