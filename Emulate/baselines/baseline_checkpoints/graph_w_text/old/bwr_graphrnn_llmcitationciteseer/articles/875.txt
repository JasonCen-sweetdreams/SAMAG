Public displays are increasingly being used to provide information and services to users in various settings. However, these displays often lack adequate security measures, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access. This paper proposes a novel gaze-based implicit authentication approach using machine learning techniques. We utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze the user's gaze patterns while interacting with a public display, and achieve an accuracy of 95.6% in distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate users. Our approach is non-intrusive, user-friendly, and can be easily integrated into existing public display systems.
