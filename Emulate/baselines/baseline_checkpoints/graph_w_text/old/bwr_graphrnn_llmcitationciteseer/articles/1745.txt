Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, often relying on simplistic term matching. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroExp', which leverages neural document embeddings to better capture semantic relationships between terms. By fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on a large corpus, we generate dense vector representations of documents and queries. These embeddings are then used to expand the original query with relevant terms, improving retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and recall over traditional query expansion techniques.
