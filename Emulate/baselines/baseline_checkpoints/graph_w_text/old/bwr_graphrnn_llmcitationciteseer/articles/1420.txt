Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory study involving 20 older adults in the co-design of an inclusive voice assistant. We employed a mixed-methods approach, combining interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify barriers and opportunities for improvement. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise voice prompts, visual feedback, and error tolerance. We also propose a novel 'aging-friendly' interaction model that incorporates these insights, demonstrating improved user experience and accessibility for older adults.
