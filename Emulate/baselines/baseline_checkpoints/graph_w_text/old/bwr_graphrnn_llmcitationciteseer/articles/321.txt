Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on effective passage retrieval to provide accurate answers. However, the traditional approach of using bag-of-words representations often falls short in capturing nuanced query semantics. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion method, QDE, which generates additional context-aware terms to augment the original query. We leverage a contextualized language model to predict relevant expansion terms, which are then used to re-rank candidate passages. Experimental results on the SQuAD-Open benchmark demonstrate that QDE significantly improves passage retrieval accuracy, leading to substantial gains in end-to-end ODQA performance.
