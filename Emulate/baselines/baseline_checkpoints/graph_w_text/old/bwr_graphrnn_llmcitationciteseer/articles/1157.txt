Few-shot node classification is a challenging task in graph-structured data, where a small number of labeled examples are available for each class. We propose a Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs. HGAT consists of a hierarchical attention module that captures node importance at multiple scales, and a meta-learning framework that adapts to new classes with few examples. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, achieving up to 15% improvement in accuracy.
