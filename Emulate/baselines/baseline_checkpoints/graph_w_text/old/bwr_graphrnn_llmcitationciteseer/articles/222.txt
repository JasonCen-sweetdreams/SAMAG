Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or under-specified queries. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed EmbedExpan, uses a dense passage retrieval model to generate contextualized embeddings for query terms, which are then used to expand the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmbedExpan outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness while maintaining efficiency.
