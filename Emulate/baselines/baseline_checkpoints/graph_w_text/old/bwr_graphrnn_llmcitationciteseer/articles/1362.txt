Virtual reality (VR) systems often struggle to accurately recognize user intentions, leading to frustrating interactions. This paper presents a novel gaze-based intention recognition framework, 'GazeInt', which leverages deep learning models to predict user goals from eye movement patterns. We collect a large-scale dataset of gaze data from users performing various tasks in VR and demonstrate that GazeInt outperforms state-of-the-art models in intention recognition accuracy. Furthermore, we integrate GazeInt with a VR interface, enabling real-time intention-aware interaction and significantly improving user experience.
