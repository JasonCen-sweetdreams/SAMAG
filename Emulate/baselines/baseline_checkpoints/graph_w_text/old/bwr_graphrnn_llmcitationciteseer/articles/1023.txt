Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, facial expressions) is a challenging task due to the complexities of human emotional responses. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features, enabling more accurate and interpretable emotion recognition. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global contextual dependencies across modalities. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy and provides insights into the decision-making process through attention-based visualization.
