Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data management, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'Dexi', which leverages machine learning-based clustering to improve query performance in distributed settings. Dexi adaptively partitions the data space into a hierarchical index structure, enabling efficient query routing and reducing communication overhead. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that Dexi achieves an average query speedup of 3.5x compared to traditional indexing methods, while maintaining scalability and fault tolerance.
