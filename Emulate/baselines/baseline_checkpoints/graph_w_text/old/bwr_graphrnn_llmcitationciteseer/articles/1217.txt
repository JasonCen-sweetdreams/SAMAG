Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it aims to refine the initial query to better capture the user's information need. While traditional methods rely on term co-occurrence and statistical analysis, we propose a novel approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic query representations. Our method, dubbed DeepQE, uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to weigh the importance of expansion terms and generates a more accurate and diverse set of expanded queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and robustness over state-of-the-art methods.
