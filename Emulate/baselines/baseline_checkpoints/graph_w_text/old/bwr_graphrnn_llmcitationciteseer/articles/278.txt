Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query plans in distributed environments. We introduce a query embedding model that captures query semantics and a graph neural network that predicts optimal query plans based on database statistics and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
