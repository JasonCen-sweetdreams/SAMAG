State-of-the-art neural ranking models for ad-hoc retrieval often fail to scale to large document collections due to their high computational complexity. We propose a hierarchical neural embedding framework, 'HierDoc', which learns to represent documents at multiple granularities, from individual terms to entire documents. By leveraging these hierarchical representations, HierDoc reduces the number of required pairwise comparisons during retrieval, resulting in significant speedups while maintaining retrieval accuracy. Our experiments on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that HierDoc outperforms existing neural ranking models in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.
