Time-series forecasting has become crucial in various domains, but the lack of interpretability in modern deep learning models hinders trust in their predictions. This paper introduces Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs), a novel architecture that exploits both local and global patterns in multivariate time-series data. By incorporating hierarchical attention mechanisms, HANs provide transparent insights into the contribution of each input feature and time step to the forecast. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HANs in improving forecasting accuracy while facilitating explainability through visualizations of attention weights.
