In complex multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation and real-time communication are crucial for success. This paper introduces a decentralized autonomous agent communication framework, DACOM, which leverages blockchain and smart contracts to enable secure, peer-to-peer task negotiation. DACOM's novel consensus algorithm, AgentChain, ensures that agents can dynamically allocate tasks while maintaining system-wide consistency and scalability. Experimental results on a realistic logistics scenario demonstrate DACOM's ability to reduce task latency by up to 40% compared to traditional centralized approaches.
