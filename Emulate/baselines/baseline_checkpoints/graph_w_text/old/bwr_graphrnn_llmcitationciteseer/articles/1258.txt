Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features to improve emotion recognition. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to model inter-modal and intra-modal relationships, enabling the model to provide interpretable explanations for its predictions. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in achieving state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal emotion recognition tasks.
