Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to detect anomalies in time-series data. Our approach enables the identification of relevant features and time intervals contributing to the anomaly, providing explainability and insights into the detection process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while offering improved interpretability over existing methods.
