This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to designing adaptive gesture recognition systems for older adults. We propose a novel framework that incorporates user modeling, gesture recognition, and adaptive feedback to improve the accuracy and usability of gesture-based interfaces for older adults. Our approach uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to learn users' gesture patterns and adapt to their changing abilities over time. We evaluate our framework using a dataset of gestures collected from older adults and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction.
