Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for storing and processing large amounts of data. However, sharing data across multiple sites while ensuring security and scalability remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'SecureShare', which leverages a combination of data fragmentation, encryption, and access control to enable secure and efficient data sharing in distributed database systems. Our approach ensures that data is protected both in transit and at rest, while minimizing the overhead of encryption and decryption. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of SecureShare in comparison to existing approaches.
