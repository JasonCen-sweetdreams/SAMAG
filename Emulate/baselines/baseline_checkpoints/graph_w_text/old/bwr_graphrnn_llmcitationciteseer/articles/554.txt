Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach that leverages a two-stage retrieval process. The first stage uses a coarse-grained dense retriever to select top-k passages, which are then re-ranked using a fine-grained dense retriever. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR achieves significant improvements in retrieval quality and efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, reducing the latency by 3.5x while maintaining similar top-20 accuracy.
