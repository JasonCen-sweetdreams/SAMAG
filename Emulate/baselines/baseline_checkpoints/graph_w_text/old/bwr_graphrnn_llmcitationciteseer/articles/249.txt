Search result diversification is a critical component of modern information retrieval systems, as it directly impacts user satisfaction. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using hierarchical topic modeling, which captures nuanced relationships between query terms and documents. Our method, dubbed 'HTM-QE', leverages a Bayesian hierarchical Dirichlet process to model topic hierarchies and generate diversified query expansions. Experimental results on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search result diversification, precision, and recall compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
