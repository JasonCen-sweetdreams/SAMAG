This paper presents a novel approach to document retrieval that combines hierarchical K-means clustering with query expansion. Our proposed method, Hierarchical Query Expansion (HQE), iteratively refines the search space by applying K-means clustering to a set of preliminary results, and then expands the query using relevant terms from the centroids of the resulting clusters. We demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall. Our experiments also show that HQE is particularly effective for handling noisy or ambiguous queries, and can be easily integrated with existing retrieval models.
