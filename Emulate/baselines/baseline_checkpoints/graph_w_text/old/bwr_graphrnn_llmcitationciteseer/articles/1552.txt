Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) has become increasingly important for timely business decision-making. However, optimizing queries in RTDW systems remains a major challenge due to the complex and dynamic nature of the data and queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to dynamic query optimization using machine learning. We develop a predictive model that leverages query patterns, data distribution, and system workload to optimize query execution plans. Our approach is adaptive, scalable, and robust, and experimental results on a real-world RTDW system show significant performance improvements over traditional optimization techniques.
