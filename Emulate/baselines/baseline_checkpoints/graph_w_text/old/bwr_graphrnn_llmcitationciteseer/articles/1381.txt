Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or incomplete queries. We propose a novel query expansion framework, 'DeepQERL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize the query expansion process. Our approach learns to select the most informative terms to add to the original query, while minimizing the risk of query drift. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQERL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
