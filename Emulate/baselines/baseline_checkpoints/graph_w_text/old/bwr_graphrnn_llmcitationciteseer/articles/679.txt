Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We developed an avatar customization system that incorporates users' physical characteristics, personality traits, and preferences. Our user study with 120 participants demonstrates that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, sense of presence, and overall satisfaction in VR applications. We also provide insights into the design considerations for effective avatar customization and discuss the implications for VR-based domains such as education, healthcare, and entertainment.
