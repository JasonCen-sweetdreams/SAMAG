Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it aims to reformulate the user's query to better capture their information need. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'SemExpan', utilizes a neural network to learn dense vector representations of query terms and their contexts, which are then used to identify relevant expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemExpan significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving higher retrieval accuracy and improved robustness to query ambiguity.
