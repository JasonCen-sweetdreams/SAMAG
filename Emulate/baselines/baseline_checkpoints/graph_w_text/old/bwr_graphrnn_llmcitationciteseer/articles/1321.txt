Query expansion is a crucial step in text retrieval, but existing methods often ignore the contextual relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'CAQE', which leverages context-aware embeddings to capture the nuances of query semantics. Our method incorporates a graph-based attention mechanism to model the interactions between query terms and their contextual neighbors. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
