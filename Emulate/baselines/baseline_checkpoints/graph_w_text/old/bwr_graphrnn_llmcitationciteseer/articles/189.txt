Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but they pose significant challenges in query optimization. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization that leverages tenant-specific workload characteristics and resource utilization patterns. Our proposed framework, 'MTQO', employs a hierarchical optimization strategy that combines machine learning-based prediction models with traditional query optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database system demonstrate that MTQO achieves an average query performance improvement of 30% compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
