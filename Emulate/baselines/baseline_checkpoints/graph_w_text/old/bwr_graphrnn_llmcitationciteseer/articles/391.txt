Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used to manage large-scale datasets. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a challenging task due to the complexity of query execution plans and data distribution. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to optimize query performance in DDS. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to select the optimal query execution plan based on the query workload, data distribution, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
