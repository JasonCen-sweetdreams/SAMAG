Gesture-based interaction has become increasingly prevalent in modern computing, but its adoption by older adults with cognitive impairments is hindered by the complexity of existing systems. This paper presents 'EasyGest', a novel gesture recognition framework designed to accommodate the needs of this population. EasyGest incorporates a probabilistic model of gesture execution, which enables real-time adaptation to individual motor skill abilities. We evaluated EasyGest with 20 older adults and found significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems. Our findings inform the design of more accessible and inclusive gesture-based interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments.
