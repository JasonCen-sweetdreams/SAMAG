Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the varying importance of different modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features for emotion recognition. Our approach leverages a bottom-up attention mechanism to identify salient features within each modality and a top-down attention mechanism to weigh the importance of each modality. Experimental results on the multimodal IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our HAN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of emotion recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.
