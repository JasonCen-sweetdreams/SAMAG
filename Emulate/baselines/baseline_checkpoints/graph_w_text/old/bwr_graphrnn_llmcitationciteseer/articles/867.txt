Despite the success of deep learning-based recommendation systems, their lack of transparency and interpretability hinders their widespread adoption. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that incorporates both item-level and user-level graph structures to provide personalized recommendations. We propose a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes recommendation performance and explanation quality, enabling the model to generate intuitive and interpretable explanations for its recommendations. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and transparency.
