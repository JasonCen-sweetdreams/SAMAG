Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of daily life, but users with visual impairments often face significant barriers to accessibility. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual impairments. We introduce a set of guidelines and tools for developers to create accessible VR interactions, leveraging audio-based navigation, haptic feedback, and assistive AI-driven narration. A user study with participants with visual impairments demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing their VR experience and overall satisfaction.
