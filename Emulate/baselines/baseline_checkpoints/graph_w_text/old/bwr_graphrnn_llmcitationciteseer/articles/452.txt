This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural ranking model (HNRM) for efficient document retrieval in large-scale information retrieval systems. HNRM leverages a multi-level attention mechanism to capture both local and global semantic relationships between query and document terms. Our experiments on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that HNRM outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of both retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency. We also show that HNRM can be effectively applied to various IR tasks, including passage retrieval and question answering.
