Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and high concurrency. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database system and observing the execution times. Our approach considers various factors such as data distribution, query patterns, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time.
