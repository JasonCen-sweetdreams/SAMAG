Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for explainable time series anomaly detection. HAN leverages a hierarchical architecture to capture both local and global patterns in time series data, and incorporates attention mechanisms to highlight the most relevant features contributing to anomaly detection. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while providing insightful explanations.
