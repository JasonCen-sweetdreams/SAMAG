Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis, but it becomes increasingly challenging when dealing with high-dimensional data. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'NeuroHier', which leverages the representation learning capabilities of deep neural networks to improve clustering performance. By integrating a hierarchical clustering algorithm with a deep autoencoder, NeuroHier can capture complex patterns and relationships in high-dimensional data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroHier outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods in terms of clustering quality and scalability.
