This paper proposes a novel approach to distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. We introduce a decentralized algorithm that allows agents to learn task assignment policies through interactions with their environment. Our method, called 'RL-TA', leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and a multi-agent Q-learning framework to optimize task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that RL-TA outperforms traditional allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utility.
