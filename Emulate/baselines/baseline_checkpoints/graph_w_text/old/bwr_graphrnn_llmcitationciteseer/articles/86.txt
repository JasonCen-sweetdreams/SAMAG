Distributed information retrieval systems face the challenge of efficiently querying large document collections across multiple machines. This paper presents a novel approach to improve query efficiency by leveraging hierarchical document clustering. We propose a clustering algorithm that groups documents based on their semantic similarity and distributes them across machines. Our experiments on a large-scale dataset show that our approach reduces query latency by up to 30% compared to traditional term-partitioning methods, while maintaining retrieval effectiveness.
