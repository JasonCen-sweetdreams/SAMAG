Gaze-based interaction has shown promise for intuitive human-computer interaction, but suffers from limitations in accuracy and latency. We propose EyeGaze+, a novel framework that leverages machine learning-driven eye movement prediction to enhance gaze-based interaction. Our approach incorporates a deep neural network that predicts user gaze targets based on historical gaze patterns, allowing for more accurate and timely gaze estimation. We evaluate EyeGaze+ on a dataset of 30 participants and demonstrate significant improvements in gaze estimation accuracy, reducing latency by up to 30% compared to traditional gaze-tracking methods.
