Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query formulations. We propose a novel query expansion framework, 'DeepQER', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to dynamically refine queries based on user feedback. Our approach incorporates a neural network-based policy that learns to select optimal expansion terms from a large vocabulary, taking into account both semantic relevance and retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc benchmark demonstrate that DeepQER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
