Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train an agent to learn an optimal policy for selecting the best execution plan. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
