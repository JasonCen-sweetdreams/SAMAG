Distributed database systems (DDS) face the challenge of optimizing queries to minimize response time and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans in DDS. We design a customized RL framework that learns to adapt to diverse query workloads, database schemas, and system configurations. Experimental results on a realistic DDS setup demonstrate that our RL-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers, achieving an average reduction of 30% in query response time and 25% in resource utilization.
