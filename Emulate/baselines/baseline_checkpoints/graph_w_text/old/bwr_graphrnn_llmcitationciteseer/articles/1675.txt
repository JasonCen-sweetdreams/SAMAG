Distributed information retrieval systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern search engines, but they often suffer from slow query response times due to the need to aggregate results from multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HierIndex', which leverages a tree-based structure to expedite query processing. By partitioning the index into smaller, node-specific sub-indexes and employing a lazy aggregation strategy, HierIndex reduces the average query latency by up to 35% compared to traditional inverted indexing methods. Experimental results on a large-scale Web dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HierIndex in improving query efficiency while maintaining retrieval accuracy.
