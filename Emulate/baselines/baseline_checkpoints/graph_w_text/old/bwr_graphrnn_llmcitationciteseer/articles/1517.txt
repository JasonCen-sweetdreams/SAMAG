Explainable recommendation systems have garnered significant attention in recent years, as they provide users with insights into the reasoning behind suggested items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework, which models user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph structure. HGAT leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant item features and user preferences, generating personalized explanations for top-N recommended items. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.
