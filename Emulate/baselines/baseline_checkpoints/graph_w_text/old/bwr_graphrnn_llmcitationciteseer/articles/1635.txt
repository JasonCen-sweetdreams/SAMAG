This paper investigates the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the role of gesture-based interaction in enhancing cognitive processes. We designed an immersive VR experience that incorporates hand-tracking technology and motion sensors to analyze the effects of embodied interaction on spatial reasoning and problem-solving tasks. Our study reveals significant improvements in cognitive performance and user engagement when compared to traditional keyboard-and-mouse interfaces. The findings have implications for the design of future VR systems, highlighting the importance of incorporating embodied cognition principles to create more intuitive and effective human-computer interfaces.
