Columnar storage has emerged as a promising solution for big data analytics, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization for multi-dimensional indexing in columnar storage, leveraging a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques. Our proposed method, ' QuickOpt', efficiently identifies the most informative columns and optimizes query plans to minimize data retrieval and processing costs. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that QuickOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
