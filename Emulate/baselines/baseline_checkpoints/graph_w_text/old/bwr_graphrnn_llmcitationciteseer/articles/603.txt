Event extraction is a crucial task in natural language processing, but existing approaches often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) architecture that integrates graph-based modeling with attention mechanisms to extract events from textual data. HAGNN leverages syntactic and semantic dependencies to capture complex event relationships and assigns attention weights to identify key entities and triggers. Experimental results on the ACE2005 dataset demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art models in event extraction while providing visualizable explanations for its predictions.
