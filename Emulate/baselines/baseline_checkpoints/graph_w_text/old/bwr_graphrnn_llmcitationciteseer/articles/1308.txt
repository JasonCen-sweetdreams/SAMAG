Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important in today's fast-paced business environment. However, optimizing queries for low latency and high throughput remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization technique that leverages column-store indexing to improve query performance. Our approach, called 'CSI-Optimizer', uses a cost-based optimization framework to selectively apply column-store indexing to frequently accessed data columns. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that CSI-Optimizer reduces query latency by up to 3x and improves throughput by up to 2x compared to traditional row-store indexing.
