This paper presents a novel framework for autonomous negotiation in multi-agent systems, enabling agents to adapt to dynamic environments and negotiate effectively with uncertain or changing opponent preferences. We introduce a hybrid approach combining machine learning and game-theoretic models to learn negotiation strategies that balance individual and collective utility. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios, including supply chain management and resource allocation. The proposed framework has applications in real-world domains such as smart cities, e-commerce, and robotics.
