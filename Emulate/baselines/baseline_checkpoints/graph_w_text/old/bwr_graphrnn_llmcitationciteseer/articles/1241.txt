E-commerce search engines often struggle to capture user intent, leading to irrelevant results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) to identify relevant product features and opinions. Our method, called AspectQA, extracts aspect-sentiment pairs from product reviews and incorporates them into the query expansion process. We evaluate AspectQA on a large e-commerce dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in search accuracy and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
