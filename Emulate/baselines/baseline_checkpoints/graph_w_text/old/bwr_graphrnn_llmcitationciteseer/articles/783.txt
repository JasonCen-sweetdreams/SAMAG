Short-text collections, such as social media and news archives, pose significant challenges to information retrieval systems due to the limited context and ambiguity of query terms. This paper proposes a query-driven document expansion approach, QDE, which selectively incorporates relevant contextual information from external knowledge bases to augment the representation of short documents. Our method leverages a neural ranking model to estimate the relevance of expansion terms and integrates them into the document index. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QDE significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries with low term frequency, and outperforms state-of-the-art expansion techniques.
