This paper presents a novel approach to gaze-based user authentication for augmented reality (AR) systems using deep learning. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that learns to recognize the unique patterns of eye movements when users gaze at specific locations in the AR environment. Our approach leverages the high-resolution eye-tracking data available in modern AR head-mounted displays to improve the security and usability of authentication. Experimental results on a dataset of 50 participants show that our method achieves an authentication accuracy of 95.6% and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
