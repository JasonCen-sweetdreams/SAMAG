In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, existing methods often rely on centralized controllers or simplified assumptions about agent behavior. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'Hierarchical-RL', which leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn and adapt in complex, dynamic environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Hierarchical-RL in a variety of scenarios, including search and rescue, resource allocation, and traffic management, and show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion efficiency and robustness to agent failures.
