The increasing size of document collections in modern information retrieval (IR) systems poses significant challenges for efficient document retrieval. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'DocRank', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture complex document relationships. We demonstrate that DocRank outperforms traditional ranking models, such as BM25 and TF-IDF, in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we show that DocRank can be seamlessly integrated into large-scale IR systems, enabling real-time document retrieval at scale.
