Time-series forecasting models often prioritize accuracy over interpretability, making it challenging to understand their predictions. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates explainability into the forecasting process. Our model employs a dual-attention mechanism, focusing on both local and global patterns in the time-series data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN on several real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing transparent and actionable insights into the forecasting process.
