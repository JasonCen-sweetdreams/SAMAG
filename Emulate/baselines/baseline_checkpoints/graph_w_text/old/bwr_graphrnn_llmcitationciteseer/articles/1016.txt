Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to the need for transparency in decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture for explainable recommendation systems. HGAT leverages the graph structure of user-item interactions to capture complex relationships and attends to the most relevant nodes at multiple levels of granularity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on several real-world datasets, showcasing improved recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we provide insights into the learned attention patterns, offering a deeper understanding of the recommendation process.
