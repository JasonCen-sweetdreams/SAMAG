Traditional indexing techniques often struggle to keep up with the increasing complexity of modern datasets. This paper proposes a novel deep learned index structure, dubbed 'DeepIX', which leverages neural networks to learn the underlying data distribution. By incorporating a self-organizing mechanism, DeepIX adaptively adjusts its indexing strategy to optimize query performance. Experimental results on various real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in query latency and throughput compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques, while maintaining competitive storage efficiency.
