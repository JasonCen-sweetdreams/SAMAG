Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel heuristics-based approach for join reordering in distributed query optimization. Our method leverages statistical analysis of query patterns and data distribution to predict the most efficient join order, resulting in significant performance improvements. We evaluate our approach using the TPC-DS benchmark and demonstrate an average query speedup of 2.5x compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
