Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query execution plan. Our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of execution time and resource utilization. We evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving query performance.
