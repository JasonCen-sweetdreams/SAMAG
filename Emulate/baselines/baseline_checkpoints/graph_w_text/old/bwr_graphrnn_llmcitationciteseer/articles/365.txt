This paper addresses the problem of decentralized task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have varying capabilities and communication constraints. We propose a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a distributed task allocation policy. Our method, called GNN-TA, leverages the graph structure of the agent network to encode agent relationships and task dependencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-TA through simulations on a variety of task allocation scenarios, showing improved performance and scalability compared to existing decentralized algorithms.
