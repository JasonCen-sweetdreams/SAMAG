In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient assignment of tasks to agents to maximize overall system performance. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep graph reinforcement learning to learn task allocation policies. We model the task allocation problem as a graph, where agents and tasks are nodes, and edges represent task dependencies. Our approach, called Graph-TA, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal task allocation policy by minimizing a reward function that captures task dependencies and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated robotics domain show that Graph-TA outperforms state-of-the-art task allocation algorithms in terms of system performance and adaptability to changing task requirements.
