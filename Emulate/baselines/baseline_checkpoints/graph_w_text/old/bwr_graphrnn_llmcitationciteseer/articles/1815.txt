Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus and ranking them to answer a question. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural ranking model, HiNR, which leverages a two-stage retrieval approach to improve passage retrieval efficiency. HiNR first uses a coarse-grained retriever to select top-k passages and then employs a fine-grained ranker to re-rank the passages using a hierarchical interaction mechanism. Experiments on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that HiNR achieves state-of-the-art results while reducing the computational cost of passage retrieval by 30%
