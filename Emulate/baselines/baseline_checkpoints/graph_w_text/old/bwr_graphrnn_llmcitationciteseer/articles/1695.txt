The ever-growing volume of digital documents necessitates efficient and accurate information retrieval systems. This paper introduces a novel hybrid retrieval model, 'HRM', which combines the strengths of lexical and semantic matching techniques. HRM utilizes a neural network-based semantic embedding module to capture nuanced document relationships, while incorporating a lightweight lexical matching component to reduce computational overhead. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HRM achieves significant improvements in document ranking efficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, making it a promising solution for large-scale IR applications.
