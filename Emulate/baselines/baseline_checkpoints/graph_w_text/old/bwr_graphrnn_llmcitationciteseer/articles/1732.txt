Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems to improve search accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep learning-based word embeddings. We leverage pre-trained word2vec models to generate semantically similar terms for query expansion. Our approach, dubbed 'DeepQE', outperforms traditional methods such as Rocchio's algorithm and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) on several benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepQE in combination with traditional IR models, leading to significant improvements in mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) metrics.
