In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'GAT-Task', which leverages graph attention networks to learn task representations and allocate tasks to agents. Our approach incorporates agent capabilities, task dependencies, and communication constraints to optimize task assignments. Experimental results on a real-world disaster response scenario demonstrate that GAT-Task outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
