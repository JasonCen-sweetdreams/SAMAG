Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a fundamental task in natural language processing that involves identifying sentiment towards specific aspects or entities in text. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome, hand-crafted feature engineering or simplistic graph neural networks. This paper proposes Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT) for efficient document representation in ABSA. HGAT leverages a novel hierarchical graph structure to capture long-range dependencies and aspect interactions, while attention mechanisms focus on relevant contextual information. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art methods in terms of aspect-level sentiment accuracy and computational efficiency.
