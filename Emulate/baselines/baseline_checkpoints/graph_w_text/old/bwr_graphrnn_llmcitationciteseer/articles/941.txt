This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, where agents bid for tasks using auctions. We propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to optimize the bidding strategy, taking into account the agents' capabilities, task requirements, and temporal constraints. Our approach enables agents to adapt to changing task demands and improves overall system efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and reduces communication overhead.
