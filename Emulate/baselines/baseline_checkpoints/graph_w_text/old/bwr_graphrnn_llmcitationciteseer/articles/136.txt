Query optimization is a crucial component in distributed database systems, as it significantly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, dubbed 'RL-Optimizer', leverages the Markov decision process framework to model the query optimization problem and learns to select optimal query plans through trial and error. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
