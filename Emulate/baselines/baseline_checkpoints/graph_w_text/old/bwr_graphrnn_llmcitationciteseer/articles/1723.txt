Human-robot collaboration (HRC) has the potential to revolutionize manufacturing and service industries. However, existing HRC systems often rely on pre-programmed instructions or manual intervention, limiting their adaptability and efficiency. This paper presents a novel framework for real-time HRC using reinforcement learning (RL) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Our approach learns to predict human intentions and adjust robot actions accordingly, ensuring seamless collaboration and task completion. We evaluate our framework on a real-world assembly task and demonstrate significant improvements in task efficiency and human satisfaction compared to traditional HRC methods.
