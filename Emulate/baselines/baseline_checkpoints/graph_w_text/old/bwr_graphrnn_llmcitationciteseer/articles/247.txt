Explainability is crucial in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for real-world applications. This paper introduces Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) to facilitate explainable MARL. HANs learn to focus on relevant agents and their interactions, enabling the identification of key decision-making factors. Our approach outperforms existing MARL methods on two complex scenarios: autonomous vehicle control and robotic soccer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HANs in providing insights into agent behavior, improving overall system transparency and accountability.
