The proliferation of IoT devices has generated an enormous amount of sensor data, posing significant challenges for real-time analytics. Existing indexing techniques are often inefficient, leading to high latency and poor query performance. This paper introduces a novel indexing framework, 'IoT-Index', which leverages a combination of Bloom filters, hash tables, and bit-vector compression to enable fast and efficient querying of IoT sensor data. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that IoT-Index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time and 5x in storage efficiency.
