In-memory database systems (IMDS) have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics and transactional workloads. However, traditional indexing techniques are often suboptimal for IMDS due to skewed data distributions. This paper proposes a novel skew-tolerant hashing scheme, 'STASH', which adaptively adjusts the hash function to minimize collisions and optimize query performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of STASH through extensive experiments on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing significant improvements in query latency and throughput compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
