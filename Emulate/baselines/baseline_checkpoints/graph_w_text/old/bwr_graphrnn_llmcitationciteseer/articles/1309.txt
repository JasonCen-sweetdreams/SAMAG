Materialized views are a crucial performance optimization technique in databases, but their maintenance becomes increasingly complex in distributed settings. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DynaView', which leverages incremental view maintenance and adaptive data partitioning to minimize the overhead of view updates. Our experiments on a distributed database cluster demonstrate that DynaView reduces view maintenance time by up to 75% compared to traditional recomputation-based methods, while ensuring data consistency and freshness.
