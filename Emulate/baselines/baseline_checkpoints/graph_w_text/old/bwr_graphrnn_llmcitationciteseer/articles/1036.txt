Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of each modality to improve emotion recognition. Our HAN model employs a hierarchical structure to aggregate features from multiple modalities, and a attention mechanism to selectively focus on the most informative regions. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and SEMAINE datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of emotion recognition accuracy and robustness.
