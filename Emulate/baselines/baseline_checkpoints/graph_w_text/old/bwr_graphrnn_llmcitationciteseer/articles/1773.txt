Recommender systems often rely on complex models that are difficult to interpret, limiting their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) framework for explainable recommendation. HGAN integrates item relationships and user preferences into a hierarchical graph structure, allowing for attention-based filtering and interpretable recommendation explanations. We evaluate HGAN on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved recommendation accuracy and enhanced model interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
