As data scales, distributed database systems face significant performance bottlenecks due to suboptimal query optimization. This paper presents GQO, a novel graph-based indexing approach that reduces query latency by up to 60% in distributed database systems. GQO leverages graph theory to model data relationships and optimize query plans, eliminating redundant joins and minimizing data transfer. We evaluate GQO using the TPC-C benchmark on a distributed PostgreSQL cluster, demonstrating improved performance and scalability compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
