In multi-agent systems, understanding the decision-making process is crucial for trust and reliability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision making. Our approach captures complex interactions between agents and environment states, generating attention weights that highlight influential factors in the decision-making process. We evaluate our model on a simulated urban traffic control scenario, demonstrating improved explainability and decision quality compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
