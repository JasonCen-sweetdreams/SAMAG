Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing interfaces often exacerbate cognitive load and frustration. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyVR', a novel VR interface tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. Our design incorporates simplicity, consistency, and multisensory feedback to reduce cognitive burden. A user study with 20 participants aged 65-85 showed significant improvements in task completion time, error rate, and user satisfaction compared to a standard VR interface. Our findings inform the development of inclusive VR experiences that can promote cognitive accessibility and independence for older adults.
