Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a neural query expansion (NQE) framework that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our approach incorporates a novel attention mechanism to weigh the importance of expanded terms and a hierarchical clustering module to identify informative document snippets. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that NQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques in terms of precision and recall, with average gains of 15.2% and 12.5%, respectively.
