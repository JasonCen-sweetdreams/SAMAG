Ad-hoc information retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent from short, ambiguous queries. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select expansion terms. Our approach, 'RL-QE', uses a Markov decision process to model the query expansion process, and trains a policy network to optimize the expected retrieval performance. We evaluate RL-QE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art expansion methods.
