As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need to understand how humans interact with robots in these virtual environments. This paper explores the concept of embodiment in human-robot collaboration, where humans and robots jointly perform tasks in VR. We conducted a user study to investigate the effects of embodiment on collaboration outcomes, trust, and user experience. Our results show that embodied robots can significantly improve collaboration efficiency and user satisfaction, but also introduce new challenges related to spatial awareness and communication. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future human-robot collaboration systems in VR.
