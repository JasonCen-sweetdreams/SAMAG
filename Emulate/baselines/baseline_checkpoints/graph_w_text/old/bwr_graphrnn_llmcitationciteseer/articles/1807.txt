Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, but traditional methods often rely on manual parameter tuning and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes an adaptive query expansion framework that leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn semantic query representations. Our approach dynamically adjusts the query expansion parameters based on the query context and document collection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in recall and precision.
