Distributed database systems face significant performance challenges when handling multi-dimensional range queries. Existing indexing techniques struggle to balance storage overhead, query latency, and data distribution. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, 'Dexi', which leverages a hybrid combination of grid-based and tree-based indexing to efficiently process range queries on distributed data. Dexi adaptively partitions the data space to minimize storage overhead and optimizes query routing to reduce latency. Experimental results demonstrate that Dexi outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of storage efficiency.
