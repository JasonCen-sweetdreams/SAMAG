Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant texts from a large corpus. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach that leverages a two-stage architecture to prune irrelevant passages. We introduce a sparse-dense attention mechanism that adaptively weights passage representations based on lexical and semantic similarities. Experimental results on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that HDR achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and end-to-end QA accuracy compared to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods.
