Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has achieved state-of-the-art results in various information retrieval tasks. However, existing DPR models often fail to capture the hierarchical context of a query, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to enriching query representations by integrating hierarchical context using a graph-based attention mechanism. Our method, HierDPR, learns to represent queries as a hierarchical graph, where nodes correspond to query terms and edges capture semantic relationships. We experimentally demonstrate that HierDPR outperforms existing DPR models on several benchmark datasets, including MS MARCO and Natural Questions.
