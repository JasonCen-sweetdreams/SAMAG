Anomaly detection in time series data streams is a crucial task in many applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'TS-ADNet', which leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to efficiently detect anomalies in real-time. TS-ADNet incorporates a sliding window mechanism to process streaming data and employs a density-based clustering algorithm to identify anomalies. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-ADNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and computational efficiency.
