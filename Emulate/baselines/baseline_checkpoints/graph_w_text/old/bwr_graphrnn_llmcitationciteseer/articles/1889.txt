Resource allocation in cloud computing is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for autonomous resource allocation, which learns to optimize resource utilization and minimize costs. Our approach leverages a novel combination of a deep Q-network and a generative adversarial network to learn a resource allocation policy that adapts to dynamic workload patterns. Experimental results on a real-world cloud computing dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic methods in terms of resource utilization and cost savings.
