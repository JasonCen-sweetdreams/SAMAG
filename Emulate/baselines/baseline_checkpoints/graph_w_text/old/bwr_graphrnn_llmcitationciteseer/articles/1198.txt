Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a powerful technique to improve retrieval performance, but it is often computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using reinforcement learning, where the agent learns to select the most informative terms to add to the query. We formulate the query expansion problem as a Markov decision process and use deep Q-networks to learn the policy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
