Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, but its effectiveness is often limited by the quality of the expansion terms. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal query expansion strategies. Our method, 'DeepQE', uses a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to select the most informative expansion terms that maximize the expected retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
