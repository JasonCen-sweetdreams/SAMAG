Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-structured data, where a model must adapt to novel classes with limited labeled examples. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical graph representations and attention mechanisms to effectively capture node relationships. HGAT learns to selectively focus on relevant subgraphs and adapt to new classes via meta-learning. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, achieving a 12% improvement in accuracy on the challenging PPI dataset.
