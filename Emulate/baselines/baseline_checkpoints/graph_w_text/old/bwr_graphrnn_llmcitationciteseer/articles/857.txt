Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and high concurrency. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. Our approach, called QOpt, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan from a large state space. We evaluate QOpt on a real-world dataset and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time.
