Passage retrieval has become increasingly important in modern information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel context-aware document expansion approach, CADE, which leverages query-oriented passage retrieval to improve the retrieval effectiveness. CADE expands the original document by incorporating relevant passages from related documents, taking into account the query context and passage semantics. We evaluate CADE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in recall and precision over state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods.
