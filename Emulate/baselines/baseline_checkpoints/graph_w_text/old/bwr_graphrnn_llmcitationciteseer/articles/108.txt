Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, but the effectiveness of traditional methods is limited by their reliance on manual feature engineering and heuristics. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to adaptively select expansion terms. Our proposed framework, 'RL-Expander', utilizes a hierarchical DQN to balance exploration and exploitation in the term selection process. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-Expander outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness.
