Transformer-based models have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but their quadratic computational complexity hinders deployment on resource-constrained devices. This paper proposes a novel attention mechanism, 'Hierarchical Adaptive Attention' (HAA), which reduces the computational overhead by 30% while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on popular NLP benchmarks. HAA adaptively allocates attention weights based on the input sequence's structural complexity, effectively exploiting the hierarchical nature of language. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of HAA in real-world NLP applications, such as sentiment analysis and machine translation.
