As big data analytics continues to grow, query optimization becomes a critical bottleneck. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. Our method, 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given workload. We evaluate RL-Opt on a suite of benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
