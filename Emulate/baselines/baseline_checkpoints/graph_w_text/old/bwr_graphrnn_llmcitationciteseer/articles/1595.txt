Conversational search systems aim to facilitate more natural and interactive search experiences. However, they often struggle to accurately capture user intent, especially when queries are ambiguous or under-specified. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'DeepQR', which leverages hierarchical attention networks to reformulate user queries and improve search result relevance. Our method learns to selectively attend to different query components and identify relevant context from previous interactions. Experimental results on a large conversational search dataset demonstrate that DeepQR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query reformulation techniques, achieving a 23% increase in search result relevance.
