Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem in many real-world applications, but existing methods often struggle to balance accuracy and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical gradient boosting framework, 'HGBT', that leverages the strengths of both tree-based models and gradient boosting machines. HGBT recursively partitions the time series data into hierarchical segments, applying gradient boosting at each level to capture complex patterns and trends. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGBT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results while providing transparent and interpretable insights into the forecasting process.
