Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems generate vast amounts of heterogeneous data, making anomaly detection a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network-based approach, 'HGNAD', which leverages the inherent structural and semantic relationships between IIoT devices. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weights node features and edge types, allowing the model to capture complex patterns and correlations. Experimental results on a real-world IIoT dataset demonstrate that HGNAD outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, achieving an F1-score of 0.93 and reducing false positives by 35%.
