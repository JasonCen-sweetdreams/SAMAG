Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to detect anomalies in time series data. Our approach provides transparent insights into the anomaly detection process, enabling identification of key contributing factors. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms existing methods while offering improved explainability.
