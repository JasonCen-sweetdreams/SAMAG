Distributed column-store databases have gained popularity for their ability to handle large-scale analytics workloads. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay of data distribution, storage layout, and query execution plans. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'Columbo', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and dynamic reordering of query operators to minimize query latency. Experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that Columbo achieves an average speedup of 2.5x over state-of-the-art query optimizers for complex analytical queries.
