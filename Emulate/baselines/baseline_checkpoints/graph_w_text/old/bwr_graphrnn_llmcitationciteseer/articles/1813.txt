Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to improve the retrieval effectiveness by adding relevant terms to the original query. In this paper, we propose a novel QE approach, Neural Query Graph Embeddings (NQGE), which leverages the power of graph neural networks to model the complex relationships between query terms and documents. NQGE learns a dense representation of the query graph, capturing both local and global semantic patterns. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that NQGE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness.
