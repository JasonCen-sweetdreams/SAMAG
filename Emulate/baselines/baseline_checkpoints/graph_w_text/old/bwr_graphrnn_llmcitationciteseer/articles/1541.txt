Decentralized task allocation is a crucial challenge in multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents must coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'RL-TAA', that leverages reinforcement learning to enable decentralized task allocation among autonomous agents. RL-TAA uses a decentralized Q-network to learn task allocations that maximize rewards, while considering agent capabilities, task dependencies, and communication constraints. We evaluate RL-TAA on a variety of tasks and show significant improvements in task completion rates and resource utilization compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
