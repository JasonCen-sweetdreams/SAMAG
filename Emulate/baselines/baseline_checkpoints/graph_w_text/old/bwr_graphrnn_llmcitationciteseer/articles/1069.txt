In multi-agent systems, decision-making often involves complex interactions between agents with varying levels of autonomy. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable decision-making in multi-agent settings. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to identify influential agents and their interactions, providing transparent and interpretable decision-making processes. We evaluate our HAN model on a simulated autonomous vehicle fleet management scenario, demonstrating improved decision-making performance and enhanced explainability compared to existing methods.
