Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing query performance for multiple tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal query plans based on workload characteristics and system resources. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional cost-based optimization methods by up to 30% in terms of query latency, while reducing resource utilization by 25%. We also demonstrate the applicability of our approach to various tenant workloads and database sizes.
