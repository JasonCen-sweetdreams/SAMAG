This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging auction-based mechanisms to facilitate efficient and fair task assignment. Our approach, dubbed 'AuctionMAS', enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences, while a central auctioneer allocates tasks to minimize overall system latency. We prove the convergence and optimality of AuctionMAS under various task and agent distributions, and demonstrate its effectiveness through simulations on a realistic logistics domain.
