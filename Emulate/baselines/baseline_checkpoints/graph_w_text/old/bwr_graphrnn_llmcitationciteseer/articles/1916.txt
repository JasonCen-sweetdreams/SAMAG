Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, but traditional QE methods often rely on manual feature engineering and term weighting schemes. This paper proposes a novel QE approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic query representations. Our model, called DeepQE, uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural layers to capture term dependencies and contextual information. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing computational overhead.
