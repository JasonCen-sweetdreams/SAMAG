Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to autonomously decide on tasks to execute without a central authority. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a distributed task allocation policy. Our method, called GNN-TA, represents the agent-task graph as a dynamic graph and uses GNNs to learn a task allocation strategy that minimizes global cost and maximizes system efficiency. We evaluate GNN-TA on a series of benchmark problems and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling complex task dependencies and agent interactions.
