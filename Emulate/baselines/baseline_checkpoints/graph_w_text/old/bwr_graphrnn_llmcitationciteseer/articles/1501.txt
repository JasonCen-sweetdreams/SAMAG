Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our HAN model incorporates a multi-scale attention mechanism that learns to focus on relevant temporal segments and features, thereby providing insights into the anomaly detection process. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved detection performance and interpretability compared to existing methods.
