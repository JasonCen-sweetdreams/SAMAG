Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed and implemented a novel avatar personalization framework that incorporates user preferences, personality traits, and physical characteristics. Our user study with 120 participants shows that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, sense of presence, and overall satisfaction in VR applications. We also explore the impact of avatar personalization on user behavior and identify key factors that influence user experience.
