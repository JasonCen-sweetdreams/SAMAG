Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability and accessibility for older adults remain limited. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, tailored to the needs and abilities of older adults. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our prototype, 'ElderVoice', incorporates intuitive voice commands, personalized feedback, and visual cues to enhance user experience and confidence. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
