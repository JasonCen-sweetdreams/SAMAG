Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when limited annotated data is available. We propose a hierarchical neural ranking model, HNR, that leverages weak supervision from user behavior data to improve retrieval performance. HNR combines a neural ranking module with a hierarchical clustering component to capture complex document relationships. We evaluate HNR on several benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in terms of NDCG and MAP metrics. Our approach has implications for developing more effective and scalable search engines.
