This paper explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user engagement in virtual reality (VR)-based learning environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Our results show that users with personalized avatars demonstrated significant increases in motivation, self-efficacy, and overall learning experience compared to those with generic avatars. We also analyzed the effects of avatar customization on user behavior, finding that users who customized their avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement and immersion. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based educational systems, highlighting the importance of personalized avatars in fostering a more engaging and effective learning experience.
