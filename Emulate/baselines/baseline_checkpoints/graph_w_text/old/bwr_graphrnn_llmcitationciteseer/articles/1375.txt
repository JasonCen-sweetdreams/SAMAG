Autonomous vehicles must make rapid, high-stakes decisions in complex scenarios. We propose a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning (DHRL) framework, 'AV-DECIDE', which integrates high-level goal-directed planning with low-level motion control. Our approach uses a hierarchical policy structure, with a high-level planner selecting goals and a low-level controller generating motion primitives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AV-DECIDE in a variety of simulated scenarios, including urban intersections, pedestrian zones, and highway merging. Experimental results show that AV-DECIDE outperforms flat reinforcement learning baselines in terms of decision-making speed, safety, and adaptability.
