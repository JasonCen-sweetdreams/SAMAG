This study investigates the impact of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) on cognitive load in older adults. We designed an ECA-based interface to assist older adults with daily tasks and evaluated its effectiveness in reducing cognitive load compared to traditional graphical user interfaces. Our results show that the ECA-based interface significantly reduced cognitive load, as measured by pupillary response and self-reported surveys. We also found that the ECA's embodied features, such as gestures and facial expressions, improved user engagement and trust. The findings have implications for the design of accessible and supportive technologies for older adults.
