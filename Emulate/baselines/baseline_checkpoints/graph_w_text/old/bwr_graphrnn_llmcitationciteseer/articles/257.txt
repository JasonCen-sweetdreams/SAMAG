Mobile text entry is a ubiquitous task that remains error-prone and inefficient. This paper presents EyeGazeType, a novel system that leverages gaze-based gesture recognition to enhance text entry on mobile devices. Our approach uses a convolutional neural network to classify gaze patterns into gesture commands, which are then used to control a soft keyboard. We evaluate EyeGazeType on a dataset of 30 participants and demonstrate a significant reduction in error rate and improvement in entry speed compared to traditional touch-based input methods. The implications of our work have far-reaching potential for individuals with motor disabilities and for enhancing mobile productivity in general.
