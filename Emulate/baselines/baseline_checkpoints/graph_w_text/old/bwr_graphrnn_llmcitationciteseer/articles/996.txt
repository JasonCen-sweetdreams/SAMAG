Distributed database systems face significant challenges in optimizing query execution plans. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans in real-time. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict optimal join orders and indexing strategies based on query patterns, data distributions, and system workload. Experimental evaluation on a popular benchmark dataset shows that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
