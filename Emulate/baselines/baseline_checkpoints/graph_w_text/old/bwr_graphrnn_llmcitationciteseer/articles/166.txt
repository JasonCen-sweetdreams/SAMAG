Virtual Reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but understanding the role of avatar embodiment on user experience remains a crucial research gap. This study explores the effect of personalized avatar embodiment on user experience in VR, focusing on self-presence, immersion, and emotional response. We developed a novel VR platform that enables real-time avatar customization and conducted a user study with 120 participants. Results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance self-presence and immersion, while also influencing emotional response to virtual stimuli. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems, highlighting the importance of incorporating user-centered avatar embodiment to create more engaging and effective VR experiences.
