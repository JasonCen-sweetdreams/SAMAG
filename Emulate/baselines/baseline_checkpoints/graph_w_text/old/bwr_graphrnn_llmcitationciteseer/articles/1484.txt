In multi-agent systems, cooperative exploration aims to maximize the coverage of an unknown environment while minimizing the number of agents required. This paper proposes a novel adaptive task allocation algorithm, 'ATAlex', which dynamically assigns tasks to agents based on their local observations and communication with neighbors. We introduce a decentralized decision-making mechanism that incorporates a probabilistic model of the environment, enabling agents to adapt to changing conditions and prioritize unexplored areas. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that ATAlex outperforms existing methods in terms of exploration efficiency and robustness to agent failures.
