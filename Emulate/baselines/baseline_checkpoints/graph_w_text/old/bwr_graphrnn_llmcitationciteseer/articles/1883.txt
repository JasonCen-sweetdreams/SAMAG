The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential growth in graph-structured data, necessitating efficient query processing mechanisms. This paper presents a novel graph database, 'Grafios', designed to handle massive-scale IoT data in real-time. Grafios leverages a distributed, in-memory architecture and introduces a novel query optimization technique, 'PathPrune', which reduces query latency by up to 70% compared to existing graph databases. We evaluate Grafios on a large-scale IoT dataset, demonstrating its scalability and efficiency in processing complex graph queries.
