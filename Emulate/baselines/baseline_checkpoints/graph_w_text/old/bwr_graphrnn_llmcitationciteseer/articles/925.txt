Dense retrieval models have shown promising results in passage retrieval tasks, but they often struggle to capture the nuances of the query. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach that selectively incorporates relevant context from the document to enhance the retrieval process. Our method, dubbed 'QueryEx', leverages a combination of semantic role labeling and entity disambiguation to identify the most informative phrases in the document. Experimental results on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset demonstrate that QueryEx significantly improves the top-k retrieval performance of state-of-the-art dense retrieval models, especially for long-tail queries.
