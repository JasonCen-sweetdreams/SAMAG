Distributed databases have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel learning-based approach for index selection, which significantly improves query performance. Our method, called 'QLearn', uses a reinforcement learning framework to learn the optimal index configuration for a given query workload. We evaluate QLearn on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its ability to reduce query latency by up to 40% compared to traditional index selection techniques.
