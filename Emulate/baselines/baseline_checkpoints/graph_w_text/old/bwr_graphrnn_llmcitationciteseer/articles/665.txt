Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent, but their adoption among older adults is hindered by accessibility barriers. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction framework, 'EasyVocal', designed to facilitate voice-based interactions for older adults. We integrate speech recognition with gesture and gaze tracking to enhance user experience and reduce errors. A user study with 30 older adults demonstrates that EasyVocal outperforms existing voice assistants in terms of task completion rate, user satisfaction, and cognitive load reduction. The framework's modular architecture enables seamless integration with various smart home devices and IoT systems.
