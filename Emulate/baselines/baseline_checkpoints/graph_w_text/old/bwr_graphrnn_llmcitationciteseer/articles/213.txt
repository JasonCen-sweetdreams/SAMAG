Real-time information retrieval (RTIR) systems require efficient document filtering to cope with massive query volumes. This paper presents a novel neural ranking model, 'NeuFilter', that leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively filter documents based on their relevance to the query. We propose a two-stage training approach, where the model is first trained on a large dataset of labeled queries and then fine-tuned on a smaller RTIR-specific dataset. Experimental results on the TREC RTIR dataset demonstrate that NeuFilter achieves significant improvements in filtering efficiency and ranking accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining low latency and high throughput.
