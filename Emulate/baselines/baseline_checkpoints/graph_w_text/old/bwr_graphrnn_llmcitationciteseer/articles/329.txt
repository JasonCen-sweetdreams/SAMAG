Virtual reality (VR) systems often struggle to accurately recognize user gestures, leading to frustration and decreased immersion. This paper presents a novel adaptive gesture recognition framework that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to improve recognition accuracy and robustness. Our approach incorporates real-time user feedback, environment awareness, and personalized gesture modeling to dynamically adapt to individual users' behavior. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art VR gesture recognition systems.
