In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our approach, called MATRL, leverages a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn optimal task allocation policies for each agent. We introduce a novel attention mechanism that enables agents to selectively weigh the importance of tasks and communicate with each other to resolve conflicts. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that MATRL outperforms traditional centralized optimization methods and other decentralized approaches in terms of task completion rate, latency, and robustness to agent failures.
