Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing methods often struggle to provide meaningful explanations for complex user-item interactions. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework for ERS. HGAT leverages multi-scale graph attention mechanisms to capture both local and global patterns in user-item graphs, enabling the model to generate more informative and personalized explanations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
