Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it can significantly improve the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for query expansion, termed 'QNLP', which leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and their contextualized embeddings. QNLP uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively expand the query, and a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the expansion process. Experimental results on the TREC datasets demonstrate that QNLP outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
