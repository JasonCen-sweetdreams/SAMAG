Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, as it can significantly impact the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to query expansion, which learns to select the most relevant expansion terms by optimizing a reward function that incorporates both relevance and diversity. Our DRL model, dubbed 'RL-Expander', uses a hierarchical architecture to capture both local and global contextual information in the query and documents. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that RL-Expander outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, including RM3 and KLD, in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
