Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on handcrafted features and fail to capture complex semantic relationships. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'QNEX', which learns to expand queries by modeling the interactions between query terms and the document collection. QNEX consists of a query encoder, a document encoder, and a relevance predictor, trained jointly using a ranking loss function. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QNEX outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
