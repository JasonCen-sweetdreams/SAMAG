Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features, enabling efficient and accurate emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of three layers: modality attention, feature attention, and emotion prediction. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 92.5% accuracy and reducing computational cost by 30% compared to existing fusion-based methods.
