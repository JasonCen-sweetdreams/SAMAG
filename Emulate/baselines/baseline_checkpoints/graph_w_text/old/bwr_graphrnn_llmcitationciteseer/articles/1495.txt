Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of life, but users with motor disabilities face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents a comprehensive study on designing accessible VR interfaces for users with motor disabilities. We conducted user studies with 20 participants to identify key challenges and developed a set of design guidelines for accessible VR interfaces. Our results show that incorporating personalized gesture recognition, adaptive difficulty levels, and multimodal feedback can significantly improve the VR experience for users with motor disabilities. We also propose a novel evaluation framework to assess the accessibility of VR interfaces.
