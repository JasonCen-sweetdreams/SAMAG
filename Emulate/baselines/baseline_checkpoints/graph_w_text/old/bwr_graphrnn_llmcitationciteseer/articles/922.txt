Neural search engines have shown promising results in retrieving relevant documents, but often struggle with query ambiguity and limited context. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'ContextQE', which leverages contextualized word embeddings to disambiguate query terms and capture nuanced semantic relationships. By incorporating both local and global contextual information, ContextQE improves the quality of expanded queries and enhances the retrieval performance of neural search engines. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ContextQE in retrieving relevant documents, especially for queries with ambiguous terms.
