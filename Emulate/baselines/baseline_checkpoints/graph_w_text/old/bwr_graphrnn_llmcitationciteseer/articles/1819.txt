Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. Traditional methods often rely on hand-crafted features, which may not capture complex patterns. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach using graph-based autoencoders (GAEs). We model time-series data as graphs, where each node represents a timestamp, and edges capture temporal dependencies. Our GAE-based framework, 'AnoGraph', learns to reconstruct the input graph, enabling the detection of anomalies as nodes with high reconstruction errors. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AnoGraph in detecting anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
