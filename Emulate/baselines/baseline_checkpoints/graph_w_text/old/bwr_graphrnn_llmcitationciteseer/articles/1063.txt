Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that not only provides accurate recommendations but also generates transparent and interpretable explanations. Our model leverages the hierarchical structure of user-item interactions to learn multi-level attention weights, which are used to compute feature importance scores. We evaluate HGAT on three real-world datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation performance and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
