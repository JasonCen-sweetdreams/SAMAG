With the increasing adoption of cloud-based relational databases, efficient query optimization has become crucial for multi-tenant environments. This paper presents 'OptiQT', a novel query optimization framework that leverages statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to minimize response times and improve resource utilization. Our approach involves modeling query patterns and resource contention across tenants, and adaptively adjusting query plans to optimize performance. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database show that OptiQT reduces average query latency by 35% and improves CPU utilization by 25% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
