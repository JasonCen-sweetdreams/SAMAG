Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in enhancing learning experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR-based learning environments. We designed and implemented a VR platform that incorporates personalized avatars and conducted a user study with 120 participants. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, particularly among individuals with low self-efficacy. We also found that users' sense of presence and immersion in the VR environment are positively correlated with their engagement levels. These findings have implications for the design of VR-based learning systems that aim to increase user motivation and participation.
