Deep neural ranking models have revolutionized information retrieval (IR) by capturing complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. However, their computational overhead hinders their adoption in large-scale search applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document clustering approach, 'HiDR', to accelerate the retrieval process. By partitioning the document collection into a hierarchy of clusters, HiDR reduces the number of candidate documents that need to be scored by the neural ranking model. Experiments on the TREC Deep Learning Track dataset demonstrate that HiDR achieves a 3x speedup in retrieval time while maintaining the ranking accuracy of the underlying neural model.
