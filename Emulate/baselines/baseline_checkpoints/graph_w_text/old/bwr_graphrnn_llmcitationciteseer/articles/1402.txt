Intelligent traffic management systems rely on the coordination of multiple agents, such as traffic lights, ramp meters, and variable message signs. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating heterogeneous agents using multi-objective reinforcement learning. Our framework, 'SmartTraffic', learns to optimize competing objectives, including traffic flow, safety, and environmental impact, in real-time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SmartTraffic in a simulated traffic network, showing significant reductions in congestion, accidents, and emissions compared to traditional rule-based control methods.
