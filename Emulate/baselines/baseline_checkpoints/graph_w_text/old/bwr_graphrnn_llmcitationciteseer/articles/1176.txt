As multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need for interpretable decision-making mechanisms. This paper introduces HAT-MAD, a hierarchical attention network framework that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent settings. HAT-MAD leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and features, generating contextualized explanations for joint decision-making outcomes. We evaluate HAT-MAD on a realistic traffic simulation environment, demonstrating improved explainability and decision-making performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
