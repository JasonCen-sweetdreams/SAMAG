Virtual reality (VR) systems have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but their adoption is hindered by user discomfort and fatigue. This study investigates the role of personalized haptic feedback in enhancing user experience in VR. We propose a novel framework that leverages machine learning to adapt haptic feedback to individual users' preferences and motor abilities. Our user study involving 30 participants shows that personalized haptic feedback significantly improves user satisfaction, reduces motion sickness, and enhances overall VR experience. The results have important implications for the design of future VR systems and applications.
