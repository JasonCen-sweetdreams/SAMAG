Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in smart homes, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by limited accessibility features. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant, focusing on older adults with hearing impairments, cognitive decline, and limited technical expertise. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving surveys, interviews, and usability testing to identify key accessibility barriers and opportunities. Our findings led to the development of 'ElderVoice', a voice assistant with customized accessibility features, including real-time transcription, personalized speech recognition, and cognitive support. Results show that ElderVoice significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction among older adults, highlighting the need for inclusive design in voice assistant development.
