Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and trustworthy suggestions to users. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that leverages graph-based representations to model complex user-item relationships. HGAT incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to identify influential neighbors and aggregate features. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods on benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and interpretability. We also provide visualizations to illustrate the explainability of our model, facilitating user understanding and trust in the recommendation process.
