Sentiment analysis in low-resource languages remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated data. This paper proposes a deep transfer learning approach that leverages pre-trained language models and multimodal fusion techniques to improve sentiment classification in these languages. We introduce a novel architecture that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction with bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for text feature extraction. Experimental results on a multimodal dataset of social media posts in three low-resource languages demonstrate significant improvements in sentiment classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
