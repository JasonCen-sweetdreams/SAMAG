Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized the way we interact with digital environments. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge in VR applications. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatar customization on user engagement in VR. We designed an experimental study where participants were randomly assigned to either a personalized avatar group or a standardized avatar group. Our results show that users who customized their avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported enjoyment. We also found that the level of customization complexity influenced user engagement, with users preferring moderate levels of customization. The findings have implications for the design of VR applications, highlighting the importance of user-centered design and personalization.
