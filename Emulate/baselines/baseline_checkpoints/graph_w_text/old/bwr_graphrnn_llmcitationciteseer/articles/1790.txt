Medical information retrieval (IR) systems often struggle to capture the nuances of medical terminology, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages deep neural networks to learn domain-specific term embeddings. Our approach, 'MedExp', integrates a stacked denoising autoencoder with a term importance weighting scheme to generate context-aware expansion terms. Evaluations on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset demonstrate that MedExp significantly outperforms traditional expansion methods, achieving a 22% improvement in mean average precision. We also explore the interpretability of our model using attention-based visualization techniques.
