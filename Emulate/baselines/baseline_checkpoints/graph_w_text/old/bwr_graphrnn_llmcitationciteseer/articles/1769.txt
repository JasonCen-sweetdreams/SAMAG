Coordinating task allocation among multiple agents in complex environments is a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in multi-agent systems. We introduce a decentralized, model-free algorithm that learns to coordinate agents' actions based on local observations and rewards. Our approach outperforms traditional methods in simulated environments with varying task complexity and agent capabilities. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm in a real-world scenario, showcasing its potential for efficient task allocation in autonomous systems.
