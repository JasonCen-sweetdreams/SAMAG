In this paper, we present a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and expertise need to cooperate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a reinforcement learning approach that enables agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing task requirements and agent availability. Our approach leverages a Graph Attention Network to model agent-agent relationships and a Deep Q-Network to optimize task allocation decisions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion efficiency and agent utilization.
