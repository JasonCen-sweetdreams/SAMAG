Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR) due to the lack of explicit query intent. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep neural networks, dubbed 'DeepQE'. We leverage pre-trained language models to generate context-aware query embeddings, which are then used to select relevant expansion terms. Our experiments on several TREC benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods. We also analyze the effectiveness of DeepQE in handling complex queries and its robustness to query ambiguity.
