Vertical search engines require efficient and accurate document retrieval strategies to provide relevant results. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'DeepVR', which leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn semantic representations of documents and queries. Our approach outperforms traditional ranking models on several benchmark datasets, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision and a 20% reduction in retrieval time. We also explore the application of DeepVR to specific vertical domains, such as product search and job search, demonstrating its adaptability and effectiveness.
