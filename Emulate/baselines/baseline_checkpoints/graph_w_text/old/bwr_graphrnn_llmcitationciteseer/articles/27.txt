Optimizing query plans in distributed database systems is a complex task that requires balancing multiple performance metrics. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans in response to changing workload patterns. Our algorithm, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that maximizes throughput while minimizing latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a simulated distributed database system demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques, achieving up to 30% improvement in throughput and 25% reduction in latency.
