Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in node classification tasks, but their computational complexity and memory requirements often hinder their applicability to large-scale graphs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages a multi-resolution graph representation to reduce computational overhead while preserving performance. We introduce a graph coarsening technique that adaptively selects nodes for attention-based feature aggregation, enabling efficient processing of large graphs. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models while achieving significant speedups.
