In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical challenge, particularly in decentralized settings where agents have limited communication and coordination. This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism, 'DeAuct', that enables agents to bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. DeAuct uses a distributed Vickrey auction protocol to allocate tasks efficiently, while ensuring truthfulness and individual rationality. We evaluate DeAuct through extensive simulations, demonstrating its superiority over existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time, agent satisfaction, and system efficiency.
