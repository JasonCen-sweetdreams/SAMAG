Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of query terms and documents. Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model complex contextual relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
