Multi-agent systems have become increasingly prevalent in various applications, including robotics, transportation, and smart cities. Effective task allocation is crucial to ensure efficient and coordinated agent behavior. This paper proposes a novel approach to autonomous task allocation using reinforcement learning. We introduce a decentralized, model-free algorithm that enables agents to learn optimal task assignments based on observed system states and rewards. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional, rule-based methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
