Distributed graph databases have gained popularity for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of graph traversals and data distribution. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph summarization and machine learning-based cost estimation to efficiently optimize queries. Our approach reduces query latency by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques, while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. We evaluate GraphOpt on several real-world graph datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in various query scenarios.
