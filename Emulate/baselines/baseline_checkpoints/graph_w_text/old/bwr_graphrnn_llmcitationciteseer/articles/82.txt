Traditional query expansion techniques in medical information retrieval (IR) rely on statistical methods, which often struggle to capture complex semantic relationships between medical concepts. This paper proposes a neural embedding-based approach, MedEmb, which leverages large-scale biomedical knowledge graphs to learn dense vector representations of medical entities. We integrate MedEmb with a relevance feedback-based query expansion framework, demonstrating significant improvements in retrieval performance on the TREC-CDS 2016 dataset. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly for queries with ambiguous or rare terms.
