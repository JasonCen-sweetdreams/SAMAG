Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their usability by older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, 'EasySpeak', tailored to the needs of this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify key challenges and design requirements. EasySpeak incorporates several innovative features, including personalized vocabulary adaptation, error tolerance, and multimodal feedback. Our evaluation with 30 older adults with cognitive impairments demonstrates improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing commercial voice assistants.
