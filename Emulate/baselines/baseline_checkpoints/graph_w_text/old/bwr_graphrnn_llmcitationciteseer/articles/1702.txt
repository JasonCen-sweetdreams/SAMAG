Multi-hop question answering over knowledge graphs (KGs) is a challenging task that requires modeling complex relationships between entities. Existing methods either rely on expensive graph traversal or suffer from limited expressiveness in capturing hierarchical dependencies. We propose a novel KG embedding framework, 'HierKG', which leverages hierarchical attention to learn multi-granular representations of entities and relationships. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including HotPotQA and MetaQA, while reducing inference time by up to 30% compared to previous methods.
