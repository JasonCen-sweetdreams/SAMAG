Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural sentence embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Our method, dubbed 'NeuralExpansion', uses a combination of sentence transformers and graph-based ranking to generate a set of relevant expansion terms. Experimental results on several TREC benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuralExpansion outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, including RM3 and KL-divergence, in terms of precision, recall, and nDCG.
