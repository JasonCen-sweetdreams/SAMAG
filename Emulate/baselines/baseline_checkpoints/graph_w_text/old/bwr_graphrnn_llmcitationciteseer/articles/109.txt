Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to developing inclusive voice assistants that accommodate the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying key barriers to voice assistant adoption and proposing a set of design guidelines to enhance accessibility. Our prototype, 'EasySpeak', incorporates features such as simplified dialogue flows, visual feedback, and error tolerance, demonstrating improved usability and user satisfaction in a controlled experiment.
