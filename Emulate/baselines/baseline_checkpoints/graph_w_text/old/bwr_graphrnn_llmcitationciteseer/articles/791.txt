Document retrieval systems often struggle to return diverse and relevant results, particularly when dealing with complex queries. This paper proposes a novel approach based on hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to improve the diversity and relevance of retrieved documents. Our model learns to represent documents as graph structures, capturing both local and global relationships between entities and concepts. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of novelty, diversity, and relevance, while maintaining comparable computational efficiency.
