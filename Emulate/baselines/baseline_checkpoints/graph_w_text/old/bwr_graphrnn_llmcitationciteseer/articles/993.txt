Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query execution plans. We introduce a framework that uses graph neural networks to model the query optimization problem and reinforcement learning to learn efficient optimization strategies. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database system shows that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
