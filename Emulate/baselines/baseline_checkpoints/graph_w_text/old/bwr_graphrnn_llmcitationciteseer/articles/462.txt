Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) are crucial for building trustworthy AI applications. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that jointly learns item and user representations in a graph-structured latent space. HGAT incorporates node-wise attention mechanisms to highlight influential items and users, thereby providing personalized explanations for top-N recommendations. We evaluate HGAT on three real-world datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art ERS models.
