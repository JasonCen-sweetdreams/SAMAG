Multi-tenant database systems are increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing query performance for diverse workloads and tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our RL-based optimizer, 'QueryMax', learns to adapt to changing workloads and tenant priorities, outperforming traditional rule-based optimizers. We evaluate QueryMax on a real-world multi-tenant database and demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and resource utilization.
