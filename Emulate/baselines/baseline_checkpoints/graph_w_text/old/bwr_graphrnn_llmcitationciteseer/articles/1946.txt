The rapid growth of document collections has rendered traditional query expansion techniques inefficient. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and documents to improve retrieval efficiency. HQE first constructs a hierarchical representation of the query using WordNet and then expands the query by traversing the hierarchy. Experimental results on the TREC collection demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and query processing time.
