Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using graph-based models, which capture complex relationships between database fragments and query patterns. Our proposed algorithm, 'GraphOpt', leverages graph convolutional networks to learn a compact representation of the database graph and optimize query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and reduces the number of query rewrites by 25%.
