Effective task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities need to collaborate to achieve complex goals. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Our method, called GraphTask, represents the agent-task graph as a heterogeneous graph and leverages GCNs to learn a task allocation policy that maximizes overall system utility. We evaluate GraphTask on a variety of scenarios and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing agent capabilities and task requirements, outperforming traditional centralized approaches.
