Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their adoption among older adults is hindered by various barriers. This study investigates the accessibility features of popular voice assistants and identifies areas for improvement. We conducted a mixed-methods study, combining surveys, interviews, and usability testing with 30 older adults. Our findings highlight the need for personalized speech recognition, visual feedback, and simplified workflows. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants and demonstrate their effectiveness through a prototype implementation. Our work contributes to the development of more accessible and usable voice assistants, enabling older adults to fully benefit from these technologies.
