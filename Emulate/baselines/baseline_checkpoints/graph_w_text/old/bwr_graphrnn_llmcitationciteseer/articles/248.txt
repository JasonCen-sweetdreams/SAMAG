Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, aiming to refine the original query to better match the user's intent. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, dubbed 'DeepQE'. By leveraging a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks, DeepQE learns to identify relevant terms and phrases from the top-retrieved documents, outperforming traditional methods such as Rocchio and KL-divergence. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepQE in improving retrieval accuracy, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
