Traditional retrieval models often struggle to balance relevance and diversity in search results. We propose a novel neural ranking model that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize a diversified ranking objective. Our approach, dubbed 'DivRank', learns to balance precision and novelty by directly optimizing a metric that rewards diverse and relevant document retrieval. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DivRank outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both relevance and diversity metrics, while maintaining a high level of efficiency.
