Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between the user's query and relevant documents. This paper introduces a novel approach, 'NeuQE', which leverages deep neural ranking models to generate context-aware expanded queries. NeuQE employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to model the semantic relationships between query terms and document contents, enabling more effective expansion of relevant keywords. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, leading to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
