Traditional information retrieval systems rely on hand-crafted features and bag-of-words representations, which fail to capture complex document structures and relationships. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model for document retrieval, which learns to represent documents as hierarchical graph structures. Our HGNN model consists of a document encoder, a graph attention module, and a retrieval module. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving a 12% improvement in Mean Average Precision (MAP) and a 15% improvement in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) at rank 10.
