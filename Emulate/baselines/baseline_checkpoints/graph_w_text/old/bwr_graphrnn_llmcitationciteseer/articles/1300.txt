Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but existing methods often struggle to capture nuanced query semantics. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, dubbed 'CAQE', which leverages context-aware embeddings to disambiguate query terms and improve retrieval performance. By incorporating contextualized BERT embeddings and a graph-based attention mechanism, CAQE effectively captures query-term relationships and generates more informative expansion terms. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art QE methods, particularly for queries with ambiguous or polysemous terms.
