In this paper, we address the problem of efficient task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'AgentTA', that leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to learn optimal task assignments. Our approach considers the diverse capabilities and resource constraints of agents, as well as the complex dependencies between tasks. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that AgentTA outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system scalability.
