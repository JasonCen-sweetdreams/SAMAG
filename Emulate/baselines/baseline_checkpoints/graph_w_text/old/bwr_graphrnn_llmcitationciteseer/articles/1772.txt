This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. We propose an algorithm that leverages the concept of options to enable agents to learn complex, high-level behaviors in a decentralized manner. Our approach is evaluated on a variety of task allocation scenarios, demonstrating improved scalability and adaptability compared to existing methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's convergence properties and show that it can achieve near-optimal performance in many cases.
