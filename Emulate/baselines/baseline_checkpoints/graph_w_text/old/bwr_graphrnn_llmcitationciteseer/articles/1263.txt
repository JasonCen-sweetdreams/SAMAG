In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem that requires efficient assignment of tasks to agents while considering their capabilities, resources, and preferences. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal task assignment policies. Our approach, called DRL-TA, uses a multi-agent deep Q-network to learn the value functions of each agent and a decentralized auction mechanism to allocate tasks. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm domain show that DRL-TA outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time, agent utility, and system adaptability.
