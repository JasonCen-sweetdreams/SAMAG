The growing adoption of Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms has led to an increasing need for efficient query optimization techniques that can handle multi-tenancy. Existing approaches often rely on static analysis and fail to adapt to dynamic workload patterns. In this work, we propose a novel, adaptive query optimization framework, 'AQO', which leverages machine learning-based predictive modeling to identify optimal query plans. AQO incorporates a feedback loop that continuously refines its optimization strategy based on query performance metrics. Our evaluation on a real-world DBaaS platform shows that AQO achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
