The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors has led to an explosion of time-series data, necessitating efficient indexing techniques for fast analytics. This paper presents a novel indexing strategy, 'TS-Tree', specifically designed for distributed time-series databases. TS-Tree leverages a hierarchical, space-partitioning approach to reduce query latency and improve data locality. We evaluate TS-Tree on a real-world IoT dataset and demonstrate significant performance gains compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving an average query speedup of 3.2x.
