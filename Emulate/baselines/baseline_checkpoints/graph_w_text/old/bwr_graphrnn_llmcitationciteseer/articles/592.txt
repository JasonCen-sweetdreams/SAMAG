Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize the way people interact with digital information, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework that incorporates audio-haptic feedback and gesture recognition to enable accessible navigation and interaction. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with visual impairments and found significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional screen-reader-based interfaces. Our results have implications for the development of inclusive VR systems that can be used by a broader range of users.
