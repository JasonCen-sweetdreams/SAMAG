Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. We propose a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights into the anomaly patterns. Our HAN model consists of two levels of attention: a local attention mechanism that focuses on relevant segments within a time-series, and a global attention mechanism that weights the importance of different time-series features. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved detection performance and robustness to anomalies of varying duration and intensity.
