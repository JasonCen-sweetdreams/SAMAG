Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when dealing with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel deep metric learning approach, 'HierProto', which leverages hierarchical prototypes to learn robust and transferable feature representations. By constructing a hierarchical prototype graph, we enable the model to capture complex relationships between classes and adapt to new tasks with minimal labeled data. Experimental results on benchmarks such as MiniImageNet and CIFAR-FS demonstrate that HierProto achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing few-shot learning methods.
