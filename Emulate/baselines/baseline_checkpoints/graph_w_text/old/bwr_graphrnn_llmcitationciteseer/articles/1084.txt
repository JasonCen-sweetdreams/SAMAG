Decentralized autonomous agents (DAAs) have the potential to revolutionize various applications, but coordinating their actions remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel framework, 'Blockchain-DAAC', which leverages blockchain technology to facilitate decentralized coordination and incentivize cooperation among DAAs. We design a token-based incentive mechanism that rewards agents for truthfully reporting their actions and outcomes, thereby promoting trust and cooperation. Experimental results show that Blockchain-DAAC outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of scalability, fairness, and social welfare.
