Recommendation systems have become increasingly complex, making it challenging to understand their decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that not only improves recommendation accuracy but also provides transparent and interpretable explanations for its suggestions. Our HAN model incorporates multiple levels of attention, allowing it to capture both item- and user-level relationships. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both performance and explainability.
