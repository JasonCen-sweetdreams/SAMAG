Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern applications, but optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. Our approach, dubbed 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the system's current workload, network latency, and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and reduces the number of network transmissions by up to 25%
