Cooperative task allocation is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must jointly decide on tasks to maximize overall system efficiency. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'MA-CRAL', that enables agents to learn cooperative strategies for task allocation. We introduce a decentralized, asynchronous learning mechanism that leverages graph neural networks to represent agent interactions and a novel reward function that encourages cooperation. Experimental results on a range of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that MA-CRAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency.
