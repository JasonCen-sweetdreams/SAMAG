Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, directly impacting performance and scalability. Traditional optimization techniques rely on manual tuning or rule-based heuristics, often resulting in suboptimal plans. This paper presents 'QOptRL', a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed settings. We design a Markov decision process that models the query optimization problem and propose a deep Q-network-based algorithm to learn an optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that QOptRL outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, achieving up to 3.5x speedup and 2.2x reduction in resource utilization.
