Query drift, where user search intent changes over time, significantly impacts the effectiveness of real-time search systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to mitigating query drift using reinforcement learning. Our method, called 'DriftRL', leverages user feedback to adapt the query representation and ranking models in real-time. We introduce a reward function that balances short-term relevance with long-term query intent, and demonstrate improved search performance and reduced query drift on a large-scale search log dataset. Experiments show that DriftRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in adapting to changing user search behavior.
