Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized interactive experiences, but existing interfaces often rely on cumbersome controllers or limited voice commands. This paper introduces 'GazeUI', a gaze-based intelligent interface that leverages eye-tracking to enable seamless user interactions in VR. Our system integrates machine learning-based gaze prediction with a probabilistic inference engine to accurately infer user intent. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that GazeUI reduces interaction time by 35% and improves user satisfaction by 25% compared to traditional controllers. Our approach has significant implications for enhancing user experience and accessibility in VR applications.
