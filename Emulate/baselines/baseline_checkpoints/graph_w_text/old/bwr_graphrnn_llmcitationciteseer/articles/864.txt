Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are designed to handle large-scale data, but query processing remains a bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach to improve retrieval efficiency in DIR systems. HQE leverages semantic relationships between query terms to generate a hierarchical representation of the query, which is then used to prune irrelevant documents and reduce the search space. Experiments on a large-scale text dataset demonstrate that HQE achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency, precision, and recall compared to traditional query expansion methods.
