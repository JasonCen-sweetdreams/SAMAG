This paper investigates the role of haptic feedback in enhancing gesture recognition in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed a VR-based gesture recognition system that incorporates vibrotactile feedback, and conducted a user study with 30 participants to evaluate its performance. Our results show that the inclusion of haptic feedback significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy, particularly for complex gestures. We also found that users reported higher levels of immersion and engagement when haptic feedback was present. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based interfaces that rely on gesture recognition, and highlight the importance of considering the role of haptic feedback in these systems.
