Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or nuanced queries. This paper presents a novel approach to query representation, leveraging deep contextualized embeddings to capture subtle semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, dubbed 'ConQR', integrates BERT-based embeddings with a graph-based query expansion framework, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness. Experiments on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate that ConQR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for queries with multiple entities or intent shifts.
