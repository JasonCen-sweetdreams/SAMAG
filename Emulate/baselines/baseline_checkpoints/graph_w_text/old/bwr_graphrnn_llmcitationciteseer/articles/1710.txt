Smart grids require efficient resource allocation to manage fluctuating demands and intermittent renewable energy sources. This paper presents a decentralized approach using autonomous agents to coordinate real-time resource allocation. We propose a novel auction-based mechanism that enables agents to negotiate and allocate resources dynamically, considering both economic and technical constraints. Simulation results on a realistic grid model demonstrate improved resource utilization, reduced congestion, and increased overall system efficiency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
