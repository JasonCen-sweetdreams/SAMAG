Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences, focusing on users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a participatory design study with 20 participants, identifying key accessibility barriers and designing solutions to address them. Our framework incorporates multimodal feedback, adaptable interaction mechanisms, and personalized accessibility settings. A user study with 30 participants demonstrated significant improvements in user experience and task performance for users with disabilities.
