The proliferation of IoT devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper presents a novel agent-based framework for allocating resources in IoT networks. Our approach, dubbed 'ARIA', leverages autonomous agents to negotiate and optimize resource assignments in real-time. We develop a decentralized, auction-based mechanism that enables agents to adapt to changing network conditions and device requirements. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT testbed demonstrate that ARIA achieves significant improvements in resource utilization and network performance compared to traditional centralized approaches.
