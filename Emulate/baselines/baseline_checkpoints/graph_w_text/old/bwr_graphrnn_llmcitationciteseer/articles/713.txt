Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can lead to misclassification. This paper presents a novel approach to adversarial training, combining hierarchical contrastive learning with online hard example mining. Our method, called 'HCL-Adv', improves the robustness of image classification models by learning a hierarchical representation of the input data, which is then used to generate diverse and informative adversarial examples. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset show that HCL-Adv outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial training methods, achieving an improvement of 3.2% in terms of robust accuracy against the strongest attacks.
