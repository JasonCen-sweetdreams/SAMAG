Node classification on graph-structured data is a fundamental task in many applications. However, existing methods often suffer from over-smoothing and are sensitive to graph perturbations. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical graph representations and attention mechanisms to improve robustness. HGAT consists of multiple layers, each of which applies attention to a hierarchy of graph neighborhoods. We demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving improved accuracy and robustness to graph perturbations. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis on the robustness of HGAT to node feature noise.
