Anomaly detection in high-dimensional data streams is a crucial task in various applications, including cybersecurity and IoT. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'iForest-Stream', which leverages the strengths of isolation forest ensemble and data stream clustering to detect anomalies in real-time. Our method incorporates a sliding window-based approach to handle concept drift and uses a novel feature importance measure to provide interpretable results. Experimental evaluation on several real-world datasets demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of iForest-Stream in detecting anomalies with high accuracy and low false positive rates.
