Gestural interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but individuals with motor disabilities often face significant barriers in interacting with these systems. This paper presents a novel design framework, 'GestAccess', which incorporates insights from occupational therapy and accessible design to create more inclusive gestural interfaces. We conducted a participatory design study with individuals with motor disabilities and developed a set of guidelines for designing accessible gestures, which were then validated through a usability study. Our results show that GestAccess-enabled interfaces can improve interaction success rates by up to 30% for individuals with motor disabilities, while also enhancing overall user experience.
