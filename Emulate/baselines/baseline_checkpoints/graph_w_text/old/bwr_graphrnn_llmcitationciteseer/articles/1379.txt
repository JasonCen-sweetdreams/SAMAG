Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but existing methods often struggle with scalability and accuracy. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global graph structures to improve node representation learning. HGAT employs a bottom-up attention mechanism to selectively aggregate node features across multiple graph scales, enabling efficient classification of nodes in large graphs. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
