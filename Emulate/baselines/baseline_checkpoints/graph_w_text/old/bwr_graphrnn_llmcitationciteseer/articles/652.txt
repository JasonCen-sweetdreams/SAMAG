In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to agents in a distributed manner. We model the agent network as a graph and learn a GNN-based task allocation policy that considers agent capabilities, task dependencies, and communication constraints. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralised allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilisation.
