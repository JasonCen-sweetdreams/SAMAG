Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that incorporates both item-level and user-level graph structures to generate personalized explanations for recommendations. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between users and items, enabling the generation of interpretable and diverse explanations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation performance and providing meaningful explanations.
