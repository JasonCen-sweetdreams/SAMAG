Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in DDS remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, called GIndex, which models the data distribution and query patterns as a graph. We develop an efficient query optimization algorithm that leverages GIndex to reduce the number of data transfers and improve query response time. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GIndex outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
