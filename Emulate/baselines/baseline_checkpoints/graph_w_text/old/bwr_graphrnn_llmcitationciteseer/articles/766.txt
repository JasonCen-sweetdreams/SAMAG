Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide transparent and accountable decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework for ERS, which leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships. Our approach hierarchically aggregates user and item representations, enabling the model to capture both local and global structural patterns in the graph. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
