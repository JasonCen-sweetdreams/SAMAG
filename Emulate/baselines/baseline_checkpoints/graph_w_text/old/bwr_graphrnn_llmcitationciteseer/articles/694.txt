Distributed database systems face significant performance challenges due to complex query optimization. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which can lead to suboptimal query plans. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'RL-Opt', that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution in distributed settings. RL-Opt uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy based on query semantics, data distribution, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in query execution time and 25% in resource utilization.
