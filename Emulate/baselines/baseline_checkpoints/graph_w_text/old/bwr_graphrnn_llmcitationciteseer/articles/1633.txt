Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide transparency and accountability in decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework for ERS, which leverages the strengths of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality, while providing insights into the underlying decision-making process.
