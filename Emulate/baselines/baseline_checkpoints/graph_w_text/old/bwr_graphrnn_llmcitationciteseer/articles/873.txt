This study investigates the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to alleviate cognitive load in elderly users. We designed an ECA-based system, 'CarePal', which employs natural language understanding and generation capabilities to assist users with daily tasks. Our user study involving 30 elderly participants revealed that CarePal significantly reduced cognitive load, as measured by pupillometry and self-reported metrics, compared to a text-based interface. Furthermore, we found that the ECA's embodiment features, such as gesturing and facial expressions, contributed to improved user engagement and trust. Our findings have implications for the design of accessible and supportive interfaces for aging populations.
