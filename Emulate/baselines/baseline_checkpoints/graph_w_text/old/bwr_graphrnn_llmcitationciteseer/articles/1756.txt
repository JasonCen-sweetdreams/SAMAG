With the increasing adoption of column-store databases in modern data warehousing and big data analytics, efficient query optimization techniques are crucial for improving performance. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'CSI', that leverages multi-dimensional indexing to accelerate query execution. CSI employs a probabilistic cost model that accurately estimates query execution times and selects the optimal indexing strategy for a given query workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that CSI achieves up to 3x performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
