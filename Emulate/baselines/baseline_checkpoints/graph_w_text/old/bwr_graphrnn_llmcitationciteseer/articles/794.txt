Emotion recognition from multimodal data (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and time segments to recognize emotions more accurately. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers and a hierarchical fusion module that integrates the outputs from each modality. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multimodal data.
