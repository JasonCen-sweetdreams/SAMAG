Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR), particularly in scenarios where query terms are ambiguous or context-dependent. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, dubbed 'QueryExpander'. By leveraging pre-trained language models and fine-tuning them on a large corpus of queries, QueryExpander generates context-aware expansions that significantly improve retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of QueryExpander over traditional query expansion techniques, achieving up to 25% improvement in mean average precision.
