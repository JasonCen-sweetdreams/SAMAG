Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting adversarial attacks on GNNs using hierarchical graph attention. Our method, 'GraphGuard', leverages the hierarchical structure of graphs to identify suspicious nodes and edges that are likely to be perturbed by an attacker. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphGuard outperforms existing attack detection methods, achieving an F1-score of 0.92 in detecting adversarial attacks on graph classification tasks.
