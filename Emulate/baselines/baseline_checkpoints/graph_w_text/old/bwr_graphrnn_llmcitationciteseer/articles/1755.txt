Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing intuitive interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in VR, focusing on the relationship between gestural input and cognitive load. We present a user study comparing three gestural input techniques (hand-tracking, controller-based, and hybrid) in a VR-based problem-solving task. Our results show that the hybrid approach, which combines hand-tracking with subtle haptic feedback, reduces cognitive load and improves task performance compared to traditional controller-based input. We discuss implications for VR interface design and future research directions.
