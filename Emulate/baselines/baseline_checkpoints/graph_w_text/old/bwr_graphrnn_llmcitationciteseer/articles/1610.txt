This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework for autonomous agents, leveraging swarm intelligence and reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'AgentSwarm', enables agents to learn from their environment and adapt to dynamic task requirements. We formulate the task allocation problem as a Markov decision process and use Q-learning to optimize agent decisions. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentSwarm outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and robustness to agent failures. The framework is evaluated in a simulated disaster response scenario, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.
