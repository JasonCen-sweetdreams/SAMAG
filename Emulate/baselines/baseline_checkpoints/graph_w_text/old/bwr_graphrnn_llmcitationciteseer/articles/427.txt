Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, are increasingly prevalent, but users with dyslexia often face barriers in interacting with these systems. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create more accessible conversational interfaces for individuals with dyslexia. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies, involving 20 participants with dyslexia, to identify key challenges and areas for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a set of design guidelines and recommendations for conversational interface designers, focusing on simplification of language, provision of multimodal feedback, and adaptive error handling.
