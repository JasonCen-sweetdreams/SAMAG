Object detection is a critical component in autonomous vehicle systems, requiring high accuracy and real-time performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture, dubbed 'AutoHAN', which integrates multi-scale feature fusion and spatial attention mechanisms to improve object detection efficiency. We demonstrate that AutoHAN outperforms state-of-the-art detectors on the KITTI benchmark, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision while reducing inference time by 30%. Our approach has significant implications for the deployment of accurate and efficient object detection systems in autonomous vehicles.
