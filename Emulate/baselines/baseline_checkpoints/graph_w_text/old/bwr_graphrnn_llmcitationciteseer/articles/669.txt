Traditional ranking models in information retrieval (IR) systems rely on static document representations, often resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a query-adaptive document ranking framework that leverages deep neural re-ranking to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. Our approach, dubbed 'QADR', uses a multi-task learning strategy to jointly optimize query-document similarity and relevance prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QADR on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art ranking models.
