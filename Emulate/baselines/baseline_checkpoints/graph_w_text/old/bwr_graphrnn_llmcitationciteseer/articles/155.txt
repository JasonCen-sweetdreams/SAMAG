Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem in distributed artificial intelligence. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages hierarchical graph attention networks (HGANs) to facilitate efficient communication and decision-making among agents. Our approach represents agents as nodes in a hierarchical graph, where each node corresponds to a specific task or subtask. We introduce a attention mechanism that adaptively weights the importance of neighboring agents, enabling the system to focus on critical tasks and allocate resources effectively. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that our HGAN-based approach outperforms traditional decentralized methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
