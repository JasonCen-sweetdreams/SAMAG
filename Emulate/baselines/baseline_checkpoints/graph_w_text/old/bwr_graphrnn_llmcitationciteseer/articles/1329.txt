Node classification in graph-structured data is a fundamental task in many applications. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown impressive results, they often require a large amount of labeled data, which may not be available in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages few-shot learning to classify nodes in graphs. HGAT adaptively selects relevant nodes and their neighbors to form a hierarchical representation, which is then used to predict node labels. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in few-shot node classification, outperforming state-of-the-art GNN models.
