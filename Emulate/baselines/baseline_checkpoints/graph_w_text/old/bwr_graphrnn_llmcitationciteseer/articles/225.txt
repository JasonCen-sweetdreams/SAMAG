Conversational search systems aim to facilitate more natural and interactive search experiences. However, the ambiguity and vagueness of natural language queries pose significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel query reformulation approach based on latent semantic analysis (LSA), which captures the underlying semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our method, 'LSA-Reform', leverages a jointly trained neural network to encode query and document semantics, and generates rewritten queries that better align with user intent. Experimental results on a large-scale conversational search dataset demonstrate that LSA-Reform improves query clarity and retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query reformulation techniques.
