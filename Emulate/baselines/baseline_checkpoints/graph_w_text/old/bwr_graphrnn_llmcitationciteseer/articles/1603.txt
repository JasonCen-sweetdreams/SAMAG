Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but the role of embodiment in shaping user experience remains poorly understood. This study explores the effects of embodiment on user engagement, presence, and cognitive load in VR. We designed an experiment where participants performed a series of tasks in a VR environment, either with or without embodied avatars. Our results show that embodied avatars significantly enhance user engagement and presence, while reducing cognitive load. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR systems and the potential applications in fields such as education, therapy, and entertainment.
