Traditional indexing methods for document retrieval rely on inverted indices or keyword extraction, which can be inefficient for large document collections. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph-based indexing approach, called 'DocGraph', which models document relationships as a graph and leverages graph clustering to prune the search space. Our experiments on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that DocGraph achieves a 30% reduction in query latency and a 25% increase in retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our approach is scalable and can be easily parallelized, making it suitable for large-scale document retrieval applications.
