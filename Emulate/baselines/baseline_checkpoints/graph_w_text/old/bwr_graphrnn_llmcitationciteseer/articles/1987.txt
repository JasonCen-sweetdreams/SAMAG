Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in various applications, but their scalability remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach, 'GraphHClus', to efficiently process large-scale graphs in GNNs. Our method leverages a multi-resolution graph representation to reduce the dimensionality of the input graph, and employs a scalable clustering algorithm to group similar nodes. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphHClus achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational costs by up to 70%. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality and scalability of our approach.
