Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data warehousing. However, optimizing query execution plans remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a decentralized agent-based system that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database environment and receiving rewards based on execution times. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
