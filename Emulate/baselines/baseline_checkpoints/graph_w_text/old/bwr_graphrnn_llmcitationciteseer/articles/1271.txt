This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, leveraging deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach, called DRL-TA, utilizes a graph neural network to learn agent embeddings and a deep Q-network to determine optimal task allocations based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and environmental constraints. We evaluate DRL-TA using a variety of scenarios and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and system efficiency compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
