In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized auction-based mechanism for task allocation, where agents bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We propose a novel bidding strategy that incorporates uncertainty and risk analysis, enabling agents to adapt to dynamic environments. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
