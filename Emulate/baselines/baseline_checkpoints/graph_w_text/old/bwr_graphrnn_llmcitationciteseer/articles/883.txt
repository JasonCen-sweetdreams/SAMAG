Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of the distributed environment. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database system and receiving feedback in the form of execution times. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of response time.
