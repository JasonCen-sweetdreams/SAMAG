Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a widely used technique to improve retrieval performance, but it often relies on heuristics or manual tuning. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to query expansion, where an agent learns to select expansion terms that maximize retrieval performance. We introduce a novel reward function that balances precision and recall, and demonstrate that our RL-based method outperforms state-of-the-art expansion techniques on several benchmark datasets.
