Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, called 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database schema, data distribution, and query workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
