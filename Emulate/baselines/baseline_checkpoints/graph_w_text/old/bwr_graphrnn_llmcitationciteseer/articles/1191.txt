Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and system scalability. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on heuristics or rule-based approaches, which can lead to suboptimal plans. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'RL-Opt', which learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database system. We design a reward function that captures query performance and resource utilization, and train an agent to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource efficiency.
