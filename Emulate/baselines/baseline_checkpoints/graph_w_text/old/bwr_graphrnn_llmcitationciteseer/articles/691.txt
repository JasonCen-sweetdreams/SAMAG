Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, 'CARE', which accommodates the needs of older adults with mild cognitive impairment. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements, such as simplified language, visual feedback, and personalized assistance. Our usability evaluation shows that CARE outperforms existing voice assistants in terms of task completion rates and user satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing accessible voice interfaces that promote aging in place.
