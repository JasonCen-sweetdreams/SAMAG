Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-structured data, where only a few labeled nodes are available for training. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages attention mechanisms at multiple scales to capture complex node relationships. HGAN consists of a node-level attention module that focuses on relevant neighbors and a graph-level attention module that adapts to the hierarchical graph structure. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification tasks, especially when the number of labeled nodes is extremely small.
