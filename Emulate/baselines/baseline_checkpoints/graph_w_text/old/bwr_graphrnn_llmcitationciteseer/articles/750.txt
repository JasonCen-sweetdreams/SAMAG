The proliferation of edge devices has created a growing need for efficient machine learning models that can operate under stringent resource constraints. This paper presents a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework, 'EdgeNAS', designed specifically for edge devices. EdgeNAS incorporates a differentiable NAS algorithm with a resource-aware objective function, allowing it to discover models that balance accuracy and computational cost. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EdgeNAS on several edge-oriented benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing latency and energy consumption by up to 3x compared to existing NAS methods.
