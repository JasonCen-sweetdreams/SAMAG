Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-based learning, where a model must generalize to new classes with limited labeled examples. We propose a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages the intrinsic structure of graphs to adapt to new classes. HGAT consists of a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant nodes and subgraphs, and a meta-learning framework that enables fast adaptation to new classes. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art few-shot node classification methods.
