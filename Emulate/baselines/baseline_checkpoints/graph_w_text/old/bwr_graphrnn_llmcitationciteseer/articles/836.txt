Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages deep learning-based semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and documents. Our approach uses a graph neural network to model the interaction between query terms and their contextualized semantic embeddings, generating a richer set of expansion terms that better capture the underlying query intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
