This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision-making. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to model complex agent interactions and learn hierarchical representations of agent intentions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a variety of multi-agent scenarios, including autonomous vehicle control and smart grid management. Experimental results show that HAN outperforms existing methods in terms of decision accuracy and interpretability, providing insights into agent decision-making processes.
