The growing scale and complexity of RDF graphs necessitate efficient indexing techniques for querying and data retrieval. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, Hierarchical Bloom Filter Indexing (HBFI), designed for distributed RDF graphs. HBFI leverages hierarchical Bloom filters to reduce the number of false positives and minimize communication overhead in distributed query processing. Our experiments on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that HBFI outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of query response time and network traffic reduction.
