Multi-tenant cloud databases require efficient query optimization to minimize resource contention and ensure responsive performance. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepQuery', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for diverse workloads. Our method uses a graph neural network to encode query graphs and learn a policy for selecting optimal join orders, indexing strategies, and resource allocations. Experimental evaluation on a real-world cloud database shows that DeepQuery outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques, reducing query latency by up to 35% and improving resource utilization by 20%.
