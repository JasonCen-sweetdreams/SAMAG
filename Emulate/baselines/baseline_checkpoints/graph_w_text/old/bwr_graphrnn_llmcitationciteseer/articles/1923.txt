Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interaction strategies often neglect the emotional and social nuances of human communication. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive voice assistants that incorporate emotional intelligence and conversational strategies. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with disabilities and found that our proposed approach significantly improved user satisfaction and reduced anxiety. Our framework consists of three components: emotional state detection, empathetic response generation, and adaptive conversational flow. We provide implications for future research and design recommendations for creating more empathetic and accessible voice assistants.
