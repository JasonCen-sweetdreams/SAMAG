Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide transparency and trust in AI-driven decision-making. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture for ERS, which models user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph structure. We leverage attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between users, items, and attributes, and provide personalized explanations for recommended items. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
