Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in many applications, including industrial monitoring and financial forecasting. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability, making it difficult to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explainable results. Our HAN model consists of a hierarchical encoder that captures multi-scale temporal dependencies and an attention mechanism that highlights the most relevant segments contributing to the anomaly score. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies and providing meaningful explanations.
