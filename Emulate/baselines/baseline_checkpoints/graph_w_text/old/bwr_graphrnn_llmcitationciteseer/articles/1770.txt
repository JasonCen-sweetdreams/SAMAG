Node classification in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is a challenging task due to the diversity of node types and relationships. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) model that leverages the hierarchical structure of HINs to improve node classification performance. HGAN employs a multi-level attention mechanism to adaptively focus on relevant nodes and relationships at each level of the hierarchy. Our experiments on several real-world HIN datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification accuracy, especially when dealing with noisy or incomplete data.
