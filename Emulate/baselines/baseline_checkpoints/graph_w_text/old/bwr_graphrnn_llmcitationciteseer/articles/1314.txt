Query facets are essential for effective document retrieval, but traditional methods suffer from limited semantic expressiveness and inefficient facet selection. This paper presents a novel approach, 'HierFac', which leverages hierarchical embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and document contents. By learning a nested representation of facet hierarchies, HierFac enables efficient pruning of irrelevant documents and improves retrieval accuracy. Our experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant gains in mean average precision and reduced query response times compared to state-of-the-art facet-based retrieval methods.
