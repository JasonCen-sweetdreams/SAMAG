Older adults with motor impairments often face significant barriers when interacting with modern gestural interfaces. This paper presents a novel design framework, 'Gentle Gestures', which incorporates insights from occupational therapy and human-computer interaction to create more accessible and inclusive interfaces. Our approach involves a combination of machine learning-based gesture recognition, adaptive feedback mechanisms, and personalized interface customization. A user study with 20 older adults with motor impairments demonstrates that Gentle Gestures significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and reduces user frustration compared to existing interface designs.
