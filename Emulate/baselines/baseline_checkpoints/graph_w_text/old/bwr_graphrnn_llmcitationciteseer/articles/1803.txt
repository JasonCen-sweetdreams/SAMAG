Explainable recommender systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to the need for transparency and trust in AI-driven decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) framework that jointly models user-item interactions and item relationships to generate personalized recommendations. Our approach leverages multi-hop graph attention to capture complex relationships between items and incorporates a novel explainability module that generates interpretable recommendations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HGAN over state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and explainability.
