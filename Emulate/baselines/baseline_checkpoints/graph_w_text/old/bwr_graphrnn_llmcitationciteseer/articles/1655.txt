Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR), particularly when dealing with ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages context-aware embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and document semantics. Our method integrates a graph-based attention mechanism to weigh the importance of expansion terms based on their contextual relevance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, with CAQE outperforming state-of-the-art expansion methods by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
