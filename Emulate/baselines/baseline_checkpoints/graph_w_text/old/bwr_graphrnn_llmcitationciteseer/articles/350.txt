Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their adoption among older adults is hindered by limitations in speech recognition, cognitive load, and accessibility. This paper presents 'EasyVoice', a multimodal interaction framework that integrates voice, gesture, and visual cues to facilitate more accessible and inclusive interactions. Our user-centered design approach involves a series of co-design workshops with older adults, resulting in a set of design principles and guidelines for developing more age-friendly voice assistants. We evaluate EasyVoice through a usability study, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction among older adults.
