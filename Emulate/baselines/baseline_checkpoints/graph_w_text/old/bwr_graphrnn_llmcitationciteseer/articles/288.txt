The increasing adoption of blockchain technology has led to the development of decentralized data management systems. However, query optimization in these systems remains an open challenge due to the lack of a centralized authority and the complexity of blockchain-specific query processing. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'BlocOpt', which leverages graph-based modeling and reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for blockchain-based distributed databases. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world blockchain-based database demonstrates that BlocOpt reduces query execution time by up to 50% compared to existing optimization techniques.
