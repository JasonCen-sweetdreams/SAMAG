This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the effects of gesture-based interaction on cognitive task performance. We designed a VR system that incorporates hand-tracking and gesture recognition, and conducted a user study with 30 participants. Our results show that gesture-based interaction significantly improves cognitive task performance, particularly in tasks requiring spatial reasoning and problem-solving. We also found that users' subjective experience of embodiment and agency is strongly correlated with their performance in these tasks. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems that leverage embodied cognition to enhance user experience and performance.
