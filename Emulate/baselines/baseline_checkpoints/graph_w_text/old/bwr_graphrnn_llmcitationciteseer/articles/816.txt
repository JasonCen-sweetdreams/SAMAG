In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'DTRL', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in dynamic environments. Our approach utilizes a novel, agent-centric state representation that captures local observations and global objectives, enabling agents to learn effective task allocation policies through self-play. Experimental results demonstrate that DTRL outperforms traditional, centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system utility, while also exhibiting robustness to agent failures and changes in task priorities.
