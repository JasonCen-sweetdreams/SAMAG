Resource allocation in cloud computing is a complex problem, especially with the increasing demand for on-demand services. This paper proposes a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning (DHRL) framework that optimizes resource allocation in cloud computing environments. Our approach consists of two hierarchical levels: a high-level policy network that allocates resources to virtual machines, and a low-level policy network that manages resource utilization within each virtual machine. We demonstrate that our DHRL approach outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods and Deep Q-Networks in terms of resource utilization, response time, and energy efficiency.
