Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective passage retrieval to locate relevant information from a massive corpus. We propose a neural query expansion approach, NQE, which learns to generate context-aware and topic-specific expansion terms. NQE leverages a combination of semantic and syntactic features to model the query and passage interactions, enabling more accurate passage retrieval. Experimental results on the SQuAD dataset demonstrate that NQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of passage retrieval accuracy and downstream question answering metrics.
