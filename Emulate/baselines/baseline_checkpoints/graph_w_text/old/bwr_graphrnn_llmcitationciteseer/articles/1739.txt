This paper introduces Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) for explainable multi-agent reinforcement learning. HANs learn to selectively focus on relevant agents, states, and actions to produce more interpretable and effective policies. We evaluate our approach on a range of cooperative and competitive multi-agent environments, demonstrating improved performance and transparency compared to existing methods. HANs provide a promising step towards more trustworthy and human-understandable AI systems.
