Entity disambiguation in knowledge graphs is a challenging task due to the complexity of semantic relationships between entities and their mentions. This paper presents a novel deep semantic ranking model, 'ESR', which leverages graph attention networks to capture contextual dependencies between entities and their attributes. We introduce a hierarchical ranking mechanism that jointly optimizes entity similarity and attribute relevance, resulting in improved disambiguation accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ESR in resolving entity ambiguities, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 12% in terms of F1-score.
