Multi-agent pathfinding is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence, with applications in robotics, video games, and autonomous vehicles. However, existing algorithms struggle with scalability as the number of agents increases. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'AdapGraph', which combines graph pruning with adaptive resolution adjustment to reduce computational overhead. We introduce a probabilistic pruning strategy that prioritizes high-traffic areas and dynamically adjusts the graph resolution based on agent density. Experimental results on large-scale grid worlds demonstrate that AdapGraph outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of computation time and solution quality.
