This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems, leveraging deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a hierarchical framework, 'AgentDRL', which enables agents to learn task assignments and adapt to dynamic environment changes. The framework consists of a centralized critic and decentralized actor networks, allowing agents to make decisions based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentDRL outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency, especially in large-scale scenarios.
