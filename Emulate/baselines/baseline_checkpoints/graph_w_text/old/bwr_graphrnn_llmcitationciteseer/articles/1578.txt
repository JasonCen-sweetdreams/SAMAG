This paper presents a novel approach to dynamic task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'DTRL-Agent', where autonomous agents learn to coordinate their actions and allocate tasks in real-time based on changing environmental conditions. Our method integrates graph neural networks with deep Q-networks to enable agents to reason about their joint actions and optimize overall system performance. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DTRL-Agent outperforms traditional task allocation algorithms in terms of response time, task completion rate, and adaptability to changing priorities.
