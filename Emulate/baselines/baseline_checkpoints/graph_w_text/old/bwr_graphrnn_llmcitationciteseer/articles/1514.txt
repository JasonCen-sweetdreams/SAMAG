This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to improve learning outcomes. We designed and evaluated a gestural interface that leverages users' bodily experiences to enhance retention and recall of abstract concepts. Our study with 120 participants shows that the embodied cognition-based interface outperforms traditional keyboard-and-mouse interfaces in learning gains and user engagement. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR-based educational systems and highlight future research directions.
