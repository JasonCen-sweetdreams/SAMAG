Recent advances in graph neural networks have led to improved performance in recommendation systems. However, existing methods often rely on homogeneous graphs, neglecting the complex relationships between users, items, and contextual information. This paper proposes a heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) framework that incorporates multiple types of nodes and edges to model these relationships. We leverage attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant aspects of the graph and provide explanations for the recommended items. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving recommendation accuracy and interpretability.
