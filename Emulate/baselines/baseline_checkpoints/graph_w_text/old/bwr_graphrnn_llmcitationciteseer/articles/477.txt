Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph patterns and the need to minimize communication overhead. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization, query rewriting, and adaptive join ordering to improve query performance. We evaluate GraphOpt on a range of real-world graph datasets and demonstrate significant speedups over state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
