Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR experiences. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR environment using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that users with personalized avatars demonstrated increased engagement, measured by time spent in the environment, and reported higher levels of presence and satisfaction. We also found that users' self-reported personality traits influenced their preferences for avatar customization. The findings have implications for the design of VR experiences, suggesting that personalized avatars can enhance user engagement and overall VR adoption.
