Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but it often relies on manual feature engineering and heuristics. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'RL-Expansion', that learns to select optimal expansion terms for a given query. By formulating query expansion as a Markov decision process, RL-Expansion leverages the strengths of DRL in exploring the vast space of possible expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-Expansion outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while requiring minimal human expertise and domain knowledge.
