This paper addresses the complex problem of decentralized task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We propose a novel framework, 'HRL-TA', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal task assignment policies. HRL-TA utilizes a hierarchical architecture to encode task and agent features, and a decentralized training protocol to adapt to changing environment conditions. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HRL-TA outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion efficiency and system adaptability.
