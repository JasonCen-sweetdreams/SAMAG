Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or incomplete queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. We introduce a multi-task learning framework that jointly learns query representation and relevance ranking. The framework utilizes a transformer-based architecture to model the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
