This paper presents a novel multi-agent system for real-time traffic flow optimization. Our approach leverages distributed learning and decentralized decision-making to optimize traffic signal control in complex urban networks. We propose a hybrid framework that combines model-based and model-free reinforcement learning strategies to adapt to changing traffic conditions. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulation platform demonstrate significant reductions in travel times and queue lengths compared to traditional optimization methods. Our system can be easily integrated with existing traffic management infrastructure, making it a promising solution for smart city applications.
