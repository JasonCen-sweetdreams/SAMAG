Distributed database systems face the challenge of optimizing query execution in a scalable and efficient manner. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query plans in distributed settings. We develop a query optimization framework, 'OptiQL', which utilizes a graph neural network to model the query optimization problem and learn effective optimization strategies from historical query workloads. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database system demonstrates that OptiQL achieves significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
