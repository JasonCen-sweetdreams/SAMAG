Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design a deep RL framework that learns to select efficient query plans based on runtime feedback. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 3x improvement in query execution time compared to traditional optimization techniques.
