Ad-hoc retrieval, a fundamental task in information retrieval, aims to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. However, the limited query context often leads to poor retrieval performance. We propose a novel query expansion framework, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. Our approach incorporates a multi-task learning objective that jointly optimizes query expansion and relevance ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
