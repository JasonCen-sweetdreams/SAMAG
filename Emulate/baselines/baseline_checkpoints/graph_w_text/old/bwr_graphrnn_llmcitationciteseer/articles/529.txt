Traffic congestion is a ubiquitous problem in urban areas, and traditional approaches often rely on static traffic signal control. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent system that leverages distributed reinforcement learning to coordinate traffic signals in real-time. Our approach, called 'TrafficMA', enables agents to learn from local observations and adjust their signal control strategies to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. We evaluate TrafficMA on a realistic traffic simulation platform and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing traffic patterns and outperform traditional control methods.
