Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. However, traditional indexing techniques fail to meet the performance requirements of real-time data warehousing. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, 'RT-Index', that leverages a combination of column-store indexing and in-memory caching to achieve efficient query processing. We evaluate RT-Index on a synthetic dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing indexing techniques, including a 3x reduction in query response time and a 2x increase in throughput.
