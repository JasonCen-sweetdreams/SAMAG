Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide transparent and trustworthy recommendations. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework for ERS, which integrates graph Attention mechanisms with hierarchical representation learning. HGAT captures complex user-item relationships by recursively applying attention at multiple scales, thereby providing more accurate and explainable recommendations. We evaluate HGAT on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
