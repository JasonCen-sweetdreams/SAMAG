Dynamic networks, where nodes and edges change over time, are ubiquitous in real-world applications such as social networks, traffic patterns, and biological systems. Node classification in these networks is challenging due to the temporal dependencies and complex relationships between nodes. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and time steps. HGAT consists of two stages: a node-level attention module that aggregates features from neighboring nodes, and a graph-level attention module that integrates information across time steps. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks, especially in scenarios with significant temporal changes.
