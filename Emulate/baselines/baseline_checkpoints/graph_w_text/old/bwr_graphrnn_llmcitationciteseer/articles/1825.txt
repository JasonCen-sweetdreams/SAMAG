Proximity-based retrieval is a fundamental task in many information retrieval applications, but it becomes increasingly challenging in high-dimensional spaces. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, called Hierarchical Projection Tree (HPT), which efficiently prunes the search space to reduce the number of distance computations. Our approach combines a hierarchical clustering strategy with a projection-based indexing scheme, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of nearest neighbors. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of query time and memory efficiency.
