Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the inherent complexity of human emotions and the presence of noisy or ambiguous data. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features, thereby improving emotion recognition accuracy and providing explainability. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers and a hierarchical fusion mechanism, which adaptively weights the importance of each modality. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of emotion recognition accuracy and provides insightful visualizations of the attention patterns.
