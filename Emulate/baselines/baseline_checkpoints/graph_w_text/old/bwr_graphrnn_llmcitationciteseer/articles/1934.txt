Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query performance in distributed database systems. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize query execution plans based on the system's workload and performance metrics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
