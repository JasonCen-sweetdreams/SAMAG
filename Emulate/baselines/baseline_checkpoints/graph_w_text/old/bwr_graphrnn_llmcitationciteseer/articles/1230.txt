In collaborative virtual environments, efficient task allocation is crucial for productivity and user experience. This paper presents an innovative approach that leverages eye-gaze tracking to adaptively allocate tasks based on individuals' expertise and attention. Our system, 'GazeTask', uses machine learning-based gaze analysis to identify areas of interest and infer user intentions. We evaluate GazeTask in a user study with 20 participants and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional role-based allocation methods.
