Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that integrates item-level and user-level graph attention mechanisms to provide personalized explanations for recommendations. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model complex relationships between users and items, and incorporates attention weights to highlight influential factors in the recommendation process. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
