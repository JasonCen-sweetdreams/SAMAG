Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder affecting articulation, often struggle to interact with these systems. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasySpeak', a novel voice assistant tailored to the needs of individuals with dysarthria. We employ a user-centered approach, incorporating feedback from individuals with dysarthria and speech therapists to develop an interface that accommodates their unique communication patterns. Our evaluation shows that EasySpeak significantly improves the interaction experience, reducing error rates and increasing user satisfaction. We contribute to the development of more inclusive and accessible voice assistants.
