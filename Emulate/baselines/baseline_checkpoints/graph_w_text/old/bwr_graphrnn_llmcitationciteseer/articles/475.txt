Traditional ranking models for document retrieval often suffer from high computational costs and limited context-awareness. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HNRM', which leverages a two-stage ranking architecture to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. The first stage uses a lightweight neural network to filter out irrelevant documents, while the second stage employs a more complex, contextualized ranking model to refine the ranking. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HNRM achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational costs by up to 40% compared to existing neural ranking models.
