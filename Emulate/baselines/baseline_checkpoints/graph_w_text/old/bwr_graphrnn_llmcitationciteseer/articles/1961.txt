As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding how humans interact with robots in these environments is crucial. This paper investigates the effect of embodiment on human-robot collaboration in VR. We conducted a user study where participants worked with a robot to complete a series of tasks in a virtual environment, either with or without embodiment (i.e., a virtual avatar). Our results show that embodiment significantly improves collaboration outcomes, including task completion time and user satisfaction. We also found that embodiment increases the sense of agency and trust towards the robot. Our findings have implications for the design of future human-robot collaboration systems in VR.
