Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user experience is heavily influenced by the sense of embodiment in virtual environments. This study investigates the effects of personalized avatar embodiment on user experience in VR, with a focus on self-representation, agency, and spatial awareness. Our user study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative measures of performance and presence with qualitative feedback. Results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance user experience, particularly for women and individuals with low VR familiarity. Our findings have implications for the design of inclusive and engaging VR applications.
