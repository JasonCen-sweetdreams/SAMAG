Distributed database systems are increasingly being used to handle large-scale data processing. Query optimization is a critical component of these systems, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of the system. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization approach using reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'QOptRL', uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn the optimal query plan for a given query. We evaluate QOptRL on a real-world dataset and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by an average of 30%. We also demonstrate the adaptability of QOptRL to changing database workloads and query patterns.
