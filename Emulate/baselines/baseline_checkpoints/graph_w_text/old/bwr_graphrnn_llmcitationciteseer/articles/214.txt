Ad-hoc retrieval has seen significant improvements with the advent of neural ranking models. However, query expansion remains a crucial step in enhancing retrieval effectiveness. This paper presents a novel neural re-ranking approach, 'NeuQE', which integrates query expansion into the ranking process. NeuQE leverages a transformer-based architecture to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents, generating an expanded query representation that is fine-tuned for the target retrieval task. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 datasets demonstrate that NeuQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
