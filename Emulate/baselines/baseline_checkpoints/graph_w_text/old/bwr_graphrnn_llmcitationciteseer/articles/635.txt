In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem that requires coordinating agents to achieve complex goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning to improve scalability and adaptability. Our approach enables agents to learn high-level task assignments and low-level action policies simultaneously, while respecting resource constraints and facilitating real-time adaptation to changing task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing overall system latency.
