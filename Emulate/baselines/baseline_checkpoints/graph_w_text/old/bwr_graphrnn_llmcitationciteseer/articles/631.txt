Multi-agent systems often rely on complex decision-making processes, which can be difficult to interpret and explain. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent environments. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, generating interpretable explanations for the decision-making process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of multi-agent scenarios, including traffic management and smart grids.
