Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We propose an RL-based framework that learns to optimize query plans based on the database's workload and system dynamics. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and resource utilization. We also show that our framework can adapt to changing workload patterns and system configurations, making it a promising solution for real-world distributed database systems.
