Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) has become a critical component of modern business intelligence, but query optimization remains a major bottleneck. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query execution plans in RTDW systems. We propose a hybrid model that combines graph neural networks with traditional query optimization techniques to predict optimal execution plans. Our experiments on a large-scale RTDW benchmark show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time, while reducing resource utilization by up to 25%.
