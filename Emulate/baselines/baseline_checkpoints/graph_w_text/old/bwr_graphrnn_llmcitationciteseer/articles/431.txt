Coordinating multiple agents to achieve a common goal is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. Existing approaches often rely on complex models that lack interpretability, hindering trust and understanding in real-world applications. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) framework that enables explainable cooperation among agents. HAN employs a hierarchical structure to model agent relationships and incorporates attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant information. Our experiments on a range of multi-agent scenarios demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while providing transparent and interpretable decision-making processes.
