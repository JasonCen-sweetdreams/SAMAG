Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when faced with novel classes and limited data. This paper introduces a meta-learning approach that leverages hierarchical task embeddings to capture task relationships and facilitate knowledge transfer. Our proposed framework, Hierarchical Task Embeddings for Meta-Learning (HTEM), learns to represent tasks as a hierarchy of embeddings, enabling the model to generalize to new tasks with fewer shots. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HTEM outperforms state-of-the-art meta-learning methods, achieving significant improvements in few-shot classification accuracy.
