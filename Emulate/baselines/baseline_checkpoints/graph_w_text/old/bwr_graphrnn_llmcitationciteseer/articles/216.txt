This paper addresses the challenge of coordinating multi-agent systems in autonomous traffic management, where individual agents may have conflicting objectives. We propose a novel incentive mechanism that leverages game-theoretic concepts to align agent behaviors with system-wide goals. Our approach, called 'CoopRoute', incorporates a reputation system and adaptive pricing to encourage cooperation among agents. Experimental results using real-world traffic data demonstrate that CoopRoute reduces congestion and travel times by up to 30% compared to traditional optimization methods, while promoting fairness and efficiency in the allocation of road resources.
