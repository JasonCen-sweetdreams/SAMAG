Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in DDS remains a complex and time-consuming task. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RL-QOpt', that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in DDS. Our approach uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the system's workload and resource utilization. We evaluate RL-QOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
