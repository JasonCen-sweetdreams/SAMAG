Few-shot relation classification (FSRC) aims to classify relationships between entities in a sentence with limited labeled data. Existing graph-based methods suffer from over-smoothing and neglect the hierarchical structure of relations. We propose HAGCN, a novel hierarchical attention graph convolutional network that adaptively learns to focus on relevant entities and relations. Our model consists of a graph attention encoder and a hierarchical relation encoder, which captures both local and global contextual information. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that HAGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3% on average, demonstrating its effectiveness in FSRC tasks.
