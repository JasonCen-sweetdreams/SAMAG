Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval (IR), where the goal is to rank documents based on their relevance to a given query. While neural ranking models have shown promising results, they often rely on simple query representations and ignore the underlying query structure. This paper proposes a novel neural query graph attention (NQGA) framework, which models queries as graphs and incorporates attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant query components. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NQGA on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
