Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in ad-hoc search tasks, but their performance is often limited by the quality of the input query. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'NeuQE', which leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and documents in the collection. We introduce a graph-based neural network that captures the contextual information of query terms and generates an expanded query set. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that NeuQE improves the retrieval performance of state-of-the-art neural models, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
