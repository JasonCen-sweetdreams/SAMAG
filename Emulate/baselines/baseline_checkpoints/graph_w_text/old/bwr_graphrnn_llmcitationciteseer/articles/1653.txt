Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a question. This paper proposes a novel passage retrieval framework that leverages hierarchical attention and entity disambiguation to improve the accuracy and efficiency of ODQA systems. Our approach uses a coarse-to-fine hierarchical attention mechanism to focus on relevant sentences and entities within passages, and incorporates entity disambiguation to resolve ambiguity in entity mentions. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset show that our approach achieves a 15% improvement in passage retrieval accuracy and a 30% reduction in computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods.
