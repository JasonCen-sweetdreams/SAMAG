This paper presents a novel approach to cooperative task allocation in multi-agent systems, leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model complex agent interactions. We formulate the task allocation problem as a graph optimization problem, where agents are represented as nodes and their capabilities as node features. Our proposed GCN-based algorithm, called GraphTask, learns to identify optimal task assignments by jointly reasoning about agent capabilities, task requirements, and the underlying communication network. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that GraphTask outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time, communication overhead, and robustness to agent failures.
