Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in such systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution times. Our approach is scalable and can handle complex query workloads. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x.
