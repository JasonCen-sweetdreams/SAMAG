Query intent identification is a crucial task in information retrieval, enabling search engines to provide more accurate and relevant results. However, existing approaches rely heavily on manual annotations and struggle to generalize to new domains. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised framework, 'GraphIntent', which leverages deep graph neural networks to model the structural relationships between query terms and their intents. We evaluate GraphIntent on a large-scale dataset of search queries and demonstrate significant improvements in intent identification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
