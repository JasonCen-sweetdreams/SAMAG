The complexity of modern search queries poses significant challenges to traditional document retrieval systems. This paper presents a novel approach to deep query reformulation, which leverages a hierarchical transformer-based architecture to recursively refine and expand user queries. Our method, dubbed 'QueryRefine', incorporates semantic role labeling and entity disambiguation to better capture the nuances of user intent. Experimental results on the TREC-2022 dataset demonstrate that QueryRefine achieves substantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
