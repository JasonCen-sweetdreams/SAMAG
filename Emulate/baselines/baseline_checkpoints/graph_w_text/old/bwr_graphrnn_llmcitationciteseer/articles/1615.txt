Distributed databases are increasingly used to store and process large amounts of data, but efficient indexing for multi-dimensional range queries remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'DRIQUE', which leverages a hierarchical clustering approach to minimize query latency and reduce network communication overhead. We evaluate DRIQUE on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing indexing methods, achieving up to 3x faster query response times and 2x lower network traffic.
