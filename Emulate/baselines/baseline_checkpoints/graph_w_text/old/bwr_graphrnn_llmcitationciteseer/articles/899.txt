Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their usability for older adults is often limited by speech recognition errors and confusing conversational flows. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, analyzing their speech patterns, conversational preferences, and interaction experiences. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant prototype that incorporates adaptive speech recognition, simplified conversational flows, and personalized feedback mechanisms. Results show significant improvements in task completion rates, user satisfaction, and perceived cognitive load.
