The rapid growth of digital data has led to an increased demand for efficient and scalable information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel document indexing approach using hierarchical neural networks, which leverages the strengths of both traditional term-frequency based methods and deep learning-based techniques. Our proposed model, 'HierIndex', learns to represent documents as hierarchical embeddings, enabling efficient similarity search and retrieval. Experimental results on several large-scale datasets demonstrate that HierIndex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of query response time and retrieval accuracy, while reducing the storage requirements by up to 50%.
