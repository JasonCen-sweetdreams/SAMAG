Virtual Reality (VR) systems rely heavily on visual cues, but haptic feedback can significantly enhance user immersion and engagement. This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive haptic feedback in VR, which leverages machine learning to personalize the feedback based on individual user preferences and behavioral patterns. Our approach incorporates a probabilistic model of user response to different haptic stimuli, allowing the system to dynamically adjust the feedback intensity and frequency in real-time. We evaluate our approach through a user study, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction and task performance compared to traditional, static haptic feedback methods.
