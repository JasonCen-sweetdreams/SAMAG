Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various applications, but most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based neural network (HATN) that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights. HATN employs a multi-level attention mechanism to capture local and global patterns in time series data, and a gradient-based attribution method to highlight the most relevant features contributing to the anomaly score. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance and explainability of HATN compared to state-of-the-art methods.
