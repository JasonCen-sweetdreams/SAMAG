Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often fail to consider the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to creating inclusive VR experiences for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and healthcare professionals to identify key design principles and recommendations. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, feedback, and social interaction in VR experiences for this population. We also developed and evaluated a prototype VR system that incorporates these principles, demonstrating improved usability and engagement among older adults with cognitive impairments.
