Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but designing intuitive user interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interface framework for VR environments, which leverages machine learning and computer vision to recognize and interpret user gestures. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, comparing it to traditional controller-based interfaces. Results show that our gesture-based interface significantly improves user experience, reducing cognitive load and increasing task completion rates. We also provide guidelines for designers to create more intuitive and user-friendly VR interfaces.
