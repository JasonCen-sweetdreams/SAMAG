In complex systems, coordinating autonomous agents to optimize resource allocation is a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to train agents to negotiate and coordinate their actions. We introduce a multi-agent deep Q-network (MA-DQN) framework that enables agents to learn effective negotiation strategies and allocate resources efficiently. Experimental results on a simulated grid system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization methods and achieves near-optimal resource allocation. We also analyze the robustness of our approach under varying system dynamics and agent behaviors.
