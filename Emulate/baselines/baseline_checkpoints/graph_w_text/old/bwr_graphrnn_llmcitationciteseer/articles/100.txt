Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide transparent and trustworthy recommendations. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to generate explanations for recommendations. HGAT captures complex item relationships and user preferences by learning hierarchical representations of items and users. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
