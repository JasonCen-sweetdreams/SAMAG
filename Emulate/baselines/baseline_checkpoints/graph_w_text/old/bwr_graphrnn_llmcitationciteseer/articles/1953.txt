 Gesture recognition systems have the potential to improve the lives of older adults with dementia by enabling them to interact with technology in a more natural way. However, existing systems often fail to account for the cognitive and motor impairments associated with dementia. This paper presents a novel approach to designing inclusive gesture recognition systems that accommodate the needs of older adults with dementia. We propose a user-centered design methodology that incorporates input from caregivers, clinicians, and individuals with dementia. Our approach involves a hierarchical gesture recognition model that can adapt to individual differences in gesture patterns and abilities. We evaluate our system using a dataset of gestures collected from older adults with dementia and demonstrate improved recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
