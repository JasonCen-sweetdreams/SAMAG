This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to improve user experience. We designed a gesture-based interaction system that leverages the neural coupling between motor control and cognitive processes. A user study with 30 participants revealed that our system enhances spatial awareness, reduces cognitive load, and increases overall engagement in VR applications. Our findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and immersive VR interfaces, and demonstrate the potential of embodied cognition to inform human-computer interaction.
