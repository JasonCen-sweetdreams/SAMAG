E-commerce search engines rely heavily on query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. However, traditional methods often suffer from high computational costs and limited domain adaptability. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion framework, 'NeuroXPand', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate dense embeddings for query terms and documents. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively incorporate expansion terms based on their relevance to the original query. Experiments on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that NeuroXPand achieves significant improvements in mean average precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computational overhead by an order of magnitude.
