This paper introduces HAN-MAD, a novel hierarchical attention network architecture for explainable decision making in multi-agent systems. By leveraging attention mechanisms at both local and global levels, HAN-MAD effectively captures complex interactions and relationships between agents. We demonstrate the efficacy of HAN-MAD in a real-world autonomous driving scenario, showcasing improved decision-making transparency and a reduction in collisions by 23.1%. Our approach opens up new avenues for explainable AI in safety-critical multi-agent applications.
