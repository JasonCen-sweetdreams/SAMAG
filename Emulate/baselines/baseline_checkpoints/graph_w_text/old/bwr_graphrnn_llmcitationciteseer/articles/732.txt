Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and high concurrency. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans based on runtime statistics and system workload. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based optimization methods by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
