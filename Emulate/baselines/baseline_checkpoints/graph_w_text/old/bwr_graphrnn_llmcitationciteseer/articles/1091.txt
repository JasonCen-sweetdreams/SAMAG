Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework that leverages latent semantic analysis (LSA) to enrich the query representation. Our approach, called 'NeuroLSA', employs a deep neural network to learn a dense, low-dimensional representation of the query, which is then expanded using LSA to incorporate related concepts. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that NeuroLSA outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG).
