Virtual reality (VR) has seen significant advancements in recent years, but the impact of personalized avatars on user experience remains poorly understood. This study investigates how customizable avatars affect user engagement, presence, and emotional response in VR environments. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 120 participants, exploring the effects of avatar personalization on user behavior, self-reported experience, and physiological responses. Our results suggest that personalized avatars significantly enhance user experience, particularly for individuals with high self-identification with their avatar. We discuss the implications for VR application design and provide guidelines for effective avatar personalization.
