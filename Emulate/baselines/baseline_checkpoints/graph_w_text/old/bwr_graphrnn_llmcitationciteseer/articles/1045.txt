With the increasing adoption of AI-driven systems in critical infrastructure, there is a growing need for explainable anomaly detection in time series data. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that leverages both local and global context to identify anomalies. Our approach incorporates a self-attention mechanism to weight the importance of different segments in the time series, enabling the model to focus on relevant patterns and relationships. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that our HAN model outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of detection accuracy and provides interpretable explanations for its predictions.
