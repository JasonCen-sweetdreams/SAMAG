Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data analysis, but existing methods often struggle with scalability. We introduce Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework that leverages hierarchical graph representations to reduce computational complexity. By recursively applying graph attention mechanisms, HGAT captures rich node features and contextual relationships at multiple scales. Our experiments on large-scale graph benchmarks demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.
