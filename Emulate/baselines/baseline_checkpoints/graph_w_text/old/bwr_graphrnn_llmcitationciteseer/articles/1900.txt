Distributed database systems face significant performance challenges due to the complexity of query optimization. Recently, learned index structures have shown promise in improving query performance in centralized databases. This paper explores the application of learned index structures in distributed database systems, proposing a novel framework that leverages query workload patterns to optimize index creation and placement. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in query response times and throughput, making our approach a promising solution for large-scale data processing.
