Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to enhance the query representation by adding relevant terms. Traditional approaches rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages neural networks to learn query expansion representations from large-scale query logs. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, with significant improvements in precision and recall.
