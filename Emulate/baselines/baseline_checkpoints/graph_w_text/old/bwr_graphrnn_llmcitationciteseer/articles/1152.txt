Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR-based learning environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a VR-based educational scenario. Results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars reported higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and learning satisfaction compared to those who interacted with generic avatars. We also found that personalized avatars increased user engagement by an average of 30%. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based learning systems and highlight the importance of user-centered design in HCI.
