Knowledge graph embeddings have become a crucial component in various AI applications. However, the presence of ambiguous entities in these graphs can lead to inaccurate representations. This paper proposes a novel context-aware entity disambiguation approach, 'CAED', which leverages both semantic and structural information to resolve entity ambiguities. CAED incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to weigh the importance of neighboring entities and their relationships, enabling more accurate disambiguation. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAED outperforms state-of-the-art disambiguation methods, resulting in improved knowledge graph embedding quality and downstream task performance.
