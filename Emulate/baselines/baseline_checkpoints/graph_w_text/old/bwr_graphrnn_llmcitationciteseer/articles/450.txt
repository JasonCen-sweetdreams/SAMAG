Distributed information retrieval systems have become essential for handling large-scale data. However, query processing remains a bottleneck due to the overhead of scattered data retrieval. This paper presents a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HIQ', which optimizes query efficiency in distributed IR systems. HIQ employs a two-level indexing strategy, where a global index is used to prune irrelevant nodes, and a local index is utilized for efficient document retrieval. Our experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HIQ reduces query latency by up to 40% and improves retrieval accuracy by 12% compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
