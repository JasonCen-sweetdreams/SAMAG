As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to investigate the role of embodiment in shaping user experience. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the relationship between gesture recognition, embodiment, and user experience in VR environments. We designed and implemented a VR platform that tracks user gestures and provides real-time feedback, and conducted a user study with 40 participants. Our results show that users who experienced a higher sense of embodiment, characterized by greater gesture recognition accuracy and self-reported presence, reported higher levels of engagement and overall user experience. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems that prioritize user embodiment and experience.
