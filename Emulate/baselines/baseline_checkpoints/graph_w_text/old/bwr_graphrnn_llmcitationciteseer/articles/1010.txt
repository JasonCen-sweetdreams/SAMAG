As the population ages, designing accessible conversational interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments becomes increasingly important. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing a conversational agent that accommodates the needs of this demographic. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults with cognitive impairments and caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our findings informed the development of a prototype interface that incorporates simplicity, consistency, and multimodal feedback. Evaluation results show that our design significantly improves user experience and reduces cognitive load compared to existing conversational interfaces.
