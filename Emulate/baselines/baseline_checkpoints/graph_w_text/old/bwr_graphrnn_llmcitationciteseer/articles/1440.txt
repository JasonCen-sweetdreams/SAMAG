Distributed resource allocation problems are ubiquitous in modern systems, but current solutions often rely on centralized optimization or simple heuristics. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARLA', which enables decentralized decision-making in large-scale systems. MARLA leverages graph neural networks to model complex dependencies between agents and resources, and employs a hybrid exploration strategy to balance short-term rewards with long-term system efficiency. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate that MARLA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of resource utilization, energy efficiency, and adaptability to changing system conditions.
