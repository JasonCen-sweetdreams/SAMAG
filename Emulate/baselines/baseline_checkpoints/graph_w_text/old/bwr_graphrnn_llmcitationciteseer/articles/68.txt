Emotion recognition from multi-modal data (e.g., text, audio, vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features for emotion recognition. Our HAN architecture consists of three levels of attention: modality-level, feature-level, and instance-level. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications.
