Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'NeuroExpand', which leverages the representational power of neural networks to learn query expansion strategies. Our method uses a combination of word embeddings and attention mechanisms to identify relevant expansion terms, and experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional techniques. We also analyze the interpretability of our model, providing insights into the learned expansion strategies.
