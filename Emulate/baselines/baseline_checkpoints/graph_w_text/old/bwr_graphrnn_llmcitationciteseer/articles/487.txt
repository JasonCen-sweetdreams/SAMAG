Distributed relational databases (DRDBs) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in DRDBs remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving feedback in the form of execution times. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset show that the RL-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
