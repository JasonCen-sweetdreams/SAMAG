Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. We introduce a multi-level attention mechanism that captures both item-level and user-level interactions, leading to improved recommendation accuracy and explanation quality. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in generating interpretable recommendations compared to state-of-the-art models.
