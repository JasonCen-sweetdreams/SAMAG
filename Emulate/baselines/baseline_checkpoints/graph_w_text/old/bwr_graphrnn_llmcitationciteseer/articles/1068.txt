Virtual reality (VR) technology has significant potential for older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing interfaces often exacerbate cognitive load and accessibility barriers. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving cognitive assessments, user interviews, and usability testing to inform the development of our VR system, 'EASE'. EASE incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified navigation, error forgiveness, and visual cues, to facilitate engagement and enjoyment. Our evaluation with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments demonstrates improved user experience, reduced frustration, and enhanced cognitive accessibility in VR.
