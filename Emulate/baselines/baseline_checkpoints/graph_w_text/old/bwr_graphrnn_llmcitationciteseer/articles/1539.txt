Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized social interactions, but the lack of embodied avatars hinders social presence and empathy. This paper presents 'AvatarCraft', a novel framework for designing embodied avatars that incorporate nonverbal cues, gestures, and facial expressions. We conducted a user study to evaluate the impact of AvatarCraft on social presence, trust, and emotional contagion in VR-based social interactions. Results show that participants perceived avatars designed with AvatarCraft as more lifelike, trustworthy, and empathetic, leading to enhanced social presence and emotional connection.
