Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing environments, where multiple organizations share a common database infrastructure. However, optimizing query performance in such systems is challenging due to the varying workload and resource requirements of each tenant. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning-based workload forecasting and adaptive resource allocation to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world multi-tenant database system demonstrates significant performance improvements compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
