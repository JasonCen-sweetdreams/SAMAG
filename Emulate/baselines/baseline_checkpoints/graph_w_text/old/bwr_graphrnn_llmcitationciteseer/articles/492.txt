Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages word embeddings to enrich the semantic representation of query terms. Our method, dubbed 'EmbEx', combines the strengths of traditional lexical expansion techniques with the contextualized embeddings of BERT-based models. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that EmbEx significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
