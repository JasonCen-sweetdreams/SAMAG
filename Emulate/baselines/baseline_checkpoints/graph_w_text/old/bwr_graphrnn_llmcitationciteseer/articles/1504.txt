Distributed database systems pose significant challenges in query optimization due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We represent the database schema and query plans as graphs and leverage GNNs to learn a distributed query optimization strategy. Our approach, called 'DistributedQueryOpt', outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of execution time and resource utilization. We evaluate our approach on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate its efficacy in reducing query execution time by up to 30%.
