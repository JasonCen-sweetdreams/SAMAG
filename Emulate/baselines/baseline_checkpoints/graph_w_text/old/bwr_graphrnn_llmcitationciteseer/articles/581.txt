In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize task assignments in real-time. Our approach, called 'MA-DRL', consists of a decentralized DRL algorithm that enables each agent to learn its own policy for task selection and allocation. We evaluate MA-DRL in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional, centralized allocation methods.
