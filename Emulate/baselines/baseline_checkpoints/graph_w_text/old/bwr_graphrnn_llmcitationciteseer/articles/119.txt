Existing multi-agent decision-making approaches often rely on centralized controllers or complex communication protocols, which can be difficult to interpret and scale. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent systems. Our HAN model incorporates attention mechanisms at both the local and global levels, allowing agents to selectively focus on relevant information and communicate effectively. We evaluate our approach on a cooperative game-playing task and demonstrate improved performance and interpretability compared to existing methods.
