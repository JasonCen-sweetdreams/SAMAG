Multi-tenant database systems are increasingly popular, but optimizing queries for multiple tenants poses significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for multi-tenant workloads. Our method, 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the observed system state and workload characteristics. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database system show that RL-QOpt significantly outperforms traditional optimization techniques, achieving up to 3x improvement in query response times and 2x reduction in resource utilization.
