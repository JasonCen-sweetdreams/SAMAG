Effective cooperation among multiple agents in complex environments requires transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network architecture, 'HANA', which enables explainable coordination among multiple agents. HANA leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their intentions, facilitating more accurate and interpretable joint action prediction. Experimental results on a simulated robotic soccer domain demonstrate that HANA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of cooperation success rate and explainability metrics.
