Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR environment using either a generic or personalized avatar, and measured their engagement, satisfaction, and cognitive load. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement and satisfaction, while reducing cognitive load. We also found that users with personalized avatars exhibit more social behavior and are more likely to form a sense of presence in the virtual environment.
