In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach represents the agent-task interactio ns as a graph and leverages GNNs to learn a distributed task allocation policy. We introduce a novel message-passing scheme that enables agents to share information and make decisions in a decentralized manner. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
