Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments often face significant barriers to accessing VR experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interactions, focusing on haptic feedback and audio cues to facilitate navigation and object recognition. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with visual impairments, demonstrating improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-centric VR designs. Our findings inform the development of inclusive VR experiences that can benefit a broader range of users.
