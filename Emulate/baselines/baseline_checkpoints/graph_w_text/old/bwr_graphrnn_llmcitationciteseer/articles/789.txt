Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing effective user interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effects of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, using a custom-built VR platform that incorporated machine learning-based avatar personalization. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars reported higher levels of engagement, satisfaction, and self-presence compared to those using generic avatars. We also identified significant correlations between avatar personalization and user behavior, including reduced navigation errors and increased exploration of virtual environments.
