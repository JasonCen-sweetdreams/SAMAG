Distributed database systems have become ubiquitous in modern data-intensive applications. However, query performance remains a major bottleneck due to data replication and consistency issues. This paper presents 'AdaptRep', a novel adaptive replication strategy that dynamically adjusts data placement and replication factors based on query patterns and system workload. Our approach leverages machine learning-based query forecasting and graph-based data placement optimization to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. Experimental evaluations on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AdaptRep outperforms state-of-the-art replication strategies by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
