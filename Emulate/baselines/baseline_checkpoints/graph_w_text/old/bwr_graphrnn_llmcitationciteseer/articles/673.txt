Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships. However, as graph sizes continue to grow, query optimization techniques struggle to keep pace. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, GraphIX, which leverages a combination of graph summarization and adaptive query rewriting to significantly reduce query latency. We demonstrate that GraphIX outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods on large-scale graph datasets, achieving up to 5x speedup on complex graph queries.
