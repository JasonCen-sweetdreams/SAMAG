Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing complex queries on these systems remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph decomposition, join ordering, and adaptive indexing to minimize query execution time. Our experiments on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x, while providing robustness to varying query workloads and system configurations.
