With the increasing adoption of distributed databases, efficient query optimization techniques are crucial to ensure high performance and consistency. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework for multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) in distributed databases. We propose a dynamic query rewriting approach that leverages transactional dependencies to reduce conflicts and improve query throughput. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world e-commerce dataset shows that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 35% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of throughput.
