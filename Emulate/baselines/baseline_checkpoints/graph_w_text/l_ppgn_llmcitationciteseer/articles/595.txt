The increasing complexity of IoT networks demands efficient resource allocation strategies to ensure reliable and real-time task execution. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent framework, 'MARIA', that enables scalable cooperation among agents to optimize resource allocation. We develop a distributed negotiation protocol that leverages semantic reasoning and distributed constraint satisfaction to allocate resources in a decentralized manner. Experimental results on a real-world IoT testbed demonstrate that MARIA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of response time, resource utilization, and adaptability to dynamic network conditions.
