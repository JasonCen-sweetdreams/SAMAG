Gestural interfaces have become increasingly prevalent in modern computing, but individuals with motor impairments often face significant barriers to using these systems. This paper presents a novel design framework for creating inclusive gestural interfaces that accommodate diverse motor abilities. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 participants with motor impairments, resulting in a set of design principles and guidelines for developing accessible gestural interactions. We also developed and evaluated a prototype system that incorporates these principles, demonstrating improved usability and accessibility for participants with motor impairments.
