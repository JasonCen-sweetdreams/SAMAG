Query expansion (QE) is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) to improve the retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. However, existing QE methods often rely on simplistic term-weighting schemes, overlooking the underlying topic structure of the documents. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, Hierarchical Topic-based Query Expansion (HTQE), which leverages hierarchical topic modeling to capture the semantic relationships between terms and documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HTQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness.
