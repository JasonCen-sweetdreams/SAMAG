View maintenance is a crucial task in graph databases, as it enables efficient query answering over dynamic graph data. Existing solutions often suffer from high computational overhead and data staleness. In this paper, we introduce 'GraphView', an incremental view maintenance approach that leverages graph structural properties to minimize recomputation. GraphView employs a novel delta-based maintenance strategy, which adaptively updates views based on the frequency and locality of graph updates. Our experiments on various graph datasets demonstrate that GraphView outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by up to 3x in terms of maintenance time and reduces data staleness by 50%.
