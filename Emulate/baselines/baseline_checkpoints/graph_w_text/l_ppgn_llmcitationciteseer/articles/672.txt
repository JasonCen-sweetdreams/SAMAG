State-of-the-art information retrieval models rely heavily on manually crafted features and complex ranking architectures. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Document Ranking (HGNN-DR), which leverages the graph structure of documents to learn hierarchical representations. HGNN-DR adapts graph attention mechanisms to capture local and global document relationships, achieving improved ranking performance and reduced computational complexity. Experimental results on the TREC news dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HGNN-DR in retrieving relevant documents, outperforming existing neural ranking models.
