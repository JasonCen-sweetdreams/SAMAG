Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights. Our model leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture complex patterns at multiple scales and focuses on the most relevant segments of the time series. We evaluate HAN on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting anomalies while outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of explainability.
