Distributed relational databases are increasingly popular due to their ability to scale horizontally. However, optimizing query execution plans in such systems remains a complex problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed relational databases. Our method, called 'Distributed Query Optimizer' (DQO), uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database's workload and system configuration. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DQO outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
