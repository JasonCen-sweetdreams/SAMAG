Voice-based virtual assistants (VAs) have become ubiquitous, but their accessibility features often fail to account for diverse user needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing inclusive accessibility features for VAs. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with disabilities to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our results inform the design of 'VAce', a VA platform that incorporates personalized accommodations, such as real-time transcription, speech rate adjustment, and multimodal feedback. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
