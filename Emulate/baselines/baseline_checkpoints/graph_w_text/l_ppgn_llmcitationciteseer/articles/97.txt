Modern information retrieval systems rely on neural ranking models to improve document retrieval efficiency. However, these models often struggle with large document collections and limited computational resources. We propose a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HierRank', which leverages a multi-level document representation to reduce computational complexity. Our approach first employs a lightweight ranking model to filter out irrelevant documents, and then applies a more accurate but computationally expensive model to the remaining candidates. Experimental results on the TREC-500 dataset demonstrate that HierRank achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational cost by up to 50% compared to existing neural ranking models.
