Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant evidence for answer extraction. This paper introduces Hierarchical Neural Ranking (HNR), a novel retrieval framework that leverages a hierarchical representation of passages to improve retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. HNR first uses a coarse-grained neural ranker to filter out irrelevant passages, followed by a fine-grained ranker that refines the ranking using semantic similarity. Experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HNR outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods, achieving a 15% increase in retrieval accuracy while reducing computational overhead by 30%.
