Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the retrieval performance. Existing methods rely on heuristics or manual tuning, which may not adapt well to diverse query types and collections. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework, 'QL-Expander', that learns to optimize query expansion dynamically. The agent learns to select the most informative terms to add to the query, taking into account the feedback from the retrieval system. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that QL-Expander outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in retrieval effectiveness.
