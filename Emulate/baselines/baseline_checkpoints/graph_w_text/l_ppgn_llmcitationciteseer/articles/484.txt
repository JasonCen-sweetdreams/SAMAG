Virtual reality (VR) systems have the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience and engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, analyzing their behavioral and physiological responses to customized avatars. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and perceived control, leading to increased engagement and reduced cybersickness. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems and potential applications in education, therapy, and entertainment.
