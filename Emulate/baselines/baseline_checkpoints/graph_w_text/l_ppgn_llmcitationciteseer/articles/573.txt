Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing complex relationships between data entities. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal query plans based on a reward function that balances query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a large-scale graph database benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of resource efficiency.
