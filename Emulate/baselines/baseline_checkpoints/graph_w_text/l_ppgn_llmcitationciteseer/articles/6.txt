Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-based machine learning, but existing methods often struggle with noisy or incomplete graph structures. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages multi-scale graph representations to improve robustness. HGAN recursively applies graph attention mechanisms at different scales, allowing it to capture both local and global structural patterns. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification accuracy, especially in the presence of noisy or missing edges.
