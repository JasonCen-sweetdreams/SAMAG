Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of query execution plans and the dynamic nature of data distributions. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict optimal query execution plans by interacting with the database environment. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
