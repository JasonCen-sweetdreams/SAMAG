Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, dubbed 'DeepQE', which leverages a encoder-decoder architecture to generate expanded query representations. Our approach not only outperforms traditional query expansion methods but also reduces the computational overhead associated with filtering large document collections. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that DeepQE achieves significant improvements in precision and recall, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
