Materialized views (MVs) are a crucial optimization technique in distributed database systems, as they enable fast query execution by pre-computing and storing intermediate results. However, maintaining MVs in the presence of frequent data updates is a challenging task. This paper presents a novel approach, called 'DynViews', which leverages incremental view maintenance and adaptive sampling to minimize the overhead of MV updates. Our experimental evaluation on a distributed database system demonstrates that DynViews reduces maintenance costs by up to 70% compared to traditional recomputation-based approaches, while ensuring data freshness and consistency.
