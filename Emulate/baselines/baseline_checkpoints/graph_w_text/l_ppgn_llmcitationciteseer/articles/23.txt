Predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is a crucial task in computational biology. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results, but they often struggle with complex graph structures and limited labeled data. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant subgraphs and proteins. HGAT consists of two stages: a graph attention module that identifies key proteins and a hierarchical pooling module that aggregates node features. We evaluate HGAT on several PPI benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average AUC-ROC of 0.953. Our results highlight the potential of HGAT for PPI prediction and its applications in drug discovery and disease diagnosis.
