This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We propose a graph neural network (GNN) architecture that learns to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, workload, and communication constraints. Our approach is scalable, robust, and adaptive to changes in the agent population or task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional optimization-based methods.
