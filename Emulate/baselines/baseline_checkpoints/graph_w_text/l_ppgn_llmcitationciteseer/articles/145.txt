In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize agent assignments. Our approach, called 'RL-MASTA', employs a novel combination of graph neural networks and Q-learning to learn task allocation policies that adapt to changing environmental conditions and agent capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-MASTA outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utility.
