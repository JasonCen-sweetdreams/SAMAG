Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, which involves augmenting the original query with relevant terms to improve retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages deep learning-based document embeddings to generate query expansions. Our method, named 'DeepQE', uses a neural network to learn a dense representation of documents and queries, which enables accurate identification of relevant expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as Rocchio and LCA, in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
