Augmented reality (AR) technology has the potential to support older adults with cognitive impairments in their daily lives. However, designing effective AR interfaces for this population requires a deep understanding of their needs and abilities. This paper presents a co-design approach that involves older adults with cognitive impairments as active participants in the design process. We conducted a series of workshops and usability studies to identify key design principles and features that support cognitive accessibility in AR interfaces. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and multimodal feedback in AR design, and demonstrate the feasibility of co-designing AR interfaces with older adults.
