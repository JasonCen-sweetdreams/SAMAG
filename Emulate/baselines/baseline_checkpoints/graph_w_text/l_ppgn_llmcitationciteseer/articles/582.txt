Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query representations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, termed 'GraphEmbed', which leverages neural graph-based document embeddings to enrich query representations. By modeling document relationships as a graph, GraphEmbed captures nuances in document semantics, enabling more effective query expansion. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
