Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale search queries. However, query efficiency remains a significant bottleneck in these systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach that partitions the document collection into multiple layers, each optimized for a specific query type. Our method, called HiIndex, adaptively selects the most suitable index layer based on query characteristics, reducing the number of nodes involved in query processing. Experimental results on a large-scale DIR testbed demonstrate that HiIndex achieves an average query response time reduction of 37% compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
