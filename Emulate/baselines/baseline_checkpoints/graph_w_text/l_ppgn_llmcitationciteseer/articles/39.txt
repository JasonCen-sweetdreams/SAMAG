Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complex and nuanced nature of patent language. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'RL-QE', that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of expansion terms. We model query expansion as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to select terms that maximize the relevance of the retrieved patents. Experimental results on a large patent corpus demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as pseudo-relevance feedback and word embedding-based methods, in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
