Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by a lack of accessibility features for users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces that cater to users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with users from diverse disability groups, resulting in a set of guidelines and recommendations for VR interface designers. Our evaluation study demonstrates that interfaces designed using our framework significantly improve user experience and accessibility for users with disabilities.
