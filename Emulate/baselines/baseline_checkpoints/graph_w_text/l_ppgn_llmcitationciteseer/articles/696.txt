Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, but it remains a challenging task, especially when dealing with large datasets. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'OntoGraph', which leverages graph-based embeddings and ontology alignment to disambiguate entities at scale. Our method first learns entity representations using a graph convolutional neural network, and then aligns these representations with a knowledge graph ontology to resolve ambiguities. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that OntoGraph outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising solution for large-scale knowledge graph construction.
