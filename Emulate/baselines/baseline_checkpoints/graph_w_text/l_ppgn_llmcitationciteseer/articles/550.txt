Virtual reality (VR) systems rely heavily on gesture recognition to provide an immersive user experience. However, the lack of haptic feedback can lead to recognition errors and user frustration. This paper explores the impact of haptic feedback on gesture recognition in VR. We designed a custom VR system with a haptic feedback device and conducted a user study to evaluate the effects of varying feedback intensities on recognition accuracy. Our results show that optimized haptic feedback can improve gesture recognition by up to 23% compared to visual-only feedback, and that user performance is highly dependent on the feedback intensity and gesture type.
