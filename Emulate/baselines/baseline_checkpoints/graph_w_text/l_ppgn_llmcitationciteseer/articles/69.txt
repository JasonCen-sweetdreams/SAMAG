Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in modern data management systems, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and develop a deep Q-network-based algorithm to learn optimal query plans. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and reduces resource utilization by 25%. We also demonstrate the adaptability of our approach to changing database workloads and schemas.
