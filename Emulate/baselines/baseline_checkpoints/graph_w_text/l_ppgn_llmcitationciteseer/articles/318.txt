Query optimization is a critical component in graph database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and scalability. Existing optimization techniques rely on heuristics or static analysis, which may not adapt well to dynamic query workloads. We propose a novel approach, 'GraphRL', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for large-scale graph databases. Our method learns to adapt to changing query patterns and database states, achieving significant improvements in query latency and throughput. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphRL compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
