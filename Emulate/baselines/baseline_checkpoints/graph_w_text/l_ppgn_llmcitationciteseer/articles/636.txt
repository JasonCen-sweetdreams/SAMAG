Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a given question. However, existing dense retrieval methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. We propose a hierarchical dense retrieval approach, 'HDR', which leverages a two-stage retrieval process to efficiently identify relevant passages. Our method first uses a coarse-grained retriever to select top-k candidates, followed by a fine-grained reranker to re-score and re-rank the candidates. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset show that HDR achieves a 2x speedup and 10% improvement in top-20 passage retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods.
