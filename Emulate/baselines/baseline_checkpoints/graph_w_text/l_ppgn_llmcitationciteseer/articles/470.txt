Multi-tenancy in cloud databases introduces significant performance challenges due to concurrent query execution and resource contention. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MQO', which leverages machine learning-based prediction models to dynamically allocate resources and prioritize queries for each tenant. We develop a robust cost model that incorporates query complexity, data freshness, and tenant-specific QoS constraints. Experimental evaluation on a real-world cloud database workload demonstrates that MQO achieves up to 35% improvement in query response times and 20% reduction in resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
