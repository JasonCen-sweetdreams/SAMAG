Virtual Reality (VR) systems often lack realistic haptic feedback, limiting user immersion and interaction. This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive haptic feedback design, which incorporates real-time user behavior analysis and machine learning-based feedback optimization. Our system, 'HapticAdapt', uses a combination of sensor data and user feedback to dynamically adjust the intensity and frequency of haptic stimuli, enhancing user experience and task performance. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional fixed-haptic feedback methods.
