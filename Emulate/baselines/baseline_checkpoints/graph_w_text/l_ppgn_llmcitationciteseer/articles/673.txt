This paper presents a novel gestural interface design framework, 'EasyGest', that caters to older adults with cognitive impairments. EasyGest incorporates a participatory design approach, involving older adults in the design process to identify intuitive and accessible gestures. We conducted a user study with 20 older adults and found that EasyGest outperforms existing gestural interfaces in terms of task completion time and user satisfaction. Our results also highlight the importance of considering cognitive load and motor abilities when designing gestural interfaces for this population.
