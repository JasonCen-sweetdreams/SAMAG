Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attentional neural network (HATN) architecture that detects anomalies in time-series data while providing explainable results. HATN combines local and global attention mechanisms to highlight relevant features and time-steps contributing to anomaly detection. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HATN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and interpretability.
