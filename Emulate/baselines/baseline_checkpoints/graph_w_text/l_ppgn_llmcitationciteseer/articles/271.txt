Specialized search engines, such as those used in e-commerce or biomedical domains, require efficient and effective retrieval mechanisms to handle complex queries. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE+', which leverages a combination of lexical and semantic analysis to disambiguate query terms and expand relevant concepts. We demonstrate the efficacy of HQE+ through experiments on a large-scale e-commerce dataset, showcasing significant improvements in retrieval precision and latency compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
