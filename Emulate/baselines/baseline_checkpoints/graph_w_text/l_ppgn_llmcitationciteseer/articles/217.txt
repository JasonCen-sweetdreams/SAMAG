Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture the semantic relationships between query terms, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages graph-based keyword embeddings to model complex query semantics. Our method, termed 'GraphQEx', represents query terms as nodes in a graph, where edges are weighted by semantic similarity measures derived from a large-scale text corpus. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphQEx significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% relative improvement in mean average precision.
