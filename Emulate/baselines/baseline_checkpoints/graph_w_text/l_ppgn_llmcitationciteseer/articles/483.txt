Visualizing and exploring large graphs is a fundamental task in many domains, including social network analysis, bioinformatics, and recommender systems. However, existing interfaces often rely on manual navigation, leading to cognitive overload and decreased productivity. We present EyeGazeExplorer, a novel gaze-based interface that leverages eye-tracking technology to facilitate efficient and intuitive graph exploration. By combining gaze-based selection, semantic zooming, and dynamic filtering, our system enables users to explore large graphs with reduced cognitive load and improved comprehension. A user study demonstrates the effectiveness of EyeGazeExplorer in reducing navigation time and improving user satisfaction.
