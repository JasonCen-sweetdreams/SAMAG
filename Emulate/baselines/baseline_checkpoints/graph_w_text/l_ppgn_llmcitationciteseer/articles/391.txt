Recommendation systems have become increasingly important in modern e-commerce and social media platforms. However, existing collaborative filtering methods suffer from scalability issues and limited model capacity. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively aggregate user and item features from multiple graphs. Experimental results on large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN achieves significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining interpretable and explainable results.
