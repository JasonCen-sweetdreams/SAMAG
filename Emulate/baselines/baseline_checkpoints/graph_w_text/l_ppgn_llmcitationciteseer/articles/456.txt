This paper presents the design and evaluation of a conversational interface tailored to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a participatory design process involving 15 older adults and 5 caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities in current conversational systems. Our proposed interface, 'EasyChat', incorporates simplified language processing, visual cues, and personalized adaptivity to facilitate more effective and engaging interactions. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
