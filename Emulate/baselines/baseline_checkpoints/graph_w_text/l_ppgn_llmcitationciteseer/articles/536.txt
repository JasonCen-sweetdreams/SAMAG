Virtual reality (VR) technology has seen significant advancements in recent years, but user experience remains a major bottleneck. This paper presents an innovative approach to adaptive UI design, leveraging eye-gaze tracking to dynamically adjust interface elements in real-time. Our system, 'GazeUX', utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify user intent and optimize UI layout, reducing cognitive load and improving task completion time. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that GazeUX outperforms traditional UI designs in VR, resulting in higher user satisfaction and reduced eye fatigue.
