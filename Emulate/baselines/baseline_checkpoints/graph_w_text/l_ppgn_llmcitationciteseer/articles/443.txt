Traditional document retrieval models often neglect the rich contextual information present in queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach, Hierarchical Context Encoder (HCE), which leverages graph neural networks to capture complex relationships between entities, keywords, and semantic concepts. HCE hierarchically represents queries and documents as graphs, and learns to encode contextual information through a novel attention mechanism. Experimental results on the TREC news dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and relevance over state-of-the-art baseline models.
