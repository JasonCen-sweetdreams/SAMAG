Microblogging platforms like Twitter and Weibo have become essential sources of real-time information. However, their short-text nature poses significant challenges for effective information retrieval. This paper proposes a context-aware query expansion framework, 'CAQE', which leverages semantic, syntactic, and pragmatic features to enrich short queries. CAQE incorporates a novel attention-based mechanism to weigh the importance of expanded terms based on their relevance to the original query. Experimental results on a large-scale Twitter dataset demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision.
