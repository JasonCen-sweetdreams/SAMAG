Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatar customization on user experience in VR environments. We designed an experiment with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a customized avatar group or a standard avatar group. Our results show that participants in the customized avatar group exhibited increased engagement, measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported enjoyment. We also found that users with high levels of avatar identification reported higher feelings of presence and immersion. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems, suggesting that personalized avatars can enhance user engagement and overall VR experience.
