Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to efficiently retrieve relevant documents for complex queries. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation, 'HierDoc', which leverages semantic embeddings and graph-based clustering to organize documents into a hierarchical structure. This allows for faster query processing and improved retrieval accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HierDoc on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant reductions in query latency and improvement in mean average precision compared to state-of-the-art retrieval models.
