Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants, have the potential to support older adults in managing their daily lives. However, existing systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This study investigates the design of accessible conversational interfaces for older adults, with a focus on voice-assisted reminders. We conducted a user-centered design process, involving 20 older adults, to develop and evaluate a novel conversational interface. Our results show that the proposed interface significantly improves the usability and accessibility of voice-assisted reminders, particularly for older adults with cognitive and sensory impairments. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of inclusive conversational interfaces.
