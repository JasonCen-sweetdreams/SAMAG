Column-oriented NoSQL databases have gained popularity for storing and querying large-scale data. However, supporting efficient range queries remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'CRex', which leverages the column-oriented storage layout to accelerate range queries. CRex employs a combination of bitmapped indexing and column-grouping to reduce the query search space. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that CRex outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 3x in query execution time, while maintaining a low storage overhead.
