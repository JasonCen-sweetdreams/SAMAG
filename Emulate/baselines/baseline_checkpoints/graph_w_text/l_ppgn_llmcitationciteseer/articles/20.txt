Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their usefulness is often limited for users with disabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the conversational strategies employed by popular voice assistants and their impact on accessibility. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with disabilities and found that current systems often rely on visual cues, assume uniform linguistic abilities, and neglect context-dependent preferences. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants, emphasizing the need for adaptive dialogue management, multimodal input support, and user-centered customization. Our findings have significant implications for the development of more accessible and usable conversational systems.
