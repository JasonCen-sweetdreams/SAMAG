Short-text retrieval remains a challenging task due to the limited contextual information available. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages word embeddings and concept graphs to capture nuanced semantic relationships. Our method embeds query terms and documents in a shared vector space, then uses graph-based clustering to identify relevant concepts. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short queries, over state-of-the-art baselines.
