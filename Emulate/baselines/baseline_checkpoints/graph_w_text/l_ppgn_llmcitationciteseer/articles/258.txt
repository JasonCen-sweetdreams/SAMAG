We present a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our Hierarchical Task Allocation (HTA) framework utilizes a two-level hierarchy of agents, where high-level agents allocate tasks to low-level agents based on their capabilities and available resources. We employ a decentralized deep Q-network (DDQN) to learn the optimal task allocation policy, which is shown to outperform traditional methods in terms of task completion efficiency and agent utility. Experimental results demonstrate the scalability and adaptability of HTA in various simulated scenarios.
