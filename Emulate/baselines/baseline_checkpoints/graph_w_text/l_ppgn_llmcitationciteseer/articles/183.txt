The increasing demand for real-time analytics has led to a growing importance of efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'Grapheon', which exploits the structural properties of query graphs to optimize query plans for real-time analytics workloads. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that leverages graph convolutional networks to predict query execution times and identifies the most efficient query plans. Experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that Grapheon outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and throughput.
