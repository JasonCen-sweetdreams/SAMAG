Autonomous agents are increasingly being used in various applications, such as robotics, drones, and smart homes. One of the key challenges in multi-agent systems is task allocation, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a distributed task allocation framework using reinforcement learning, which enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and real-world experiments, showing significant improvements in task completion time and agent utilization.
