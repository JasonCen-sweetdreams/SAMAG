Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a user's question. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document embedding (HDE) approach that captures both local and global document structures to improve passage retrieval efficiency. Our HDE model consists of a document-level transformer encoder and a passage-level dense retriever, which are jointly trained to optimize a combination of retrieval and answer generation objectives. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art dense retrieval models while reducing computational costs by up to 40%
