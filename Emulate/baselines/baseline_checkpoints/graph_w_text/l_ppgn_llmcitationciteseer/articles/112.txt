With the increasing complexity of modern information networks, traditional ranking models struggle to effectively retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a hybrid ranking model, 'HetRank', which integrates graph-based and learning-to-rank approaches to leverage the strengths of both. HetRank incorporates network embedding and graph attention mechanisms to capture structural relationships between documents and entities. Experimental results on a large-scale heterogeneous information network demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for cold-start and sparse data scenarios.
