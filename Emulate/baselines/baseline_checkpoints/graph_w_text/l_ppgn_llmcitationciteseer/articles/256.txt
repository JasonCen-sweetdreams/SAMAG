Learning node representations is a fundamental task in graph-structured data analysis. However, existing methods often suffer from scalability issues or fail to capture complex relationships between nodes. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture that leverages a hierarchical clustering strategy to learn efficient node representations. By recursively applying graph pooling and node aggregation, HGNN effectively reduces the dimensionality of node features while preserving essential structural information. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of node classification accuracy and computational efficiency.
