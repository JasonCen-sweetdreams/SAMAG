Real-time analytics in distributed database systems require efficient query optimization to meet stringent latency and throughput requirements. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DynaOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and dynamic re-optimization to adapt to changing workload conditions. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines traditional rule-based optimization with neural network-based cost modeling, achieving an average improvement of 35% in query response time compared to state-of-the-art optimizers. Experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaOpt in handling complex analytical queries.
