As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need to develop intuitive and efficient interaction methods. This paper explores the use of gaze-based interaction in AR environments, focusing on user experience and performance. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, comparing gaze-based selection with traditional controller-based input. Our results show that gaze-based interaction significantly reduces task completion time and improves user satisfaction, particularly in tasks requiring precise object manipulation. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of AR interfaces and propose future research directions.
