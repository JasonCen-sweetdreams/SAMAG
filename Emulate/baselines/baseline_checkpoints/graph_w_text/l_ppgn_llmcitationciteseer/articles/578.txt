Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep semantic word embeddings to capture the nuanced relationships between words. Our method uses a convolutional neural network to learn a dense representation of words and their contexts, which are then used to generate expanded queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and reciprocal rank.
