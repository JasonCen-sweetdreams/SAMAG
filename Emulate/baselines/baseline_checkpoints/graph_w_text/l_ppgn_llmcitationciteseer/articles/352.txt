This paper explores the application of decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning to autonomous traffic signal control. We propose a novel framework, 'MA-STRL', which enables multiple agents to learn and adapt to dynamic traffic patterns in real-time. Each agent, representing a traffic signal, learns to optimize its control policy based on local observations and communicate with neighboring agents to achieve global coordination. We evaluate MA-STRL on a realistic traffic simulation platform and demonstrate significant improvements in traffic flow and reduction in congestion compared to traditional signal control methods.
