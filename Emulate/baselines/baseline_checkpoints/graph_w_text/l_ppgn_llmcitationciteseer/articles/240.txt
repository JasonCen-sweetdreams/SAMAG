Query expansion is a crucial component in modern information retrieval systems, as it helps to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem between the user's query and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using adaptive contextualized embeddings, which dynamically captures the semantic relationships between query terms and their surrounding context. Our method, dubbed ACE-QE, leverages pre-trained language models to generate contextualized embeddings for query terms and then adaptively selects the most informative expansion terms based on their relevance to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACE-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
