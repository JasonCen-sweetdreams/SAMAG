Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but traditional input devices limit the immersive experience. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interaction framework, 'Embodio', which leverages embodied cognition principles to enhance user experience in VR. By incorporating machine learning-driven gesture recognition and adaptive feedback, Embodio enables users to naturally interact with virtual objects using body gestures, leading to improved engagement, retention, and overall usability. A user study demonstrates significant benefits of Embodio over conventional input methods, highlighting its potential for VR-based applications in education, entertainment, and beyond.
