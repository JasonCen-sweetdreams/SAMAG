As robots increasingly interact with humans in various settings, effective communication becomes crucial. This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in human-robot collaboration, focusing on gestural communication. We designed an experiment where humans and robots collaborated on a task, using either explicit language-based instructions or implicit gestural cues. Our results show that gestural communication enhances task performance, reduces errors, and increases user satisfaction. We also found that humans adapt their gestural patterns to the robot's capabilities, demonstrating a deepening of mutual understanding. Our findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and effective human-robot collaboration systems.
