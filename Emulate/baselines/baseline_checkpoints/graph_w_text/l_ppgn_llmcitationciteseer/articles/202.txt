Distributed relational databases with heterogeneous storage face significant query optimization challenges. This paper presents a novel cost-based optimization framework, 'HetroOpt', which leverages statistical models to estimate query execution times on diverse storage media. HetroOpt incorporates a new storage-aware join ordering algorithm and a dynamic data placement strategy to minimize data transfer and optimize query performance. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate that HetroOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
