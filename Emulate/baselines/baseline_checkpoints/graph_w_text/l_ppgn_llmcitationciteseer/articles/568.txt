State-of-the-art neural retrieval models for document ranking rely on complex query-document interaction mechanisms, leading to increased computational costs. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HiQE', which leverages hierarchical query embeddings to efficiently capture nuanced query semantics. By recursively aggregating query term representations, HiQE generates a compact, hierarchical query embedding that can be effectively matched with document representations. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that HiQE achieves comparable ranking performance to state-of-the-art models while reducing computational overhead by up to 40%.
