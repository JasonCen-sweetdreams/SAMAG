Virtual assistants have the potential to improve the daily lives of people with disabilities, but current systems often fail to meet their unique needs. This paper presents a participatory design approach to developing intelligent virtual assistants that are accessible and usable by people with disabilities. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with individuals with disabilities, caregivers, and accessibility experts to identify key requirements and design principles. Our proposed framework, 'AccessibleVA', incorporates multimodal input, adaptive interfaces, and personalized assistance to support users with diverse abilities. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing virtual assistants.
