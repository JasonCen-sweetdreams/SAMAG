Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DistOpt', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective query plans for DDS. DistOpt models the query optimization problem as a graph-based optimization problem and uses GNNs to learn the relationships between queries, data distributions, and system resources. Experimental results on the TPC-H benchmark show that DistOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
