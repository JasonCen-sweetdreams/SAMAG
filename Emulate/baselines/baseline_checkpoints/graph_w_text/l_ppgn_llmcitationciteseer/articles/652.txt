Query expansion is a crucial step in improving the effectiveness of information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. We introduce a model that learns to generate expanded queries by modeling the semantic relationships between the original query terms and the relevant documents. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of retrieval accuracy. We also show that the learned expanded queries can be effectively used to improve the performance of various retrieval models.
