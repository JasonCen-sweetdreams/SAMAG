Ad-hoc retrieval, a fundamental task in information retrieval, involves retrieving relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion (QE) is a popular technique to improve retrieval performance. However, existing QE methods rely on manual feature engineering and often struggle to capture complex query-document relationships. This paper proposes a novel approach, DeepQE, which leverages deep neural networks to learn query-document interactions and generate effective expansion terms. We evaluate DeepQE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional QE methods.
