Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information, but limited research has focused on the role of haptic feedback in shaping user experience. This study investigates the effect of personalized haptic feedback on user engagement, satisfaction, and performance in VR environments. We propose a novel framework for adaptively tailoring haptic feedback to individual users' preferences, and evaluate its impact through a user study involving 30 participants. Results show that personalized haptic feedback significantly enhances user experience, particularly for users with prior VR exposure. Our findings have implications for designing more immersive and inclusive VR systems.
