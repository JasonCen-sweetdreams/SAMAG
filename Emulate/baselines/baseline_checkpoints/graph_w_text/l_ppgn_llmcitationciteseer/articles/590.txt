Time-series anomaly detection is a critical task in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Neural Network (HANN) that detects anomalies while providing explanations. HANN uses a hierarchical structure to capture multi-scale patterns and an attention mechanism to highlight relevant features. We evaluate HANN on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and explainability. Additionally, we introduce a novel visualization technique to illustrate the attention weights, enabling users to understand the decision-making process.
