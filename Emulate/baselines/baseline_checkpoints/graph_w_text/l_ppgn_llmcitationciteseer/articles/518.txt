Real-time analytics on column-store databases is crucial for various applications, including IoT and financial data processing. However, existing query optimization techniques are often inadequate for column-store databases, leading to poor query performance. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages column-level statistics and machine learning-based predicate estimation to optimize query plans. We introduce a cost-based optimization approach that considers both CPU and memory access patterns, resulting in improved query execution times and reduced memory usage. Experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of ColOpt in achieving up to 3x query performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
