Distributed search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from a vast, geographically dispersed index. This paper presents a novel context-aware query expansion technique that leverages user behavior, query logs, and semantic analysis to improve retrieval efficiency. Our approach, called CAQE, adaptively selects expansion terms based on the user's search history and context, reducing the number of unnecessary query iterations and resulting in significant latency reductions. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed search engine demonstrate CAQE's effectiveness in improving retrieval efficiency while maintaining relevance and precision.
