Efficient task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and constraints need to cooperate to achieve complex goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize agent assignments. Our approach, called 'DRL-TA', uses a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn agent policies that adapt to dynamic task requirements and environmental changes. Experimental results on a simulated robotics domain demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
