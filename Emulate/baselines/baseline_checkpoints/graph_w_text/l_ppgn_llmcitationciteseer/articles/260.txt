Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in retrieving relevant documents in information retrieval (IR) systems. However, existing QE methods often suffer from high computational overhead, leading to slow response times. This paper proposes a novel real-time QE framework, 'RTEQE', which leverages a combination of lexical semantic analysis and machine learning-based term weighting. RTEQE reduces the dimensionality of the query space by identifying key contextual phrases, and then applies an efficient term re-weighting scheme to prioritize informative terms. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RTEQE achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness while reducing query processing time by up to 50% compared to state-of-the-art QE methods.
