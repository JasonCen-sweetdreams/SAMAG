Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for graph-structured data analysis. However, their performance is highly dependent on the choice of hyperparameters, which can be computationally expensive to tune. This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization framework, 'GraphBO', that leverages the graph structure to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters. We demonstrate that GraphBO outperforms traditional Bayesian optimization methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including molecular property prediction and social network analysis.
