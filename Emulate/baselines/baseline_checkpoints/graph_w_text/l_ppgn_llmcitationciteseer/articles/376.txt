Distributed database systems with heterogeneous storage configurations are increasingly common, but optimizing query performance in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'HeteroOpt', which leverages statistical models and reinforcement learning to adapt to varying storage characteristics. HeteroOpt integrates a cost-based optimizer with a storage-aware query planner, enabling efficient query execution across a range of storage configurations. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
