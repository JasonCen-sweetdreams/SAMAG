Result diversification is a critical challenge in modern search engines, as it directly impacts user satisfaction and engagement. This paper presents a novel approach to query facet generation, which leverages the representational power of deep neural networks to better capture the underlying intent behind user queries. Our proposed model, FacetNet, incorporates a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes facet generation and ranking, leading to improved result diversification and reduced redundancy. Experiments on a large-scale query log dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of FacetNet in enhancing search engine performance, with significant gains in metrics such as novelty and diversity.
