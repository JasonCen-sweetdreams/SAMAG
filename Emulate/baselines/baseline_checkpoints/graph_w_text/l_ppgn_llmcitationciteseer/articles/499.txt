With the growing adoption of RDF as a standard for data representation, querying large RDF graphs has become a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ParaHeur', that leverages parallel processing and machine learning-based heuristics to reduce query execution times. We introduce a cost-based optimization strategy that adaptively selects the most effective join order and indexing scheme for a given query. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that ParaHeur achieves speedups of up to 5x compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers, while maintaining high accuracy and robustness.
