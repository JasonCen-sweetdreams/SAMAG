This paper investigates the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to alleviate cognitive load in older adults during human-computer interactions. We designed an ECA-based interface that incorporates gestures, facial expressions, and speech to facilitate multimodal communication. In a user study with 30 older adults, we compared the ECA-based interface with a traditional graphical user interface (GUI) in a task-oriented scenario. Results show that participants using the ECA-based interface exhibited significantly reduced cognitive load, as measured by pupil dilation and self-reported workload, while maintaining comparable task performance. Our findings suggest that ECAs can be a valuable design approach for promoting accessible and inclusive HCI for older adults.
