 Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the quality of life for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing systems often rely on standardized gesture sets and machine learning models that are not adaptable to individual differences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing adaptive gesture recognition systems that can learn from user interactions and adapt to changing abilities. We propose a crowdsourced approach to collecting gesture data from individuals with motor impairments and develop a personalized machine learning model that can recognize gestures with high accuracy. Our evaluation with 20 participants shows that our system outperforms traditional gesture recognition systems by 25% in terms of recognition accuracy.
