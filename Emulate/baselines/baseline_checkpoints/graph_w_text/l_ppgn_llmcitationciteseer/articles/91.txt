Distributed column-store databases have become increasingly popular for big data analytics. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of distributed processing and column-oriented storage. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost modeling and dynamic reordering of join operations. We demonstrate that ColOpt achieves up to 3x improvement in query execution time compared to state-of-the-art optimizers on a real-world dataset. Furthermore, our approach is scalable and adaptable to varying workload patterns, making it suitable for modern data warehousing applications.
