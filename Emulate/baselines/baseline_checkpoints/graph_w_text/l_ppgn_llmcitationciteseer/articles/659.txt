Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable user-item interactions. This paper introduces HeteroGAT, a novel heterogeneous graph attention network that incorporates item, user, and contextual features to generate personalized explanations for recommendations. We propose a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes recommendation accuracy and explanation quality. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HeteroGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy, explanation coherence, and user satisfaction.
