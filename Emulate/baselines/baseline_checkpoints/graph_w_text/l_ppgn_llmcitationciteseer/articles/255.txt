Query expansion is a crucial component of document retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the precision and recall of search results. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepSQE', which leverages semantic embeddings to expand queries with relevant terms. Our method incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on the most informative terms in the query and document contexts. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepSQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and reduced query latency.
