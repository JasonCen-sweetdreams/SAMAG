In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework based on distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) techniques. Our approach, called DACOTA, enables agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner, without relying on a centralized authority. We propose a novel DCOP algorithm that incorporates a heuristic search strategy to improve the quality of the allocation. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DACOTA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and communication overhead.
