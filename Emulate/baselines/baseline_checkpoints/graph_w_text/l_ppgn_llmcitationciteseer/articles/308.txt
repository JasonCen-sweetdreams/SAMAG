Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to accurately capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'EmbedExpan', which leverages neural embeddings to model semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. By incorporating a self-attention mechanism, EmbedExpan adaptively weights the importance of expansion terms based on their contextual relevance, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant gains in mean average precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art expansion techniques.
