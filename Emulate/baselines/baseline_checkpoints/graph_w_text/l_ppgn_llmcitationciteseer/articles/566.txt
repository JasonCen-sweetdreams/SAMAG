Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it aims to capture the underlying intent behind a user's query. Traditional methods rely on keyword extraction and synonym-based expansion, which may not fully capture the context and semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Our model, 'GCN-Expand', leverages a knowledge graph to represent term relationships and learns to selectively expand queries based on contextual features. Experimental results on the TREC datasets show that GCN-Expand outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and robustness to query ambiguity.
