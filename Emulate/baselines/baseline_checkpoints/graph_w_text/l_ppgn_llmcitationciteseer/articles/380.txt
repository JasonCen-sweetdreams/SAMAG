Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention graph convolutional network (HAGCN) architecture that leverages both user-item interactions and side information to generate personalized explanations. Our approach learns to attend to relevant nodes in the graph, capturing complex relationships between users and items. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that HAGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
