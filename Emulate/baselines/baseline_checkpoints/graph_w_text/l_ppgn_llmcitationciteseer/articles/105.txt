Real-time database systems (RTDBS) require predictable and efficient concurrency control to meet timing constraints. This paper presents a novel concurrency control protocol, 'Predictive-OCC', which leverages machine learning-based workload prediction to dynamically adjust lock timeouts and minimize aborts. We introduce a hierarchical locking mechanism that adapts to changing workload patterns, reducing lock contention and improving system throughput. Experimental results on a simulated RTDBS workload demonstrate that Predictive-OCC outperforms existing protocols in terms of response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
