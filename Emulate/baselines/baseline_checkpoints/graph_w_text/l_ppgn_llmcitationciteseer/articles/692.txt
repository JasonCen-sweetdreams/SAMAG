As data sizes continue to grow, efficient indexing techniques are crucial for supporting fast query performance. This paper presents 'RiFT', a novel indexing method optimized for multi-dimensional range queries on modern storage systems. RiFT leverages the parallelization capabilities of modern SSDs and HDDs to accelerate query processing. We propose a hierarchical indexing structure that adaptively partitions the data space, reducing the number of disk accesses and improving query latency. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that RiFT outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving up to 3x speedup for complex range queries.
