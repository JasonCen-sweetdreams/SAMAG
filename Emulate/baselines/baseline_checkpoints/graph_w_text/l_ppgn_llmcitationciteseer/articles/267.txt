The increasing adoption of cloud-based data warehouses has led to a surge in the storage and analysis of large multidimensional arrays. Query optimization for such arrays is crucial to ensure efficient processing and reduced latency. This paper presents a novel cost-based query optimization framework, 'ArrayOpt', that leverages statistical models and machine learning techniques to predict query execution costs. We introduce a novel array representation scheme that enables efficient pruning of irrelevant data and reduces the search space for query optimization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ArrayOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in query execution time.
