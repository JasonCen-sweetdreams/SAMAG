Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on accurate object detection systems to navigate complex environments. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for real-time object detection in autonomous vehicles. Our approach leverages a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism and a hierarchical attention module to selectively focus on relevant regions of interest. We evaluate our HAN model on the KITTI dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy and speed compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our proposed approach has the potential to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments.
