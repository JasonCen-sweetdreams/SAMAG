Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging problem in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'NeuroQE', uses a graph-based neural network to learn dense representations of documents and expand the original query with relevant terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
