Multi-label node classification is a fundamental problem in graph-based machine learning, where each node can belong to multiple classes. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that effectively captures complex node relationships and label correlations. Our approach employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify relevant neighbors and labels at multiple scales, allowing the model to adapt to diverse graph structures and label distributions. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of macro-F1 score and label ranking metrics.
