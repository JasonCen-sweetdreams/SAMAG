The increasing number of IoT devices has led to a surge in anomalous traffic, posing significant security threats. This paper proposes a novel real-time anomaly detection framework, 'IoT-Guard', which leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to identify and respond to anomalies in IoT networks. IoT-Guard uses a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) to learn a policy that maps network traffic patterns to anomaly scores, and a custom-designed reward function to optimize detection accuracy. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that IoT-Guard outperforms traditional machine learning approaches in terms of detection accuracy and speed, while adapting to concept drift and varying network conditions.
