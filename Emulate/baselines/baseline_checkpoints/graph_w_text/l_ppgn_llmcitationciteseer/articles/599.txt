In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects the overall performance and efficiency of the system. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task allocation framework that utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach employs a two-level hierarchy, where high-level agents allocate tasks to low-level agents based on their capabilities and availability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations on a disaster response scenario, showing significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing methods.
