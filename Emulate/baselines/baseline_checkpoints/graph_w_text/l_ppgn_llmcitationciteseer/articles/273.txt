Skyline queries are essential in multi-criteria decision-making applications, but their computation can be computationally expensive and challenging to scale in distributed database systems. This paper presents Efficientsky, a novel algorithm that leverages data partitioning and parallel processing to accelerate skyline query evaluation. We introduce a dynamic pruning technique that reduces the number of candidate points and a load-balancing strategy to minimize communication overhead. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that Efficientsky outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by up to 5x in terms of query response time and scales to large datasets with millions of records.
