This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach enables agents to selectively focus on relevant teammates and environmental features, leading to improved cooperation and decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a variety of multi-agent environments, including traffic management and robotic soccer. Furthermore, we provide visualizations and quantitative metrics to illustrate the interpretable nature of our model, facilitating human understanding of complex agent behaviors.
