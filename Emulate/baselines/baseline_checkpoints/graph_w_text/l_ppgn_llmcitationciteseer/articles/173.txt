Information retrieval (IR) systems rely on effective document representation to retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) for document representation, which captures both local and global contextual information. Our approach represents documents as graphs, utilizing node attention to selectively focus on relevant keywords and sentence-level attention to model contextual relationships. Experimental results on the TREC-COVID dataset demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including BERT-based models, in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
