Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but existing VR systems often neglect the needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences, focusing on users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key accessibility barriers and developed a set of design guidelines and recommendations for VR developers. Our evaluation shows that incorporating these guidelines can significantly improve the overall VR experience for users with disabilities, enhancing their sense of presence, engagement, and satisfaction.
