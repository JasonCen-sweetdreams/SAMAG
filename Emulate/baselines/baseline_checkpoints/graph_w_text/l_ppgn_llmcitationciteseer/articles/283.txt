The rise of Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms has led to a surge in multi-tenancy, where multiple clients share the same database instance. However, this sharing can result in performance degradation and increased latency due to resource contention. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MTQO', designed specifically for multi-tenant DBaaS platforms. MTQO leverages machine learning-based prediction models to identify performance-critical queries and dynamically adjusts resource allocation to minimize latency and improve overall system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform show that MTQO achieves an average query latency reduction of 35% compared to traditional optimization techniques.
