Negotiation is a crucial aspect of multi-agent systems, where agents must reach agreements to achieve common goals. However, existing approaches often rely on oversimplifying assumptions, neglecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel autonomous negotiation strategy, 'RealNegotiator', which integrates machine learning and game theory to adapt to dynamic environments. Our approach learns from historical data and incorporates domain knowledge to improve negotiation outcomes. We evaluate RealNegotiator in a realistic supply chain management scenario, demonstrating improved negotiation efficiency and profit compared to state-of-the-art methods.
