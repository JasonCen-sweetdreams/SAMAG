Edge computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing latency and improving performance in IoT and real-time applications. However, resource allocation in edge environments remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a decentralized agent-based framework, 'EdgeAgent', which leverages autonomous agents to allocate resources dynamically based on real-time demand and availability. We introduce a novel multi-agent negotiation protocol that enables agents to coordinate and optimize resource allocation, resulting in improved system utilization and reduced latency. Experimental results on a simulated edge computing platform demonstrate the effectiveness of EdgeAgent in adapting to changing workload conditions.
