Autonomous vehicles require real-time decision-making capabilities to navigate complex scenarios. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'StratAvail', that enables strategic decision-making in autonomous vehicles. We integrate a graph neural network with a multi-agent Q-learning approach to model dynamic interactions between vehicles and the environment. Experimental results demonstrate that StratAvail outperforms existing methods in real-world scenarios, achieving improved safety, efficiency, and adaptability. Our approach has significant implications for the deployment of autonomous vehicles in real-world settings.
