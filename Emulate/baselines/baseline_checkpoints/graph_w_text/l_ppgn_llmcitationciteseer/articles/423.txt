Task-oriented conversational agents have become ubiquitous in various applications, including customer service and virtual assistants. However, their dialogue management systems often struggle to effectively incorporate contextual information and adapt to evolving user goals. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention-based dialogue management framework that leverages both utterance-level and conversation-level representations to generate more coherent and goal-oriented responses. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in dialogue success rate and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in complex, multi-turn conversations.
