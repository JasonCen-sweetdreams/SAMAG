Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in many homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to creating inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted co-design workshops with 20 older adults to identify key accessibility requirements, such as simplified syntax, explicit error handling, and personalized feedback. We then developed a prototype voice assistant incorporating these features and evaluated its usability with 15 older adults. Results show significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates compared to existing voice assistants. Our findings inform the design of more accessible and usable voice assistants for older adults.
