Older adults with cognitive impairments face significant barriers when interacting with voice-based interfaces, leading to feelings of frustration and isolation. This paper presents the results of a co-design study with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments, exploring their needs and preferences for voice-based interfaces. We identify key design considerations, including the use of simple, consistent language, visual feedback, and adaptive difficulty levels. We also develop and evaluate a prototype interface, 'EasyVoice', which incorporates these design principles and achieves significant improvements in user engagement and task completion rates compared to existing voice assistants.
