Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information. However, the cognitive implications of gesture-based interaction in VR remain poorly understood. This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in VR, where users' bodily experiences influence their cognitive processes. We conducted a user study to examine how gesture-based interaction affects spatial reasoning, memory recall, and problem-solving skills. Our results show that VR environments that incorporate embodied cognition principles can enhance user performance and engagement. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR interfaces and their potential applications in education and training.
