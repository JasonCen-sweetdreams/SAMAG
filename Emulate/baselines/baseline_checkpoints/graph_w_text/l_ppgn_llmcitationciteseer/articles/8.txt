As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent in educational settings, there is a growing need for intuitive and adaptive interfaces that facilitate effective learning experiences. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interface design framework for AR learning environments, which leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to dynamically recognize and adapt to users' gestures. Our approach incorporates real-time user feedback and cognitive load assessment to optimize the interface's responsiveness and minimize user frustration. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates significant improvements in learning outcomes and user satisfaction compared to traditional keyboard-based interfaces.
