Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their one-size-fits-all design often falls short for users with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants that cater to individual needs. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with disabilities, exploring their experiences and preferences for personalized voice assistant interactions. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive speech recognition, customizable feedback modalities, and accessible tutorials. We propose a novel framework for inclusive voice assistant design, incorporating user profiling, adaptive feedback, and multimodal interaction. The implications of our work have significant potential for promoting digital accessibility and independence for users with disabilities.
