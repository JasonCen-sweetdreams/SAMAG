Node classification in large-scale graphs is a fundamental problem in graph-structured data analysis. Existing graph neural network (GNN) models suffer from scalability issues and fail to capture hierarchical graph structures. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture, which combines multi-scale graph attention mechanisms to capture complex node relationships. HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including the massive OGB-LSCII graph, and demonstrates significant improvements over existing GNN models in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
