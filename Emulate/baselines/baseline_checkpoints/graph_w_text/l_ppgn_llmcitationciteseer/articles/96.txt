Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks, but their robustness against adversarial attacks remains an open challenge. This paper proposes a novel stealthy node injection attack, 'GhostNode', which can manipulate the graph structure to mislead GNNs. We demonstrate that GhostNode can achieve high attack success rates on popular graph datasets, even when the GNN is trained with existing defense mechanisms. We also provide theoretical analysis on the attack's effectiveness and propose potential countermeasures to improve GNN robustness.
