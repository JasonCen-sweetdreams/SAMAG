Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but interactions within VR environments remain limited. This paper explores the potential of gaze-based interaction (GBI) in VR, where users control objects with their gaze. We conduct a user study to evaluate the usability and performance of GBI in a VR-based puzzle game. Our results show that GBI significantly improves user experience, especially for novice users, and achieves comparable task completion times to traditional controller-based input. We discuss the implications of our findings for future VR interaction design and provide recommendations for optimizing GBI in VR applications.
