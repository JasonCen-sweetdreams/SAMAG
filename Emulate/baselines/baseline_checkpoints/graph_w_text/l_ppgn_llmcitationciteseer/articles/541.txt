Distributed database systems pose significant challenges in query optimization, where suboptimal plans can lead to substantial performance degradation. This paper introduces 'DeepOpt', a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed environments. We design a reward function that incorporates both query execution time and resource utilization, enabling the agent to learn efficient query plans that balance these competing objectives. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate that DeepOpt outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while reducing resource utilization by up to 25%.
