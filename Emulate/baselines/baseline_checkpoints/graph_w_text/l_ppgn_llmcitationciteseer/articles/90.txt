Medical information retrieval (MIR) faces unique challenges due to the complexity of medical terminology and the need for high precision. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'MedExp', that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to improve retrieval effectiveness. MedExp combines a neural ranking model with a relevance feedback mechanism that adaptively selects expansion terms from a medical thesaurus. Experiments on the TREC Medical Retrieval benchmark demonstrate that MedExp outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
