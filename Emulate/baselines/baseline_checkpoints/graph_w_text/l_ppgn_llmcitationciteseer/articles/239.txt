Long-tail classification problems, where a few classes dominate the majority, are prevalent in many real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that adaptively focuses on relevant features and classes to improve classification accuracy and efficiency. Our HAN model consists of a class-aware attention module that selects informative features and a hierarchical classification module that leverages the attention weights to predict probabilities. Experiments on several long-tail datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.
