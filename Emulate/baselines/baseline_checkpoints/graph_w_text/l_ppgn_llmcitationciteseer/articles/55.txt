Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but current interfaces often exacerbate existing accessibility barriers. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive VR interfaces for this population. We conducted participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify interface requirements and developed a novel VR system, 'EasyVR', that incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified navigation and error prevention. Our evaluation with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments showed significant improvements in usability and user experience compared to commercial VR systems.
