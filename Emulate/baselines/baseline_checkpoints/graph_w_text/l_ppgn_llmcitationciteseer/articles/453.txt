Trust management is a crucial aspect of multi-agent systems, as it enables agents to make informed decisions about cooperation and communication. This paper proposes a novel adaptive trust management framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize trust dynamics in dynamic environments. Our approach, dubbed 'ATMA', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal trust update strategy based on agent interactions and environmental feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ATMA in a simulated disaster response scenario, where it outperforms traditional trust management methods in terms of cooperation efficiency and system resilience.
