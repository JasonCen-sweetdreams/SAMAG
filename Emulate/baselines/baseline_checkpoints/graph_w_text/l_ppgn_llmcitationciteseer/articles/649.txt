In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning approach for autonomous task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We propose a hierarchical framework that integrates a high-level task allocator with low-level agent controllers. The task allocator learns to assign tasks to agents based on their capabilities, workload, and communication constraints, while the agent controllers learn to execute tasks efficiently. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional planning-based methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
