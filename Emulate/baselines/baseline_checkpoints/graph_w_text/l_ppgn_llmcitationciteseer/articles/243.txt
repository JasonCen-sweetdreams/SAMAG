This paper proposes a novel hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for autonomous vehicle control. Our approach, dubbed 'HMAVC', leverages a decentralized architecture where each vehicle is modeled as an agent that learns to interact with its surroundings and other agents. We introduce a hierarchical policy structure that enables agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and learn high-level decision-making strategies. Experimental results in a simulated urban driving environment demonstrate that HMAVC outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods in terms of safety, efficiency, and scalability.
