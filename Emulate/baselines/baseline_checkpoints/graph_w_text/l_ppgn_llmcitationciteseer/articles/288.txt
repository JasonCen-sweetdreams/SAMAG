In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to coordinate task allocation among agents. Our method, called GraphCAT, represents the agent-task graph as a neural network and learns to optimize task assignments based on agent capabilities, task priorities, and graph structure. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that GraphCAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and overall system efficiency.
