Collaborative virtual reality (VR) experiences often lack effective communication and spatial awareness among users. This paper presents a proxemic-aware interface design framework that incorporates subtle, non-verbal cues to enhance collaboration and social presence in VR. Our approach leverages machine learning-based gesture recognition, gaze tracking, and spatial audio cues to create an immersive and engaging experience. We evaluate our design through a user study, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction, communication efficiency, and overall collaboration quality.
