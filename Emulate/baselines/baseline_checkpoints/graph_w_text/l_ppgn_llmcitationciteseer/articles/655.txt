In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach to dynamic task allocation using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). Our method, called Hierarchical Task Allocator (HTA), consists of a high-level planner that assigns tasks to agents and a low-level learner that adapts to changing environmental conditions. We evaluate HTA in a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced response times compared to traditional auction-based methods. Our approach enables scalable and flexible task allocation in complex, dynamic environments.
