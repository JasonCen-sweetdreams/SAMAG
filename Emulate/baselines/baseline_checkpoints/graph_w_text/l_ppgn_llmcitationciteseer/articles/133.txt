The increasing adoption of column-store databases for real-time analytics has led to a pressing need for efficient indexing techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing scheme, 'ColIndex', that leverages the columnar storage layout to accelerate query processing. ColIndex utilizes a combination of Bloom filters and adaptive sampling to reduce the number of disk accesses, resulting in significant performance gains. Our evaluation on a distributed column-store demonstrates that ColIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x for aggregation queries and 2x for filtering queries.
