Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in enhancing learning outcomes, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR-based learning environments. We designed an experiment involving 120 participants, who interacted with a VR-based educational platform using either a generic or personalized avatar. Results indicate that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, motivation, and self-efficacy, particularly among learners with lower prior experience with VR. We discuss implications for VR-based learning and provide recommendations for designing effective personalized avatars.
