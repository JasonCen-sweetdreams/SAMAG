Decentralized task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents need to allocate tasks efficiently without a central controller. This paper proposes a novel approach using multi-agent reinforcement learning, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. We introduce a decentralized, asynchronous Q-learning algorithm that enables agents to adapt to changing environments and task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional, centralized approaches.
