With the increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles, efficient task allocation becomes critical for large-scale deployment. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, dubbed 'AVTAR', to allocate tasks among autonomous vehicles in real-time. AVTAR leverages a graph neural network to model vehicle interactions and a hierarchical deep Q-network to learn optimal task assignments. Our experiments on a simulated urban environment demonstrate that AVTAR outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion rate, latency, and adaptability to changing traffic conditions.
