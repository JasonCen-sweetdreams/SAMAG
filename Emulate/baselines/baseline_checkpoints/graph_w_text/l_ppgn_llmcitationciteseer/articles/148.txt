E-commerce search engines face the challenge of accurately retrieving relevant products from large catalogs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-ECOM', which leverages the hierarchical structure of product categories to improve retrieval efficiency. HQE-ECOM adaptively selects expansion terms based on the query context and product correlations, reducing the search space and improving precision. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate a 25% increase in retrieval efficiency and a 15% improvement in precision compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
