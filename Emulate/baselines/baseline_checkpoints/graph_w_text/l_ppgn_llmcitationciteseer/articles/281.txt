Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but the impact of embodiment on user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining the effects of embodiment on user engagement, presence, and cognitive load in VR environments. We designed three VR scenarios with varying levels of embodiment, from low (controllers-only) to high (full-body tracking), and collected both quantitative (physiological, behavioral) and qualitative (interviews, surveys) data from 30 participants. Our results show that increasing embodiment leads to higher user engagement, sense of presence, and reduced cognitive load, but also highlights the importance of considering individual differences in embodiment preferences.
