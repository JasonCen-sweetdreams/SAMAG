As robots increasingly enter industrial workplaces, understanding human-robot collaboration (HRC) is crucial for efficient and safe task execution. This paper explores the role of embodiment in HRC, examining how robots' physical presence and gestural cues influence human trust, workload, and task performance. We conduct a user study with 30 participants, comparing a robot with a humanoid upper body to a screen-based interface. Our results show that the embodied robot enhances user experience and performance, particularly in tasks requiring precise object manipulation. We discuss implications for designing effective HRC systems and provide recommendations for future research.
