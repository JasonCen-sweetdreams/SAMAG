Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly being deployed in complex urban environments, necessitating effective coordination mechanisms to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for coordinating AVs at intersections. Our approach, 'CoMA', leverages graph neural networks to model the dynamic interactions among AVs and the environment, enabling scalable and adaptive decision-making. Experimental results using a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate that CoMA reduces congestion and collision rates compared to traditional rule-based approaches, while requiring minimal communication overhead.
