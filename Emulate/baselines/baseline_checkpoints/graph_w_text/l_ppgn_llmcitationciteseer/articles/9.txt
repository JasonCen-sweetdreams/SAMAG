Real-time database replication is crucial for many applications, but conflict resolution remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'CRISP', which leverages machine learning-based prediction models to anticipate and resolve conflicts proactively. CRISP integrates a probabilistic conflict detection mechanism with a multi-version concurrency control protocol, enabling efficient and scalable replication in high-throughput environments. Our experiments on a simulated e-commerce platform demonstrate that CRISP reduces conflict resolution latency by up to 75% compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining high data consistency and availability.
