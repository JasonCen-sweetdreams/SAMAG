Neural ranking models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but their computational complexity hinders their adoption in large-scale search engines. This paper presents a novel indexing strategy, 'NeurIX', which leverages the inherent structure of neural networks to reduce the number of required model evaluations. We propose a hierarchical indexing scheme that caches intermediate representations and employs a probabilistic pruning mechanism to eliminate irrelevant documents. Experimental results on a large web corpus demonstrate that NeurIX achieves significant speedups over existing indexing methods while maintaining retrieval effectiveness.
