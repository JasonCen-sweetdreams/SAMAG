Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization in distributed relational databases. We model the query plan as a graph and apply graph-based heuristics to minimize the communication cost and maximize parallelism. Experimental results on a realistic dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
