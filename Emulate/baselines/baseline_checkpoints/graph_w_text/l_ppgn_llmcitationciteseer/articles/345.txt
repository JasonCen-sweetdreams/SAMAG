Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in document retrieval tasks, but their computational complexity hinders their deployment in real-world search engines. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HNR', which leverages a two-stage ranking architecture to reduce the number of document evaluations while maintaining retrieval effectiveness. The first stage employs a lightweight neural scorer to filter out irrelevant documents, and the second stage utilizes a more accurate but computationally expensive model to re-rank the top candidates. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNR achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency while maintaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art models.
