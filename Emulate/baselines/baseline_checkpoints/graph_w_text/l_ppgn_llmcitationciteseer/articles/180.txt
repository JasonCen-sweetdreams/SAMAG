Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, as the scale of these databases grows, query optimization becomes a significant bottleneck. This paper presents 'GraphOpt', a novel distributed query optimization framework for scalable graph databases. GraphOpt leverages a combination of graph partitioning, parallel query execution, and dynamic query rewriting to achieve up to 5x performance improvement over state-of-the-art query optimizers. We evaluate GraphOpt on a large-scale social network dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing query latency and improving system throughput.
