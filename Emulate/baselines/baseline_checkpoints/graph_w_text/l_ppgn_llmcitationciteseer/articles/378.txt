Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 50 participants, analyzing their behavioral and physiological responses to customized avatars. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, reduced anxiety, and improved overall satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems and provide recommendations for future research.
