Virtual Reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but existing interaction modalities often fall short in terms of user experience. This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles to VR interaction, focusing on gesture-based interfaces. We design and evaluate a novel VR system that leverages hand and arm gestures to facilitate intuitive object manipulation and navigation. Our user study reveals significant improvements in user engagement, task performance, and overall satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of more immersive and effective VR experiences.
