Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, particularly in specialized domains where terminology is nuanced. This paper proposes a novel neural embedding-based approach, 'DomainEmb', which learns to represent domain-specific keywords and phrases in a dense vector space. By leveraging these embeddings, our method generates high-quality expansion terms that capture subtle semantic relationships, leading to significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experimental results on a large-scale biomedical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DomainEmb in retrieving relevant documents, outperforming traditional lexical-based and knowledge graph-based expansion techniques.
