Distributed relational databases are increasingly popular for large-scale data processing, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper presents 'RL-QOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workloads and database configurations. Our approach uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy for selecting optimal query plans, considering factors such as data distribution, network latency, and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional cost-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource efficiency.
