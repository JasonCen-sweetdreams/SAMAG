The proliferation of IoT devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation mechanisms that can adapt to dynamic environments. This paper presents a novel autonomous agent-based approach, 'AARA', which leverages multi-agent systems to allocate resources in real-time. AARA agents employ a decentralized, self-organizing architecture that facilitates robust and scalable decision-making. We evaluate AARA using a simulated IoT testbed and demonstrate improved resource utilization, reduced latency, and enhanced system resilience compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
