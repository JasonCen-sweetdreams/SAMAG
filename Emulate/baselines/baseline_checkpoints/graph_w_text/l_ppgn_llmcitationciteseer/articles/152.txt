Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between massive datasets. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity of graph structures and the need for distributed processing. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization, query rewriting, and cost-based optimization techniques to improve query performance by up to 3x compared to existing approaches. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world social network dataset and demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness in handling complex graph queries.
