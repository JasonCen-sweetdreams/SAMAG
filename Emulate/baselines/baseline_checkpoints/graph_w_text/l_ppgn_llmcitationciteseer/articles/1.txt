Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has gained popularity in recommendation systems due to its ability to incorporate semantic relationships between entities. However, existing KGE methods often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel graph attention network-based KGE approach, called GraphAtt-KGE, which leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant graph neighborhoods and reduce computational overhead. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphAtt-KGE achieves state-of-the-art performance in recommendation tasks while reducing computational time by up to 60% compared to existing methods.
