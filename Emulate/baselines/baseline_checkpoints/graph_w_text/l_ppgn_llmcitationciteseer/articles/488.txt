As the global population ages, there is a growing need for authentication methods that are accessible and secure for older adults. This paper presents a gesture-based authentication system designed specifically for older adults, leveraging HCI principles to minimize cognitive load and error rates. We conducted a usability study with 30 participants aged 65+, evaluating the system's performance and comparing it to traditional password-based authentication. Our results show that the gesture-based system significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of login success rates and user satisfaction, while maintaining robust security against shoulder-surfing attacks.
