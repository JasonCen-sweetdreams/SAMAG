Virtual reality (VR) has transformative potential, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an emotive avatar framework, 'EmoVR', which leverages affective computing and social presence theory to create more relatable and engaging virtual agents. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, demonstrating that EmoVR avatars elicit stronger emotional responses and increase user motivation compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our findings have implications for VR-based education, therapy, and entertainment applications.
