Main-memory database systems have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics, but indexing time-series data remains a significant challenge. Existing indexing techniques are often memory-inefficient or sacrifice query performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'TSMatrix', which exploits the inherent patterns in time-series data to achieve a better trade-off between memory usage and query performance. We introduce a matrix-based indexing structure that adaptively adjusts to the data distribution and query patterns, resulting in improved query throughput and reduced memory footprint. Experimental evaluation on real-world time-series datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of TSMatrix in supporting high-performance analytics workloads.
