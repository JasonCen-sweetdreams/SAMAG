Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion based on latent semantic analysis (LSA), which models the semantic relationships between terms in a high-dimensional vector space. We introduce a probabilistic framework that integrates LSA with a relevance feedback mechanism, allowing the system to adapt to user preferences and iteratively refine the query representation. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
