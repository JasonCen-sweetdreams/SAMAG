Traditional document ranking models often fail to capture the multifaceted nature of user information needs. This paper proposes a neural document ranking approach, HierAspRank, which incorporates hierarchical aspect modeling to better align retrieved documents with user queries. Our model learns to represent documents as a hierarchical composition of aspects, enabling more fine-grained matching with query facets. Experimental results on the TREC Deep Learning Track dataset demonstrate significant improvements in ranking performance and facet-level relevance over state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
