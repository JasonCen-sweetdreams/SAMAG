In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that involves assigning tasks to agents in a way that maximizes efficiency and minimizes communication overhead. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation algorithm inspired by ant colony optimization. Each agent maintains a local pheromone trail that guides task allocation decisions, and agents communicate through indirect interactions. We show that our approach outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our algorithm.
