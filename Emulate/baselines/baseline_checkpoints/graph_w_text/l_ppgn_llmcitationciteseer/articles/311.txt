As virtual reality (VR) technology advances, human-robot collaboration (HRC) in VR environments is becoming increasingly important. This paper explores the impact of embodiment on HRC in VR, where humans and robots work together to accomplish tasks. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR platform that enables real-time communication and collaboration between humans and robots. Our results show that embodied robots, which have a physical presence in the VR environment, lead to higher user satisfaction, trust, and task performance compared to non-embodied robots. We also identify key design factors that influence embodiment effects, including robot appearance, movement, and interaction cues.
