Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of cardinality estimation. This paper proposes an adaptive cardinality estimation technique, ACE, which leverages machine learning and statistical models to accurately estimate the cardinality of intermediate results. ACE dynamically adjusts to changes in data distribution and query patterns, outperforming traditional methods in terms of query execution time and resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world DDS platform demonstrate the efficacy of ACE in improving query performance and scalability.
