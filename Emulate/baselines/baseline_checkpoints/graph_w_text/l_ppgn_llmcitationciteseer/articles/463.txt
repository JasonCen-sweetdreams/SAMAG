Individuals with motor impairments often struggle to interact with technology due to limited dexterity or mobility. This paper presents an adaptive gestural interface framework, 'GestARL', that utilizes reinforcement learning to personalize user interfaces for assistive technology. GestARL learns to recognize and adapt to unique gestural patterns, enabling more accurate and efficient interaction. We evaluate GestARL on a dataset of users with cerebral palsy, demonstrating significant improvements in interaction time and accuracy compared to traditional interface designs.
