Virtual reality (VR) technology has made significant strides in recent years, but the importance of embodiment in VR experiences remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining the effects of embodied interaction on user experience in VR. We designed three VR scenarios with varying levels of embodiment, from low (controller-based) to high (full-body tracking), and collected both quantitative and qualitative data from 30 participants. Our results show that increased embodiment leads to higher user engagement, presence, and overall satisfaction, while also influencing users' emotional responses to virtual stimuli. The findings have implications for the design of future VR systems and applications.
