Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often suffer from vocabulary mismatch between queries and documents, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'WEMbed', which leverages word embeddings to effectively capture semantic relationships between terms. WEMbed uses a combination of local and global context-aware embeddings to generate a weighted set of expansion terms, which are then integrated into the original query. Experimental results on several standard TREC datasets demonstrate that WEMbed outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
