NoSQL databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics. However, query processing in these databases can be inefficient due to the lack of indexing mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'HIQ', that combines the benefits of tree-based and hash-based indexing techniques. HIQ is specifically designed for column-oriented NoSQL databases and leverages the characteristics of column stores to optimize query performance. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HIQ significantly outperforms existing indexing techniques in terms of query latency and throughput.
