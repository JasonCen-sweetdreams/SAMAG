Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised concerns. Existing defense mechanisms focus on local or global perturbations, neglecting the hierarchical structure of graphs. We propose a novel hierarchical defense mechanism, 'HierDef', which leverages the graph's hierarchical representation to detect and mitigate attacks. HierDef incorporates attention-based graph pooling to identify critical nodes and edges, and then applies a robustness-enhancing regularization technique to the affected subgraphs. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierDef outperforms existing defense methods in terms of robustness and accuracy.
