Distributed column-store databases have become increasingly popular for big data analytics, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'ColOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to predict query performance. ColOpt identifies the most efficient query execution plan by analyzing column-level statistics, data distribution, and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColOpt reduces query latency by up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques, while maintaining high accuracy and robustness.
