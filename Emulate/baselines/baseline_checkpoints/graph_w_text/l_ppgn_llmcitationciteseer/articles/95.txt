Query-based summarization has become a crucial task in Information Retrieval (IR) due to the exponential growth of digital content. This paper proposes a novel approach, GuidedDoc, which leverages query-dependent document expansion to improve the quality and efficiency of summarization. By incorporating keyphrase extraction and semantic role labeling, GuidedDoc selectively expands relevant documents to better capture the context and intent behind the query. Experimental results on the TREC news dataset demonstrate significant improvements in ROUGE scores and query relevance, while reducing computational overhead.
