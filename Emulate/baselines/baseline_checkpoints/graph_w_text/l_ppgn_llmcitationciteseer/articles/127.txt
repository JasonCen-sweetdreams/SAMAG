Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have revolutionized the way humans interact with digital information. However, the lack of personalized experiences in VR can lead to user frustration and decreased engagement. This study explores the effect of personalization on user experience in VR interfaces. We designed and implemented a VR system that adapts to individual users' preferences, learning styles, and cognitive abilities. Our user study with 30 participants reveals that personalized VR interfaces significantly enhance user satisfaction, reduce cognitive load, and improve task performance. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems and highlight areas for further research.
