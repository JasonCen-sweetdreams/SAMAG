The rapid growth of COVID-19 research literature has created a significant challenge for researchers to identify relevant studies. This paper introduces a novel query expansion approach, 'COVID-Expand', that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of keywords and expand user queries. Our method utilizes a combination of context-aware embeddings and attention mechanisms to capture nuanced relationships between terms. Experimental results on a large COVID-19 literature dataset demonstrate that COVID-Expand outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision and a 17% increase in recall.
