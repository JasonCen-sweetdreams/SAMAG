In modern information retrieval systems, the curse of dimensionality poses significant challenges for efficient document ranking. We propose a novel neural ranking model, ElasticRank, which leverages deep neural networks to learn a flexible, hierarchical representation of documents. By incorporating a carefully designed attention mechanism, ElasticRank adaptively focuses on relevant features in high-dimensional spaces, enabling accurate ranking with reduced computational cost. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ElasticRank in improving retrieval efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art ranking performance.
