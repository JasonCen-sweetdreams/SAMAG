Distributed databases pose significant query optimization challenges due to varying data distributions, network latencies, and workload dynamics. This paper presents 'RL-QOpt', a novel adaptive query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed settings. RL-QOpt uses a deep Q-network to learn from query execution feedback, adapt to changing database conditions, and improve query performance. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database show that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in query latency and 25% in resource utilization.
