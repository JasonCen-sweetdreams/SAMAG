This paper presents a novel approach to document retrieval using deep neural ranking models with hyperbolic embeddings. We propose a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures the semantic relationships between queries and documents in a hyperbolic space, allowing for more accurate and efficient retrieval. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art models, while also reducing the computational complexity. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the learned hyperbolic embeddings, shedding light on the role of curvature in capturing document semantics.
