The proliferation of large-scale RDF datasets has created a need for efficient query optimization techniques in distributed database systems. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to optimize query plans for distributed RDF databases. We design a GNN architecture that learns to predict optimal query plans based on graph structural features and query patterns. Our experimental results on the WatDiv benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while also achieving better scalability and robustness.
