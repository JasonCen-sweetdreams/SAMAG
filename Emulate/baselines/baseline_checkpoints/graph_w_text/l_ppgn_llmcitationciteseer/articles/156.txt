Node classification in heterogeneous graphs is a challenging task due to the presence of multiple node and edge types. Recent approaches have leveraged graph attention networks (GATs) to learn node representations, but they fail to capture hierarchical relationships between nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that incorporates hierarchical attention mechanisms to learn node representations at multiple scales. We evaluate HGAT on three real-world datasets and demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art GAT-based methods. Our approach has applications in recommender systems, social network analysis, and knowledge graph completion.
