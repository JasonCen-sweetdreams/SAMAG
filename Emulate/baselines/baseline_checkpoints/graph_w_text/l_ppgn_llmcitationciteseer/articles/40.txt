This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, 'Dec-MADRL', which enables agents to learn cooperative strategies for task allocation in complex, dynamic environments. Dec-MADRL combines graph neural networks with deep Q-networks to learn a distributed task allocation policy, allowing agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental constraints. Experimental results using a simulated robotics testbed demonstrate the effectiveness of Dec-MADRL in improving task completion rates and reducing agent collisions compared to centralized optimization methods.
