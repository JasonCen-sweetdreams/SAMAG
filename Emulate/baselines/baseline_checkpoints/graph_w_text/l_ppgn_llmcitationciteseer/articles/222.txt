Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large, heterogeneous graphs. This paper proposes a novel entity disambiguation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) and knowledge graph embeddings. Our approach, called 'GED-GNN', represents entities as graph-structured data and utilizes GNNs to learn entity representations that capture both local and global graph properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GED-GNN on two large-scale knowledge graphs, achieving state-of-the-art performance and significant scalability improvements over existing methods.
