Query optimization is a crucial component in distributed database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to optimize query plans. Our methodology, called 'GNN-QO', represents the database schema and query workload as a graph, and uses a GNN to predict the optimal query plan. We evaluate GNN-QO on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
