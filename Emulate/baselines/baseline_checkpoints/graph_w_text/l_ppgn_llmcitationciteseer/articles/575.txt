Virtual Reality (VR) has shown immense potential in various domains, but user engagement remains a significant concern. This paper explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR. We designed an experimental study where participants interacted with a VR environment using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results indicate that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, measured through metrics such as interaction time, emotional arousal, and self-reported presence. We also identify key factors contributing to this effect, including avatar similarity, customization options, and social presence cues. The findings have implications for the design of VR systems and applications, particularly in fields like education, therapy, and entertainment.
