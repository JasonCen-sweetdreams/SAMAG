Anomaly detection in high-dimensional data streams is a challenging task due to the curse of dimensionality and concept drift. This paper proposes an online isolation forest algorithm, 'OiF', which leverages the strengths of isolation forest and online learning. OiF adaptively updates the isolation forest model as new data arrives, using a novel incremental learning strategy that balances model accuracy and computational efficiency. Our experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that OiF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy, speed, and memory usage.
