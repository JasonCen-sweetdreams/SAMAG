Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but existing methods often rely on handcrafted rules or simplistic statistical models. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal query expansion strategies. By formulating query expansion as a Markov Decision Process, we train a deep Q-network to select the most informative terms and weights for a given query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving improvements in both precision and recall.
