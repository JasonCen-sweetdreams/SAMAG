This paper presents a novel framework for coordinating multi-agent systems (MAS) using adaptive social network analysis. We leverage graph neural networks to model agent interactions and adaptively learn the social structure of the MAS. Our approach, called Adaptive Social Network-based Coordination (ASNC), enables agents to dynamically adjust their behavior based on the evolving social network. We evaluate ASNC in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved coordination and response times compared to traditional distributed coordination methods.
