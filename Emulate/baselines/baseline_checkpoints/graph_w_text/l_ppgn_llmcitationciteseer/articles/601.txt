Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based applications. However, their robustness to adversarial attacks remains a concern. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention mechanism to enhance the adversarial robustness of GNNs. Our approach leverages attention weights to identify and down-weight noisy or anomalous nodes, thereby improving the model's resilience to targeted attacks. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in robustness while maintaining competitive performance on clean data.
