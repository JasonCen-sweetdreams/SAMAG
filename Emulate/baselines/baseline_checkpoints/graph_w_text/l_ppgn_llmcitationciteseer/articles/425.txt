Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages hierarchical graph representations to reduce the computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. HGAT uses a multi-scale attention mechanism to aggregate features from neighboring nodes at different hierarchical levels, allowing it to capture both local and global graph structures. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
