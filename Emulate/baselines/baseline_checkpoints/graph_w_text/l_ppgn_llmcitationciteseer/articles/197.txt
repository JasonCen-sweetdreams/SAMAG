Object detection in images remains a challenging task, particularly when dealing with large, complex scenes. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HierDet', which leverages hierarchical knowledge graph embeddings to improve detection accuracy and scalability. By representing objects as nodes in a graph, we can capture semantic relationships between entities and contexts, enabling more informed feature extraction and bounding box prediction. Our experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate significant improvements in AP and AR scores, especially for rare and occluded objects, while achieving real-time performance on modern GPU architectures.
