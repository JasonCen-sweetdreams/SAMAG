We present a novel decentralized autonomous agent-based system for real-time resource allocation in dynamic environments. Our approach leverages multi-agent negotiation protocols and distributed constraint optimization to allocate resources efficiently and adapt to changes in the environment. We evaluate our system in a simulated smart grid scenario, demonstrating improved responsiveness and reduced resource waste compared to traditional centralized approaches. The proposed framework has implications for various applications, including smart cities, logistics, and robotics.
