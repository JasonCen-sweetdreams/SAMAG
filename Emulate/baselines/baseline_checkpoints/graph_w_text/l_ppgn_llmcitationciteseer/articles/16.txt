Multi-agent systems (MAS) often require efficient task allocation to achieve global objectives. This paper presents a novel hierarchical task allocation framework that leverages distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) techniques. By modeling task dependencies as constraints, our approach enables agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a decentralized manner, ensuring feasibility and optimality. Experimental results on a logistics scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms centralized task allocation methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
