Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. Traditional QE methods rely on statistical techniques, neglecting the semantic relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'SemQE', which leverages deep learning-based semantic embeddings to capture nuanced query semantics. Our method integrates a pre-trained language model with a relevance-based feedback loop, refining the query representation to better match relevant documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art QE methods.
