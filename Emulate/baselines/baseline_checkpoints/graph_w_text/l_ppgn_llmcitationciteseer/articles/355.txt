Real-time data warehousing has become a critical component in modern business intelligence applications. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a major bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages the benefits of column stores to accelerate query processing. We introduce a cost-based optimization technique that considers both storage and computational costs, resulting in significant performance improvements. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that ColOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x, making it suitable for large-scale, real-time data warehousing applications.
