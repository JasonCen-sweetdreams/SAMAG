Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a popular technique to improve retrieval performance, but it often relies on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well across different query types. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework, NEQE, which leverages pre-trained language models to learn dense embeddings for queries and documents. We introduce a novel attention-based mechanism to selectively expand queries with relevant terms, and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional query expansion methods on several benchmark datasets.
