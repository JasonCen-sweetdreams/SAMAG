Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-structured data tasks. However, recent studies have shown that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their reliability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a novel topology-aware adversarial training framework for GNNs, which leverages the structural properties of graphs to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. Our approach incorporates a topology-based perturbation strategy that adapts to the graph structure, resulting in more effective and efficient adversarial training. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the robustness of GNNs against various types of adversarial attacks.
