Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design a reinforcement learning algorithm that learns to select optimal query plans based on graph statistics and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
