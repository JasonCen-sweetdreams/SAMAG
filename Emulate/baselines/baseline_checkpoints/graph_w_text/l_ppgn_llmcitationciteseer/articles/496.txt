This paper proposes a novel decentralized approach for coalition formation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, called Decentralized Coalition Optimization (DCO), enables agents to learn cooperative policies in a distributed manner without relying on a centralized controller. We employ a hierarchical framework consisting of a high-level coalition formation module and a low-level task allocation module. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that DCO achieves significant improvements in coalition stability and task efficiency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
