Distributed column-oriented databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data analytics. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and dynamic reordering of join operations. We propose a graph-based approach to model the query optimization problem and develop an efficient algorithm to find near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average reduction of 30% in query execution time.
