Few-shot natural language processing (NLP) has gained significant attention in recent years. However, most existing approaches rely on complex task-specific architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning framework, 'HiTE', which leverages hierarchical task embeddings to adapt to new NLP tasks with only a few examples. Our approach enables the model to capture task relationships and transfer knowledge across tasks, resulting in improved performance on a range of benchmark datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HiTE on several few-shot NLP tasks, including text classification, sentiment analysis, and question answering.
