Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem in many real-world applications. However, traditional methods often struggle with few-shot scenarios, where limited data is available. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach, 'MetaTSF', which leverages uncertainty estimation to adapt to new time series datasets with limited observations. Our framework consists of a probabilistic neural network that learns to generate uncertainty-aware forecasts, and a meta-learning module that adapts the model to new datasets using Bayesian inference. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaTSF in improving forecasting accuracy and uncertainty estimation in few-shot settings.
