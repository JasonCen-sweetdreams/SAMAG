Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but personalized experiences can have unintended consequences on user engagement. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining the effects of personalization on user engagement in VR interfaces. We developed a VR platform that adapts to individual user preferences and conducted a user study with 30 participants. Our results show that while personalization generally increases user engagement, it can also lead to a sense of discomfort and unease, particularly among users with high levels of anxiety. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR interfaces and propose guidelines for creating personalized VR experiences that balance user engagement with user comfort.
