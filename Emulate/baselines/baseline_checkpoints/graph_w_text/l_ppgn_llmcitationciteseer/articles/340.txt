As NoSQL databases continue to grow in popularity, optimizing query performance becomes increasingly critical. This paper presents 'AdaptIx', a novel indexing framework designed for distributed NoSQL databases. AdaptIx dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns, data distribution, and system workload, resulting in improved query response times and reduced resource utilization. Our evaluation on a large-scale Apache Cassandra cluster demonstrates that AdaptIx outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 35% in query latency and 27% in resource usage.
