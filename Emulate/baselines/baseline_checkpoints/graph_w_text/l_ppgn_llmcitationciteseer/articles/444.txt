Ad-hoc search systems struggle to retrieve relevant documents when users submit ambiguous or incomplete queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to automatically generate effective expansion terms. Our model learns to balance the trade-off between query drift and relevance by interacting with a simulated search environment. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
