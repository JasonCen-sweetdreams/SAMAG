Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their reliability in critical applications. This paper presents a novel approach for detecting such attacks using hierarchical temporal convolutional networks (HTCNs). Our method leverages the temporal dependencies in the input data to identify subtle patterns indicative of adversarial perturbations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods, achieving an average detection accuracy of 95.2% while maintaining a low false positive rate.
