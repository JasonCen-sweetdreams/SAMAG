Virtual reality (VR) systems often struggle to accurately recognize user gestures, leading to frustrating interactions. This paper presents a novel approach that incorporates personalized haptic feedback to improve gesture recognition in VR. Our system, 'HapGR', uses a machine learning model to learn users' individual gesture patterns and adapt haptic cues to provide real-time feedback. We conducted a user study with 30 participants and demonstrated a significant reduction in gesture recognition errors (25.1%) compared to a baseline VR system. Our results show that HapGR enhances the overall VR experience, enabling more intuitive and effective user interactions.
