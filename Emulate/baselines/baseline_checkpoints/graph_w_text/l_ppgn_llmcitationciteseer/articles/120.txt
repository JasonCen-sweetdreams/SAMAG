Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) have become a crucial component of modern information retrieval systems. However, existing ranking models struggle to capture the complex relationships between different types of nodes and edges in HINs. In this paper, we propose a deep ranking model, HINRank, which leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to learn node representations that capture both structural and semantic relationships in HINs. Our experiments on a large-scale dataset of scholarly articles demonstrate that HINRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
