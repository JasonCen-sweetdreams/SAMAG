In dynamic environments, autonomous agents face the challenge of efficiently allocating tasks while adapting to changing conditions. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework, 'DynaTA', which leverages multi-agent learning and graph theory to optimize task assignments. DynaTA enables agents to learn from experience and communicate with each other to resolve conflicts, resulting in improved task completion rates and reduced latency. We evaluate DynaTA in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating its effectiveness in coping with uncertain and dynamic environments.
