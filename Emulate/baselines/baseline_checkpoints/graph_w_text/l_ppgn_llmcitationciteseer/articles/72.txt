Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, but its robustness to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. This paper proposes a novel constrained policy optimization approach, 'ARPO', to enhance the robustness of DRL policies against adversarial perturbations. We formulate the problem as a constrained Markov decision process and develop an efficient algorithm to optimize the policy under attack constraints. Experimental results on Atari games and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that ARPO significantly improves the robustness of DRL policies while maintaining their performance.
