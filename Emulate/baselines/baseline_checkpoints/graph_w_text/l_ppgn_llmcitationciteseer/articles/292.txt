Autonomous vehicles require real-time control systems that can adapt to complex, dynamic environments. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'AVRL', which leverages a hybrid Actor-Critic architecture to optimize vehicle control policies. We introduce a new reward function that balances safety, efficiency, and comfort, and demonstrate improved performance compared to traditional model-based control methods. AVRL is evaluated on a realistic simulation platform, showcasing its potential for real-world deployment.
