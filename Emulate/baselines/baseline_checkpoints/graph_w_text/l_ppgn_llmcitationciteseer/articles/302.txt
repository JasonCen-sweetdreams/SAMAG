Dialogue systems that collaborate with humans can significantly improve task efficiency. However, current systems often rely on manual turn-taking, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel human-AI collaboration framework, 'TaskAlign', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize dialogue flow and task allocation. TaskAlign incorporates a neural network-based dialogue manager that adaptively adjusts its strategy based on user feedback and task progress. Experimental results on a task-oriented dialogue dataset demonstrate that TaskAlign achieves a 25% reduction in task completion time and a 15% increase in user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art systems.
