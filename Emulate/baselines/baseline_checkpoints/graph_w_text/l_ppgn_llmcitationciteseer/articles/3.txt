This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed an experiment to investigate how users' bodily experiences influence their cognitive processing of virtual objects. Our results show that participants who used gesture-based interaction exhibited improved spatial reasoning and object recognition compared to those using traditional controllers. We also found that the sense of agency and embodiment in VR is closely tied to the user's sense of self. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to enhance cognitive performance and user engagement.
