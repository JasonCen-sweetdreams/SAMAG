Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-based machine learning, but existing methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper presents a novel approach to robust node classification, incorporating hierarchical graph attention and adversarial training. We propose a graph attention mechanism that captures hierarchical relationships between nodes and a robust loss function that accounts for adversarial perturbations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving node classification accuracy under adversarial attacks.
