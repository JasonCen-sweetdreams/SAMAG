This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for autonomous agents using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the agent network as a graph and learn a task allocation policy using a GNN-based architecture. Our approach enables agents to adapt to changing task requirements and network topologies without relying on a centralized controller. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm show that our method outperforms traditional decentralized allocation strategies in terms of task completion efficiency and robustness to agent failures.
