Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used to manage large-scale data applications. However, query processing in DDS faces significant challenges due to data distribution, network latency, and node failures. This paper proposes an adaptive caching and replication scheme, called 'DynaCache', to optimize query performance in DDS. DynaCache dynamically adjusts cache sizes and replication factors based on query patterns, data access frequencies, and system workload. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that DynaCache achieves up to 35% reduction in query latency and 25% improvement in throughput compared to existing caching and replication strategies.
