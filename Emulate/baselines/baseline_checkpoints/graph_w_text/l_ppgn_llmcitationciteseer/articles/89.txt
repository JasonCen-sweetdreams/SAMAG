Coordinated multi-agent pathfinding is a challenging problem in real-world environments, where agents must avoid collisions with each other and dynamic obstacles. This paper presents a novel approach, 'MAPDO', that integrates graph-based path planning with model predictive control to enable efficient and safe navigation. We propose a decentralized communication protocol that enables agents to share intentions and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results in a warehouse scenario demonstrate that MAPDO outperforms existing methods in terms of success rate, path length, and computational efficiency.
