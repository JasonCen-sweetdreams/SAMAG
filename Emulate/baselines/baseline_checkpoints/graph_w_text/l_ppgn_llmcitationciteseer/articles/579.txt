This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating accessible gestural interfaces for older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 older adults with varying levels of motor impairment, resulting in the development of a gestural interface framework that incorporates compensatory strategies and adaptive feedback mechanisms. A usability evaluation of the framework with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing gesture-based systems. Our findings have implications for the design of inclusive and accessible interfaces for older adults with motor impairments.
