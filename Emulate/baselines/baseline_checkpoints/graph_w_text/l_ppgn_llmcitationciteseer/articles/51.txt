Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages neural embeddings to model term semantics. By incorporating a pre-trained language model into the query expansion process, NeuroQE can effectively capture latent relationships between terms and improve retrieval performance. Our experiments on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and recall compared to traditional query expansion methods.
