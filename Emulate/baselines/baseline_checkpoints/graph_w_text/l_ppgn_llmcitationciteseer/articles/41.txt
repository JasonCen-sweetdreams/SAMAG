Document retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval (IR) systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HNRM, which leverages query expansion and document embeddings to improve retrieval efficiency and accuracy. HNRM incorporates a query-dependent attention mechanism to adaptively weight document terms and a hierarchical ranking strategy to prune irrelevant documents. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that HNRM outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of retrieval speed and effectiveness, while achieving competitive performance on standard IR metrics.
