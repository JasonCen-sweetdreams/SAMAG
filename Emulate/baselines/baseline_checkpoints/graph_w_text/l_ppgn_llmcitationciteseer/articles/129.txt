The increasing volume and velocity of big data pose significant challenges to traditional query optimization techniques. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to accelerate query processing in big data analytics. We design a neural network-based index model that learns to predict the optimal query execution plan from historical query patterns and data distributions. Our experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
