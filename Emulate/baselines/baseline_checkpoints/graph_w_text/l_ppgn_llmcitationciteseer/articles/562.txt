Autonomous vehicle platooning has the potential to significantly improve traffic flow and reduce fuel consumption. However, coordinating the actions of multiple vehicles in a platoon remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework for autonomous vehicle platooning. We model the platooning task as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and develop a novel algorithm that integrates deep Q-networks with graph attention mechanisms. Our approach enables efficient and scalable coordination of autonomous vehicles in a platoon, outperforming existing methods in simulations and experiments.
