Traditional learning-to-rank approaches for document search rely on pairwise or listwise training, which can be computationally expensive and limited in their ability to model complex relevance relationships. This paper proposes a novel deep retrieval-based neural ranking model, 'DRR', which leverages a dense passage retrieval approach to efficiently identify relevant documents. Our model utilizes a hierarchical transformer architecture to capture both local and global contextual information, and is trained using a contrastive learning objective that minimizes the distance between relevant document pairs. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DRR in improving search efficiency and ranking accuracy.
