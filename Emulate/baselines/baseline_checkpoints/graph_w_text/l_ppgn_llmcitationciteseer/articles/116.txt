Few-shot node classification is a challenging task in graph-structured data, where only a few labeled nodes are available for training. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) architecture that leverages both node and graph-level attention mechanisms to learn robust representations. Our approach adapts to new graphs and nodes by employing a meta-learning framework, which enables fast adaptation to new tasks with limited labeled data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN in few-shot node classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
