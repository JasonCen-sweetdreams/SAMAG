Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, as it requires models to adapt quickly to new tasks with limited training data. This paper proposes a hierarchical meta-learning framework, 'TaskAdapt', which learns to adapt model weights to new tasks by incorporating task-aware information. We introduce a novel weight adaptation mechanism that leverages task embeddings to adjust the learning rate and momentum of the optimizer. Experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that TaskAdapt outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods, achieving higher accuracy and faster adaptation to new tasks.
