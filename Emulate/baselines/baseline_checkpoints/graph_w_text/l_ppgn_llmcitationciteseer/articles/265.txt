In this paper, we tackle the problem of decentralized task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, which enables agents to learn optimal task allocation strategies in a distributed manner. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model the complex interactions between agents and tasks, and uses a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn policy and value functions. Experimental results on a series of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and adaptability to changing environments.
