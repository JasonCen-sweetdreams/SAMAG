Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing, but their quadratic complexity hinders their applicability to long sequences. This paper presents 'Hierarchical Attention with Efficient Reduction' (HAER), a novel architecture that tackles this limitation by introducing a hierarchical attention mechanism. HAER adaptively reduces the sequence length at each layer, significantly decreasing computational cost while maintaining performance. We evaluate HAER on various long-sequence NLP tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results on the WikiText-103 dataset and a 3x speedup over standard transformer models.
