As the global population ages, designing accessible and usable conversational interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments has become increasingly important. This paper presents a Human-Centered Design approach to create an inclusive conversational system, 'ElderChat', tailored to the needs of this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements. ElderChat incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified language processing, visual cues, and error forgiveness. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in conversational task completion rates and overall user satisfaction.
