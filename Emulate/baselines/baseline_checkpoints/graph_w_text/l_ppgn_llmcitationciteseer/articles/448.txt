Conventional query expansion techniques often prioritize relevance over diversity, leading to redundant search results. This paper proposes a context-aware query expansion framework, 'CAQE', which incorporates user context and search intent to generate diverse and relevant search results. CAQE leverages a hybrid approach combining word embeddings and knowledge graphs to capture semantic relationships between query terms and expand the query scope. Experimental results on a large-scale search engine dataset demonstrate that CAQE significantly improves search result diversity and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
