Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in node classification tasks, but often struggle to capture complex relationships between nodes. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, HAGNN, which leverages attention mechanisms at multiple scales to selectively focus on relevant nodes and their neighbors. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical clustering strategy to group nodes based on their structural and feature similarities, enabling the model to capture both local and global patterns. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in node classification tasks, particularly in scenarios with sparse node labels.
