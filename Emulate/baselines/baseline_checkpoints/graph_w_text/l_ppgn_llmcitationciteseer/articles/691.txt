The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles has introduced new challenges in managing energy resources in smart grids. This paper presents a decentralized coordination framework for autonomous agents, enabling them to optimize resource allocation in real-time. Our approach leverages a novel auction-based mechanism, which considers both physical grid constraints and agent preferences. Experimental results on a realistic grid simulation demonstrate significant improvements in energy efficiency, reduced congestion, and enhanced grid stability compared to traditional centralized approaches.
