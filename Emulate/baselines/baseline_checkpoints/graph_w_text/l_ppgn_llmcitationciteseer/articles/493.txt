The proliferation of gestural interfaces has transformed the way people interact with technology. However, individuals with motor impairments often face significant barriers when using these systems. This study investigates the usability and accessibility of a novel gestural interface, 'Easy Gesture', designed specifically for individuals with motor impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that Easy Gesture significantly reduced error rates and improved user satisfaction compared to existing commercial systems. Our results demonstrate the potential of tailored gestural interfaces to enhance the overall user experience for individuals with motor impairments.
