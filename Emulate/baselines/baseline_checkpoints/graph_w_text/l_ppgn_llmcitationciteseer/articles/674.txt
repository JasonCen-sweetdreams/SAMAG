Current information retrieval (IR) models often struggle to capture nuanced semantic relationships between documents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical contrastive learning framework, 'HiCoL', which leverages both local and global contextual information to improve retrieval performance. By integrating a contrastive objective into a hierarchical transformer architecture, HiCoL learns to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant documents at multiple granularities. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiCoL outperforms state-of-the-art IR models, particularly in scenarios involving ambiguous or multi-faceted queries.
