RDF graph processing has become increasingly important for large-scale data integration and analysis. However, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck, particularly in distributed settings. This paper presents a novel distributed query optimization framework, 'RDF-DistOpt', which leverages graph partitioning and parallel processing to accelerate SPARQL query execution. We introduce a cost-based optimization strategy that takes into account data locality, network communication, and processing capacity of individual nodes. Experimental results on a real-world RDF dataset demonstrate that RDF-DistOpt achieves up to 5x speedup compared to state-of-the-art centralized optimization techniques.
