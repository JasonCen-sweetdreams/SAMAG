Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by speech recognition errors and inadequate feedback mechanisms. This study investigates the impact of speech recognition accuracy and feedback strategies on the user experience of older adults interacting with voice assistants. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65-85, employing a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the effects of error rates and feedback types on user satisfaction, trust, and task completion. Our results show that personalized feedback strategies, such as semantic error correction and explicit error acknowledgment, significantly improve user experience and reduce frustration. We provide design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants tailored to the needs of older adults.
