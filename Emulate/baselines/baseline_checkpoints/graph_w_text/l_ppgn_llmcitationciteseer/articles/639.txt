As distributed database systems continue to grow in scale and complexity, query optimization has become a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal query plans based on runtime statistics and system workload. Experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization. We also demonstrate the adaptability of our approach to changing workload patterns and system configurations.
