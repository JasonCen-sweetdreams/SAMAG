As multi-agent systems become increasingly pervasive, there is a growing need for transparent and interpretable decision-making mechanisms. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent settings. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, while also providing insights into the decision-making process. We evaluate our HAN framework on a range of multi-agent scenarios, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability compared to existing methods.
