This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have different capabilities and resources. We leverage reinforcement learning to learn a policy that allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, workload, and communication constraints. The proposed approach, called 'DecentraAL', uses a novel reward function that encourages agents to share tasks and coordinate their actions to achieve global optimality. Experimental results on a simulated urban search and rescue scenario demonstrate that DecentraAL outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
