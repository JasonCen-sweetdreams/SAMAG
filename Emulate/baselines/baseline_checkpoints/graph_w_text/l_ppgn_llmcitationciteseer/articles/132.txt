Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by speech recognition inaccuracies. This study investigates the impact of age-related speech changes on voice assistant interactions. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, analyzing their speech patterns and evaluating the performance of three commercial voice assistants. Our results show that existing systems struggle to recognize older adults' speech, particularly with respect to pronunciation, vocabulary, and prosody. We propose a set of design recommendations for developing more inclusive voice assistants, including personalized acoustic models and adaptive error correction mechanisms.
