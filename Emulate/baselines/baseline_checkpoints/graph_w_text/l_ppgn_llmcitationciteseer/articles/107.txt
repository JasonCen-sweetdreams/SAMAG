Main-memory databases have revolutionized data processing by minimizing disk I/O. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'LearnedIndex', which leverages machine learning to optimize index structures for main-memory databases. By learning the underlying data distribution, our method adaptively constructs a hybrid index that combines the benefits of B-trees and hash tables, achieving up to 3x query performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques. We conduct an extensive evaluation on real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of LearnedIndex in various query scenarios.
