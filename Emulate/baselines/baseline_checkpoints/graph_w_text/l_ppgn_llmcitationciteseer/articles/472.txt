Entity disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in large-scale knowledge graphs, where ambiguous entities can lead to inaccurate query results. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphEmbDQ', which integrates graph-based entity embeddings with distributed query optimization to achieve scalable entity disambiguation. We design a hierarchical graph neural network to learn entity representations, and a distributed query optimization framework to efficiently prune the search space. Experimental results on the YAGO knowledge graph demonstrate that GraphEmbDQ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability, while reducing query execution time by up to 3x.
