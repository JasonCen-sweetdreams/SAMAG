Query optimization is a crucial step in scalable processing of large RDF graphs. Existing approaches often rely on heuristics or manual tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based query optimizer, 'RLQO', for distributed RDF graphs. RLQO learns to predict the optimal query plan by interacting with the database environment and receiving rewards based on execution time and resource utilization. We evaluate RLQO on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
