This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. Our proposed framework, 'RL-MASTA', enables agents to learn optimal task assignments in real-time, adapting to dynamic changes in the environment and agent capabilities. We introduce a decentralized, asynchronous learning protocol that leverages sparse rewards and communication constraints to improve task allocation efficiency. Experimental results on a realistic logistics scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to traditional auction-based approaches.
