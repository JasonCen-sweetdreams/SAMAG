With the increasing adoption of RDF graph databases in various applications, optimizing query performance becomes a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RDFox', which leverages graph partitioning and parallel processing to accelerate query execution in distributed RDF graph databases. We introduce a cost-based optimization strategy that takes into account data distribution, query patterns, and node connectivity to minimize data transfer and processing overhead. Experimental results on large-scale RDF datasets demonstrate that RDFox outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 50% in terms of query response time.
