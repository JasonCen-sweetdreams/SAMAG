Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their effectiveness for older adults with cognitive impairments is hindered by limitations in speech recognition, dialogue flow, and overall usability. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EASE', a novel voice interface specifically tailored to the needs of this population. EASE incorporates a cognitive load-aware dialogue manager, adaptive speech recognition thresholds, and personalized feedback mechanisms to facilitate successful interactions. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates, user satisfaction, and perceived cognitive load compared to commercial voice assistants.
