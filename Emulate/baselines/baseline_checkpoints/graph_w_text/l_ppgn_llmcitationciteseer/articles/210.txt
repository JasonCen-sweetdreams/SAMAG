Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their responses often lack empathy, leading to user frustration and disengagement. This paper presents 'EmpaVoice', a novel framework that generates empathetic responses to user queries. We employ a multi-task learning approach, combining emotional intelligence with natural language understanding to create more compassionate and personalized interactions. Our user study with 100 participants demonstrates that EmpaVoice significantly improves user satisfaction and perceived empathy compared to existing voice assistants. We also provide design guidelines for inclusive voice interface development.
