In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize agent performance. Our approach, called 'AgentDRL', uses a decentralized actor-critic architecture to enable agents to learn task allocation policies from local observations and interactions. We evaluate AgentDRL on a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
