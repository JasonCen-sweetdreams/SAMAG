Resource allocation is a critical challenge in IoT networks, where agents with conflicting goals compete for limited resources. This paper proposes a novel decentralized negotiation framework that enables agents to negotiate and allocate resources efficiently. We introduce a hybrid negotiation strategy that combines heuristic-based and machine learning-based approaches to adapt to dynamic network conditions. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that our framework achieves improved resource utilization and reduced negotiation time compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
