Short-text retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, due to the limited context and lack of relevant keywords. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'GraphExpan', that leverages graph-based embeddings to capture semantic relationships between keywords. Our method represents queries as graphs, where nodes correspond to keywords and edges denote co-occurrence and semantic relationships. We then use graph convolutional networks to learn dense embeddings for each node, which are used to expand the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, improving retrieval performance by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
