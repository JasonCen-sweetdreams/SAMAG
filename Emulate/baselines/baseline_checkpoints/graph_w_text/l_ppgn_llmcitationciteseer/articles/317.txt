Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis, but existing methods struggle with unbalanced datasets. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepHClust', which leverages deep embeddings to learn a hierarchical representation of the data. Our method employs a multi-resolution strategy to adapt to varying density regions, and a novel loss function that encourages balanced clustering. Experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that DeepHClust outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and scalability, particularly for datasets with extreme class imbalance.
