Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from its benefits. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces that cater to users with visual impairments. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 participants with visual impairments and developed a set of guidelines for accessible VR interaction techniques. Our approach incorporates audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized customization options. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces.
