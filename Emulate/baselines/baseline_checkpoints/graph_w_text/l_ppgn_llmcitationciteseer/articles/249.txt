Query expansion is a crucial component of information retrieval systems, as it helps to improve the retrieval accuracy by incorporating additional relevant terms. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'SemEx', which leverages semantic embeddings to learn the contextual relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Our method uses a combination of word2vec and graph convolutional networks to capture the semantic nuances of the query and documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemEx outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision and recall.
