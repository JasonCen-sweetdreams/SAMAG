Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize social interactions, but current systems often exclude users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) that promote inclusivity in VR environments. We propose a multimodal interaction model that integrates speech, gesture, and gaze cues to facilitate more natural and accessible human-agent communication. Our user study with participants with and without disabilities demonstrates that our ECA design improves social presence, trust, and overall user experience in VR. The findings have significant implications for the development of inclusive and accessible VR applications.
