As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, the importance of effective human-robot collaboration (HRC) in VR environments grows. This paper explores the role of embodiment in HRC, examining how robot anthropomorphism and human embodiment in VR affect collaboration outcomes. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a mixed-design experiment to manipulate robot anthropomorphism and human embodiment. Our results show that embodied robots and humans in VR lead to improved collaboration performance and increased user satisfaction, compared to non-embodied conditions. We discuss implications for HRC system design and future research directions.
