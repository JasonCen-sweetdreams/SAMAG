Unsupervised anomaly detection is a crucial task in various applications, but existing methods often struggle with high-dimensional data and limited computational resources. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical contrastive learning approach, 'HCLAD', which leverages a multi-scale representation learning framework to identify anomalies in an efficient and effective manner. By incorporating a hierarchical clustering module and a contrastive loss function, HCLAD learns to encode robust and discriminative features that distinguish anomalies from normal patterns. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HCLAD over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
