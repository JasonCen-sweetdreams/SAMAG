Autonomous robot swarms have demonstrated great potential in various applications, such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and warehouse management. However, efficient task allocation remains a significant challenge, especially in decentralized settings. This paper proposes a novel swarm intelligence-based negotiation protocol for decentralized task allocation in autonomous robot swarms. Our approach leverages the concept of stigmergy to enable robots to negotiate tasks through indirect communication. We evaluate our protocol using simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved task allocation efficiency, flexibility, and scalability compared to traditional centralized approaches.
