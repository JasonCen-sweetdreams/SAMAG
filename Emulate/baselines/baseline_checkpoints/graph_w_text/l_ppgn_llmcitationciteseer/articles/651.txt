Temporal graph databases have become increasingly important for various applications, such as social media analysis and IoT sensor networks. However, existing indexing techniques struggle to efficiently handle the massive scale and dynamic nature of these databases. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'ChronoGraph', which combines a hierarchical clustering approach with an adaptive sampling strategy. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ChronoGraph achieves up to 3x faster query performance and 2x better storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods, while supporting efficient insertion and deletion operations.
