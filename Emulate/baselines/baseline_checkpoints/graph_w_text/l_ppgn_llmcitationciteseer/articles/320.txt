Modern database systems rely heavily on query optimization to achieve high performance. While traditional optimization techniques rely on manual indexing and query rewriting, recent advances in machine learning have introduced learned index structures as a promising alternative. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'LION', which integrates learned index structures with traditional optimization techniques. LION uses a neural network to predict the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and learned index statistics. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that LION outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
