This paper addresses the challenge of efficient pathfinding in large, complex environments by proposing a novel, hierarchical approach to graph decomposition for multi-agent systems. Our method, called Hierarchical Graph Partitioning (HGP), recursively divides the graph into smaller subgraphs, allowing agents to plan paths independently while minimizing conflicts. We demonstrate the scalability of HGP in simulations involving thousands of agents and show significant reductions in computation time and path length compared to existing methods. The proposed approach has applications in areas such as autonomous vehicles, disaster response, and smart cities.
