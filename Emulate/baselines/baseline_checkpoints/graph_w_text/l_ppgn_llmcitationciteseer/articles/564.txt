This paper presents an exploratory study on designing conversational interfaces that can recognize and respond to users' emotional states, with a focus on mental health support. We developed a novel affective computing framework that integrates natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and emotional intelligence. Our user-centered design approach involved co-creating the interface with mental health professionals and individuals with lived experience. Results from a pilot study indicate that our emotion-aware interface can lead to increased self-disclosure, empathy, and trust in online mental health support systems.
