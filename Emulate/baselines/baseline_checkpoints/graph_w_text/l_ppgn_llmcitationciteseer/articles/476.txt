Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks. However, their scalability is limited by the computational complexity of graph clustering. We propose a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm, 'HierGNN', which leverages a cascade of k-means clustering and graph coarsening to reduce the graph size. Our method achieves a significant speedup in GNN training while maintaining the clustering quality. We evaluate HierGNN on several large-scale graph datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving the efficiency of GNN-based graph classification and node embedding tasks.
