This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective assignment strategies. Our approach, called GNN-TA, represents the agent-task graph as a heterogeneous network and learns to optimize task assignments based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and system constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of GNN-TA through extensive simulations, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized allocation methods.
