Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper presents a novel graph-based indexing approach, dubbed 'Distributed Graph Index' (DGI), which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to optimize query execution plans. DGI constructs a compact, distributed index that captures the interaction patterns between query nodes, enabling efficient exploration of the query space. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database demonstrate that DGI outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques, reducing query latency by up to 30% and improving system throughput by up to 25%.
