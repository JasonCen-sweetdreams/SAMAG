In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages adaptive auction mechanisms to allocate tasks to agents in real-time. Our approach, called 'AuctionMA', uses a novel bidding strategy that incorporates agent capabilities, task requirements, and environmental uncertainty. We provide theoretical guarantees for the AuctionMA's convergence and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulations of search-and-rescue and surveillance scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art decentralized allocation methods.
