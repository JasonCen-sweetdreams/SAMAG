Search engine result pages (SERPs) are vulnerable to manipulation by malicious actors, leading to biased and misleading search results. This paper proposes deceivedRank, a novel adversarial ranking approach that detects and mitigates manipulation attacks on SERPs. We develop a game-theoretic framework that models the interactions between the search engine and adversarial entities, and design a ranking algorithm that incorporates uncertainty quantification and robustness metrics. Experimental evaluations on a large-scale search engine dataset demonstrate that deceivedRank improves the robustness of search results by up to 35% compared to state-of-the-art ranking algorithms.
