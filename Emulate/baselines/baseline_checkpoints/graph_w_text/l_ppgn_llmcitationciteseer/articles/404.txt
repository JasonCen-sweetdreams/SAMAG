In multi-agent systems, efficient exploration of the environment is crucial for tasks such as search and rescue, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. This paper introduces a novel graph-based planning approach, dubbed 'Coordinated Explorer', which enables agents to coordinate their exploration efforts in a decentralized manner. By modeling the environment as a graph, agents can share information and plan their trajectories to minimize overlap and maximize coverage. We present simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of Coordinated Explorer in various scenarios, including urban search and rescue and environmental monitoring.
