Real-world image denoising remains a challenging task due to the complexity of noise patterns in camera-captured images. This paper introduces a novel noise-robust deep learning framework, 'NoiseShield', which combines a noise estimation module with a denoising network. Our approach leverages a large-scale dataset of real-world noisy images and incorporates a noise-aware loss function that adaptively weighs the importance of noise estimation during training. Experimental results demonstrate that NoiseShield outperforms state-of-the-art denoising methods on various benchmark datasets and real-world images, achieving improved visual quality and robustness to diverse noise types.
