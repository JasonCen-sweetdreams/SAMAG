Skyline queries are crucial in decision-making applications, but their processing remains a challenge in distributed databases. This paper presents a novel approach, 'Distributed Skyline Processing' (DSP), which leverages a hierarchical clustering-based indexing technique to efficiently prune the search space. DSP exploits the parallelism of distributed systems by assigning clusters to nodes based on data locality and query-pattern analysis. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DSP outperforms existing methods by up to 3x in terms of response time and reduces network communication by 40%.
