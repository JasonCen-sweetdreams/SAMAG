In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving system-wide objectives. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework based on evolutionary game theory, which enables agents to adaptively learn and adjust their strategies in response to changing environmental conditions. Our approach leverages the concept of evolutionary stable strategies to ensure that agents converge to a stable and efficient allocation of tasks. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving system performance and robustness compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
