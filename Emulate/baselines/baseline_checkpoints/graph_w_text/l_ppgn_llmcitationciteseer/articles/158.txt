Effective disaster response requires coordinating multiple agents with diverse capabilities. We propose a hierarchical task network (HTN) framework for multi-agent systems, enabling robust and adaptive response to complex disasters. Our framework integrates planning, scheduling, and execution to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, resource availability, and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulations of wildfire response and flood rescue scenarios, showcasing improved response times, reduced resource waste, and enhanced overall resilience.
