In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects overall system performance. This paper presents a novel decentralized autonomous task allocation framework (DATAs) that efficiently allocates tasks to heterogeneous agents with varying capabilities. DATAs leverages a distributed constraint optimization approach, enabling agents to negotiate and resolve conflicts locally. We evaluate DATAs in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing centralized methods.
