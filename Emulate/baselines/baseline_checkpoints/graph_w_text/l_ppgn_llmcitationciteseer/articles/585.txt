This paper presents an empirical study on the design of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) for healthcare interactions, focusing on inclusivity for users with disabilities. We conducted participatory design workshops with healthcare providers, patients, and accessibility experts to co-create ECA prototypes that address the needs of diverse user groups. Our findings highlight the importance of personalized avatars, multimodal input/output, and culturally sensitive dialogue management. We propose a set of design guidelines for ECAs that promote equal access to healthcare information and services, and evaluate their effectiveness in a quantitative user study.
