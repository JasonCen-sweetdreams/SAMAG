Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to retrieve relevant documents due to the limitations of the initial query. This paper proposes a query-driven document expansion approach, which leverages the query context to identify and incorporate relevant terms from the top-retrieved documents. Our method, QEDE, iteratively refines the query representation by incorporating contextualized embeddings and feedback-based term weighting. Experimental results on the TREC-8 Ad-Hoc dataset demonstrate that QEDE significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.
