In multi-agent systems, effective communication is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, the complexity of agent interactions and the diversity of agent knowledge representations hinder the development of efficient communication protocols. This paper presents AOCC, an adaptive ontology-based communication framework that enables agents to dynamically align their knowledge representations and facilitate more effective coordination. AOCC leverages machine learning-based ontology alignment and probabilistic modeling to infer the most relevant information to share among agents. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that AOCC significantly improves the overall system performance and adaptability compared to traditional communication approaches.
