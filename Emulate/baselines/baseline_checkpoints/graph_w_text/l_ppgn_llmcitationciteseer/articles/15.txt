Time series forecasting is a crucial task in many domains, but traditional methods often fail to capture uncertainty and are sensitive to noisy data. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian neural network (BNN) framework, 'TS-BNN', which leverages uncertainty quantification to improve forecasting robustness. We develop a hierarchical prior structure that incorporates domain knowledge and adapts to changing data distributions. Experiments on real-world datasets show that TS-BNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and uncertainty estimation, demonstrating its potential for reliable decision-making in applications such as finance and energy management.
