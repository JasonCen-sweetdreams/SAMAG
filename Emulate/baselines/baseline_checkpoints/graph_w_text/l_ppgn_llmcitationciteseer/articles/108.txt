Query expansion is a crucial component in modern information retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the retrieval effectiveness. This paper presents a novel neural query expansion approach, dubbed CAQE, which incorporates contextual information from the query and documents to generate more effective expansion terms. Our model utilizes a graph attention mechanism to capture the relationships between query terms, documents, and their latent representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in ranking metrics such as NDCG and ERR.
