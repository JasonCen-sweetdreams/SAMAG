Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer user queries. Existing methods rely on lexical matching or dense retrieval, which suffer from high computational costs or suboptimal performance. We propose a novel hierarchical neural density estimation (HNDE) framework for passage retrieval, which models the distribution of relevant passages using a hierarchical latent variable model. Our method leverages both local and global contextual information to estimate the relevance of each passage, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the SQuAD-Open and TriviaQA datasets. We demonstrate the efficiency of HNDE by achieving a 3x speedup over existing neural retrieval methods while maintaining superior performance.
