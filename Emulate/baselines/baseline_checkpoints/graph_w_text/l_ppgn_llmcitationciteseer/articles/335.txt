This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for efficient traffic management in autonomous vehicles. We propose a novel algorithm, 'Traffic Harmony', which enables agents to learn from their local observations and interactions with neighboring agents to optimize traffic flow. Our approach integrates graph neural networks with deep Q-learning to learn complex traffic patterns and adapt to changing road conditions. Experimental results in a simulated environment demonstrate significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional traffic management systems.
