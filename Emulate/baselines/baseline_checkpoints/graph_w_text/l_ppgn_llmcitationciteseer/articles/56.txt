In complex, dynamic environments, multi-agent systems often struggle to efficiently allocate tasks and navigate through crowded spaces. This paper introduces a decentralized, hierarchical framework for task allocation and path finding, applicable to various domains such as robotics, traffic management, and smart cities. Our approach leverages a novel, two-layered architecture that combines a top-down task allocator with a bottom-up path planner, enabling agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and optimize their routes in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced navigation times compared to existing, centralized approaches.
