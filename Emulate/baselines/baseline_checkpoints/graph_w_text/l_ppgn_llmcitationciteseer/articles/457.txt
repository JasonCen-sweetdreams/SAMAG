In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem, especially when agents operate under dynamic resource constraints. This paper presents a novel decentralized algorithm, 'DynaTA', which enables agents to coordinate task allocation in real-time. DynaTA leverages a distributed constraint optimization framework to accommodate changing resource availability and agent capabilities. We evaluate DynaTA through extensive simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving overall system utility and reducing task allocation latency compared to existing methods.
