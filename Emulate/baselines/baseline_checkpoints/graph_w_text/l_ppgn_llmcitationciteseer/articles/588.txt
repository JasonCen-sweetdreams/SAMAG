Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR interfaces often pose accessibility barriers. This paper presents the results of a user-centered design study aimed at creating an accessible VR interface for this population. We developed a novel set of interaction techniques that accommodate cognitive and motor impairments, and evaluated their usability with a group of older adults with mild cognitive impairment. Our findings highlight the importance of simplifying menu systems, providing clear auditory feedback, and using intuitive gesture-based interactions. We also introduce a set of design guidelines for accessible VR interfaces that can be applied to a range of applications.
