Domain-specific retrieval tasks, such as patent search or biomedical literature retrieval, require tailored ranking models that can effectively capture domain knowledge. This paper proposes a neural ranking framework, 'DomainRank', which integrates domain-specific features and knowledge graphs into a deep learning architecture. We evaluate DomainRank on three specialized domains and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Further analysis reveals that the incorporation of domain knowledge enables the model to better distinguish between relevant and non-relevant documents.
