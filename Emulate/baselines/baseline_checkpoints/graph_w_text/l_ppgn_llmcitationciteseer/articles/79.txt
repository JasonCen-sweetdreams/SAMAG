Question answering over knowledge graphs (KGs) has gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing methods struggle to effectively model complex, multi-hop dependencies between entities and relations. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based framework, HAKE, which learns to recursively focus on relevant KG substructures when answering multi-hop questions. Our approach leverages a compositional representation of KG entities and relations, enabling the model to capture nuanced semantic relationships. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HAKE in improving question answering accuracy, particularly for complex, multi-hop queries.
