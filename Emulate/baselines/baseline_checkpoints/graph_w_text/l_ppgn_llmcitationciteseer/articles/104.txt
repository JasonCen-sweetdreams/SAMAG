This paper proposes a decentralized autonomous agent framework for real-time traffic management. Our approach leverages multi-agent systems and distributed optimization to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings and lane allocations. We introduce a novel negotiation protocol that enables agents to exchange information and coordinate actions in real-time, resulting in reduced congestion and travel times. Simulation results on a realistic urban traffic network demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating traffic congestion and improving overall network efficiency.
