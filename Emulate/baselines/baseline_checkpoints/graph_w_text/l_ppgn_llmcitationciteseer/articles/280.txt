In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is crucial for achieving common goals. However, in real-world scenarios, agents often possess incomplete information about each other's capabilities, preferences, or intentions. This paper proposes a decentralized coalition formation framework that addresses this challenge by integrating belief revision and probabilistic planning. Our approach enables agents to iteratively refine their beliefs about other agents and adapt their coalition strategies accordingly. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in terms of coalition stability and overall system performance.
