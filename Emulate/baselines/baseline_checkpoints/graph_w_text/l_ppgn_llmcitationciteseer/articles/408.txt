Few-shot node classification on graph-structured data is a challenging task due to the scarcity of labeled nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global graph structures to adapt to new classes. HGAT consists of a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant nodes and edges at multiple scales, and a meta-learning framework that fine-tunes the model on a few labeled nodes. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, achieving up to 15% improvement in accuracy.
