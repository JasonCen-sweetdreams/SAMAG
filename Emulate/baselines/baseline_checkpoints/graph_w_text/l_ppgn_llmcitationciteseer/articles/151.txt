Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their adoption among older adults is hindered by accessibility barriers. This study investigates the design of inclusive voice assistants for older adults, focusing on multimodal interaction. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, exploring their preferences and experiences with voice, gesture, and visual modalities. Our findings highlight the importance of personalized feedback, simplified language, and adaptive error handling. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating accessible voice assistants that cater to the diverse needs of older adults, promoting digital inclusion and independent living.
