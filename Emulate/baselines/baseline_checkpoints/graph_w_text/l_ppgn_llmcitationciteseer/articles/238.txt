Query expansion is a crucial component in Information Retrieval (IR) systems, as it enables users to retrieve relevant documents that may not contain the exact query terms. Traditional query expansion methods rely on term co-occurrence statistics or word embeddings, which may not capture complex relationships between entities. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphEntityExpand', which leverages hierarchical graph-based embeddings to model entities in a query. We demonstrate that GraphEntityExpand outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods on several benchmark datasets, particularly for entity-centric queries.
