Autonomous systems operating in real-world environments often face dynamic concept drift, where the underlying data distribution changes over time. This paper proposes an incremental learning framework, 'DriftAdapt', that adapts to concept drift in autonomous systems. DriftAdapt combines online learning with a novel drift detection method based on statistical process control. We evaluate DriftAdapt on a real-world autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate its ability to adapt to sudden changes in the environment, outperforming traditional batch learning approaches. Our framework has significant implications for ensuring the reliability and safety of autonomous systems in dynamic environments.
