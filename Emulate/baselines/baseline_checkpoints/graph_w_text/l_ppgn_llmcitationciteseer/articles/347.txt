The proliferation of IoT devices has led to a surge in resource allocation challenges. This paper presents a novel decentralized agent-based framework for efficient resource allocation in IoT networks. Our approach leverages multi-agent systems to enable autonomous decision-making at the edge, reducing latency and improving scalability. We introduce a distributed negotiation protocol that enables agents to dynamically allocate resources based on real-time demand and availability. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization and network efficiency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
