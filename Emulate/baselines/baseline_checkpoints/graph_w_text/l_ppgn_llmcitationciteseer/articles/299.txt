Effective task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and resources need to collaborate to achieve common goals. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a decentralized, multi-agent Q-network (MAQN) that learns to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. MAQN leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent interactions and task dependencies, enabling efficient and adaptive task assignment. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to traditional, centralized allocation methods.
