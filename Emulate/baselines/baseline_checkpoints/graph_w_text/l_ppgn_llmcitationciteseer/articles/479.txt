As autonomous vehicles (AVs) increasingly share roads with human-driven vehicles, efficient pathfinding with real-time traffic prediction becomes crucial. This paper presents a novel multi-agent pathfinding framework, 'TrafficAware', which leverages real-time traffic data and predicts traffic patterns to optimize AV routes. We propose a decentralized approach where AVs, modeled as agents, communicate with each other and the infrastructure to dynamically adjust their paths. Our experiments demonstrate that TrafficAware reduces travel time by up to 25% and decreases the number of conflicts at intersections by 30% compared to traditional graph-based pathfinding methods.
