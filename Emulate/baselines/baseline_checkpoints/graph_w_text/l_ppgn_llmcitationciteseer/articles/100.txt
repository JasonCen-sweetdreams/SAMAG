Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex network data. However, optimizing queries in real-time remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces 'GraphAdapt', a novel indexing framework that dynamically adapts to changing query patterns and graph structures. GraphAdapt employs a hybrid indexing approach, combining vertex-centric and edge-centric indexing techniques. Our experiments on large-scale graph datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements, with query execution times reduced by up to 75% compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods.
