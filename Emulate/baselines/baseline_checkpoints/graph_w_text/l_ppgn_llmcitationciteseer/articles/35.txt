Conversational agents have the potential to improve the daily lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but their design often neglects the unique needs of this population. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing accessible conversational agents, focusing on simplicity, clarity, and error tolerance. We conducted a series of usability studies with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying key design recommendations for agent dialogue, visual feedback, and error handling. Our findings inform the development of more accessible and effective conversational agents, enabling older adults to engage in meaningful interactions and maintain their independence.
