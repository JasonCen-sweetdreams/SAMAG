Gesture recognition systems have shown great potential in enhancing human-computer interaction. However, existing systems often neglect the needs of users with motor impairments, leading to reduced accuracy and accessibility. This paper presents a novel framework for designing gesture recognition systems that cater to users with motor impairments. We propose a machine learning approach that leverages a large gesture dataset collected from users with varying levels of motor impairment. Our system incorporates a personalized gesture adaptation module that adjusts to individual users' abilities, resulting in improved recognition accuracy and reduced error rates. We evaluated our system with 30 participants and observed significant improvements in usability and user satisfaction.
