Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges when interacting with computers. Eye-tracking technology offers a promising solution, but existing gaze-driven interfaces often suffer from low typing speeds and high error rates. This paper presents EyeGazeType, a novel interface that leverages machine learning-based gaze prediction and adaptive dwell-time algorithms to enable efficient typing. Our user study with 20 participants with motor impairments shows that EyeGazeType achieves an average typing speed of 15.2 words per minute with an accuracy of 92.5%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art gaze-driven interfaces.
