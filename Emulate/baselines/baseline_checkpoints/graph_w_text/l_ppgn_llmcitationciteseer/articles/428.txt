This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed a VR system that tracks users' hand movements and maps them to virtual objects, creating an immersive experience. Our user study reveals that gesture-based interaction enhances spatial awareness, memory recall, and cognitive load reduction compared to traditional controller-based input. We also find that users' gestures exhibit distinctive patterns that can be used to predict their cognitive states. Our findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and effective VR interfaces that leverage embodied cognition principles.
