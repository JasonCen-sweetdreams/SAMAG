Multi-tenancy is a crucial feature in modern cloud-based database systems, allowing multiple users to share the same physical infrastructure. However, optimizing query performance in such systems is challenging due to the varying workload patterns and resource constraints of each tenant. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'TenantAware', which takes into account the dynamic tenant behavior and resource utilization to optimize query plans. Our experiments on a popular cloud-based database platform show that TenantAware outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource efficiency.
