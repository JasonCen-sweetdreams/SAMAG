Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complexity and nuance of patent documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, which learns to identify relevant expansion terms from a large corpus of patent texts. Our model, called PatentNet, incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global context in patent documents. Experimental results on a standard patent retrieval dataset show that PatentNet outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
