Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide transparent and trustworthy recommendations. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for ERS, which captures user preferences at multiple levels of abstraction. Our HAN model consists of a hierarchical encoder that learns to represent users and items as dense vectors, and a attention-based decoder that generates personalized explanations for recommended items. We evaluate our approach on a real-world e-commerce dataset and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
