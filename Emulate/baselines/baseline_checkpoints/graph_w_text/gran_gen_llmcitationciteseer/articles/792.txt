Modern search engines face the challenge of efficiently ranking documents from vast indexes. This paper presents a novel hybrid retrieval model, 'HRM', which combines the strengths of sparse and dense representations. HRM leverages a sparse term-frequency-based approach for initial retrieval and then refines the ranking using a dense neural network-based re-ranker. We propose a two-stage training strategy, where the sparse model is trained using a listwise loss function, and the dense model is fine-tuned using a pairwise loss function. Experimental results on the TREC Deep Learning Track dataset demonstrate that HRM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
