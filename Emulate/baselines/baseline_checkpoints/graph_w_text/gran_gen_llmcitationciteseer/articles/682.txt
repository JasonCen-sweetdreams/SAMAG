Cloud-native relational databases have revolutionized data management, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel adaptive indexing approach, 'Aurora', which leverages machine learning to dynamically optimize index structures based on workload patterns. Aurora integrates a lightweight, online index advisor with a hierarchical indexing framework, enabling real-time adaptation to changing query distributions. Our experimental evaluation on a cloud-based database instance shows that Aurora achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional, statically configured indexing schemes.
