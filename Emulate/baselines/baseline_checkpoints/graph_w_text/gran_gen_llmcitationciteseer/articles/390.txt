With the increasing adoption of cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms, optimizing query performance for multiple tenants has become a pressing concern. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MultiTenOpt', which leverages machine learning-based query plan prediction and adaptive resource allocation to minimize query latency and resource contention. We develop a probabilistic model to estimate query execution times and resource utilization, and propose a dynamic scheduling algorithm to allocate resources efficiently. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate that MultiTenOpt reduces average query latency by up to 30% and improves resource utilization by 25% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
