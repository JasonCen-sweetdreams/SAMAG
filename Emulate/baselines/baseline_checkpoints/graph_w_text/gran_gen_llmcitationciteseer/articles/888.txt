Distributed multi-agent systems require robust consensus protocols to ensure reliable decision-making in the presence of faulty or malicious agents. This paper proposes a novel decentralized consensus protocol, 'Byzantine-Resilient Consensus' (BRC), which achieves Byzantine fault tolerance without relying on a centralized authority. BRC employs a combination of digital signatures, threshold cryptography, and a probabilistic voting mechanism to detect and correct malicious behavior. We demonstrate the protocol's effectiveness through simulations on a large-scale agent network, showcasing its ability to maintain consensus even when up to 30% of agents are Byzantine faulty.
