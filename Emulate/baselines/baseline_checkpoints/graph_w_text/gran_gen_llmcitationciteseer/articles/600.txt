Traditional authentication methods, such as passwords and biometrics, are vulnerable to various attacks. This paper proposes EyeGazeAuth, a novel authentication system that leverages machine learning to analyze eye movement patterns. We collect eye-tracking data from 100 participants and train a convolutional neural network to distinguish between genuine and impostor users. Our approach achieves an accuracy of 97.5% and outperforms existing authentication methods in resisting shoulder-surfing and replay attacks. We also conduct a user study to evaluate the usability and perceived security of EyeGazeAuth, demonstrating its potential for high-security applications.
