Traffic signal control is a complex problem that requires coordinating multiple agents to optimize traffic flow. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, 'TrafficCoor', which enables agents to learn coordinated policies for traffic signal control. We introduce a graph-based attention mechanism that allows agents to share information and adapt to dynamic traffic conditions. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulation platform demonstrate that TrafficCoor outperforms traditional traffic signal control methods, reducing congestion and travel times by up to 20%.
