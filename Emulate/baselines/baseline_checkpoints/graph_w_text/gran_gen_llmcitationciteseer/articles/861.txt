The increasing adoption of NoSQL databases in big data analytics has led to a growing need for efficient query processing. This paper presents a novel GPU-accelerated indexing approach for column-oriented NoSQL databases, dubbed 'GPU-ColIx'. By leveraging the massively parallel architecture of modern GPUs, GPU-ColIx achieves significant performance gains for range queries and aggregations. We propose a dynamic indexing strategy that adapts to query patterns and data distributions, minimizing indexing overhead and optimizing query execution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GPU-ColIx outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 5x for certain query types.
