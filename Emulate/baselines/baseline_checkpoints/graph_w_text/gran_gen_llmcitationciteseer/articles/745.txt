Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide transparency and accountability in decision-making processes. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model, which incorporates both item and user-level attention mechanisms to generate personalized explanations for recommendations. We leverage graph neural networks to model complex relationships between users, items, and features, and introduce a hierarchical attention framework to selectively focus on relevant information. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS models in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
