Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but designing effective user interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience in VR. We propose a novel framework, 'AvatarGen', which generates customized avatars based on user preferences and behavior. Our user study involving 50 participants shows that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, reduced cognitive load, and improved overall satisfaction. We also identify key factors influencing avatar design and provide guidelines for VR developers.
