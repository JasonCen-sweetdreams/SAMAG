This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework using adaptive multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach, called Adaptive Task Allocation via Reinforcement Learning (ATAR), enables agents to learn from experience and adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. We introduce a decentralized, asynchronous learning algorithm that allows agents to share knowledge and coordinate actions in real-time. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that ATAR outperforms traditional task allocation methods in terms of task completion time, resource utilization, and adaptability to unexpected events.
