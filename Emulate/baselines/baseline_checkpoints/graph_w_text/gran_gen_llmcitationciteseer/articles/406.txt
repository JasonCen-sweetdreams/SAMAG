Anomaly detection in Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of industrial processes. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for real-time anomaly detection in IIoT systems. Our approach leverages a hierarchical DRL architecture that integrates a deep autoencoder for feature learning and a reinforcement learning module for adaptive thresholding. We evaluate our method on a real-world IIoT dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting anomalies in real-time, outperforming traditional machine learning and rule-based approaches.
