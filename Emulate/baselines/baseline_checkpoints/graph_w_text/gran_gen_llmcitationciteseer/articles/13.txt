Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc information retrieval, but existing methods often rely on hand-crafted rules or simplistic models. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion. Our method, called QERL, learns to select the most informative expansion terms by interacting with a simulated environment that mimics the retrieval process. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that QERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and recall, while reducing the number of redundant expansion terms.
