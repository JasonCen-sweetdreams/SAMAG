Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus and extracting the answer. Existing passage retrieval methods rely on lexical matching or dense neural networks, which can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) architecture that models the relationships between passages, sentences, and entities. Our approach leverages graph-based attention mechanisms to identify the most relevant passages and reduce the search space. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset show that our method achieves state-of-the-art passage retrieval performance with significant computational savings.
