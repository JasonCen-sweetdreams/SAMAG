The proliferation of IoT devices and social media platforms has led to an exponential increase in data volumes, making real-time data warehousing a crucial aspect of modern data analytics. Traditional query optimization techniques often fail to provide optimal performance under such massive data influx. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using learned index structures, which can adapt to the underlying data distribution and workload patterns. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach, called 'LISA', achieves an average speedup of 3.5x over state-of-the-art query optimization techniques, while reducing memory footprint by 40%.
