Distributed database systems (DDS) face significant challenges in optimizing query performance, particularly in the presence of dynamic workloads and varying data distributions. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing framework, 'AdaptIx', which dynamically adjusts index structures based on real-time query patterns and system resource utilization. Our approach leverages machine learning-driven cost models to predict optimal indexing configurations, resulting in improved query latency and reduced resource consumption. Experimental evaluations on a large-scale DDS testbed demonstrate AdaptIx's effectiveness in achieving up to 3x query performance improvements over traditional static indexing approaches.
