Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their accessibility for users with disabilities remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop multimodal interfaces for voice assistants that cater to diverse abilities. We conducted co-design workshops with users with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive disabilities to identify key interaction challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the design of an inclusive voice assistant prototype that incorporates text-based input, gesture recognition, and personalized accessibility features. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates compared to existing voice assistants.
