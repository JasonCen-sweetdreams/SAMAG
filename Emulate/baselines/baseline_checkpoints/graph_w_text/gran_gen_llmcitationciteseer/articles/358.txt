Coordinating multiple agents in complex environments is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to tackle this challenge. We introduce a novel framework that combines a high-level policy for task allocation with low-level policies for individual agent control. The high-level policy is learned using a graph neural network, while the low-level policies are learned using deep reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach in a simulated rescue scenario, demonstrating improved coordination and response times compared to traditional decentralized approaches.
