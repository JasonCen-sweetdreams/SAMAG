Traditional information retrieval systems rely on exact keyword matching, which often fails to capture the nuanced relationships between query terms. We propose a novel neural approach, Hierarchical Query Graphs (HQRG), which represents queries as hierarchical graphs and documents as dense vectors. By leveraging these graph-structured queries, our model can effectively capture entity relationships, synonyms, and contextual dependencies. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQRG outperforms state-of-the-art neural IR models, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
