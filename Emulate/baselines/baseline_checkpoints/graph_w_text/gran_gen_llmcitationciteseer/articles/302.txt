Entity disambiguation in knowledge graphs is a challenging task due to the exponential growth of entities and their relationships. This paper proposes a novel deep hierarchical neural network, 'HDNet', that leverages the hierarchical structure of knowledge graphs to disambiguate entities. HDNet employs a multi-level attention mechanism to capture both local and global contextual information, outperforming state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that HDNet achieves a 12.5% improvement in F1-score on the YAGO dataset and a 9.2% improvement on the DBpedia dataset.
