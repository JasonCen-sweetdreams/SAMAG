Virtual reality (VR) technology has made significant strides in recent years, but understanding the factors that influence user experience and presence remains an open challenge. This paper investigates the role of embodiment and agency in VR, exploring how users' sense of body ownership and control affect their feeling of immersion and engagement. We conducted a user study with 40 participants, utilizing a custom-built VR environment with varying levels of embodiment and agency. Our results show that users who experienced higher levels of embodiment and agency reported increased presence and enjoyment, and were more likely to exhibit exploratory behavior. These findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to enhance user experience and immersion.
