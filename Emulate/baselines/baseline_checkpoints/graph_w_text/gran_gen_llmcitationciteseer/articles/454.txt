Autonomous vehicles require sophisticated control systems to navigate complex scenarios. This paper presents a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning (DHRL) framework for autonomous vehicle control. Our approach combines a high-level policy network with a low-level control network, enabling the vehicle to adapt to diverse driving situations. We introduce a hierarchical exploration strategy that balances short-term and long-term rewards, leading to improved learning efficiency and stability. Experimental results on a realistic simulation platform demonstrate that our DHRL approach outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods in terms of safety, efficiency, and adaptability.
