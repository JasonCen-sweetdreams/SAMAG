Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it enhances the retrieval performance by incorporating relevant terms. This paper proposes a novel context-aware embedding-based approach, 'CAQE', which captures the semantic relationships between query terms and the context in which they appear. CAQE leverages a graph-based neural network to model the query context and generates expanded queries that better reflect the user's intent. Experimental results on several standard benchmarks show that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
