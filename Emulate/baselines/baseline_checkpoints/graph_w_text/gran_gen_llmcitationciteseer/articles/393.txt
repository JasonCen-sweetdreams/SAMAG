This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation for autonomous agents in decentralized environments. We formulate the task allocation problem as a distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) problem and propose a decentralized algorithm, called DACO, that allows agents to negotiate and allocate tasks without a central authority. DACO leverages a combination of constraint propagation and message-passing to efficiently allocate tasks while respecting agent capabilities and constraints. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DACO outperforms existing decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion rate and agent utility.
