Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly improve the retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based query expansion approach, which leverages a transformer-based architecture to learn the contextual relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our approach, called DeepQE, integrates a sentence encoder and a graph-based attention mechanism to identify salient terms and phrases that can effectively expand the query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of precision and recall.
