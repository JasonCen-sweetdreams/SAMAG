Entity disambiguation is a critical task in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches are often computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. This paper proposes a novel indexing method, 'EDIndex', which leverages a combination of graph-based and semantic-based features to efficiently disambiguate entities in large-scale knowledge graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EDIndex on several benchmark datasets, achieving a 3x speedup over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high disambiguation accuracy. Our approach enables real-time entity disambiguation in applications such as question answering and text analysis.
