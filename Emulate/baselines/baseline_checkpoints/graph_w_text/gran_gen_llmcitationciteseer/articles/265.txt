Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of dynamically allocating resources to meet fluctuating workload demands. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'CloudOptimizer', that learns to adaptively allocate resources to minimize costs, reduce latency, and improve quality of service. Our approach leverages a novel combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep Q-networks (DQN) to learn a policy that optimizes resource allocation in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results on a real-world cloud dataset demonstrate that CloudOptimizer outperforms traditional rule-based approaches and achieves significant cost savings and performance improvements.
