Column-oriented databases have gained popularity in recent years due to their improved storage efficiency and query performance. However, optimizing queries for these databases remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning techniques to predict the most efficient query plan. Our approach, called 'ColOpt', utilizes a combination of feature extraction and reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workload patterns and database schema. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColOpt outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query execution time.
