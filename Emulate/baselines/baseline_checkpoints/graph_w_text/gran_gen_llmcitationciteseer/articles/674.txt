In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is crucial for achieving common goals. However, in real-world scenarios, agents often have incomplete information about each other's capabilities and preferences. This paper presents a novel distributed coalition formation algorithm, 'DCFA', which leverages probabilistic graphical models to reason about uncertain agent relationships. DCFA incorporates a decentralized negotiation protocol that enables agents to iteratively refine their coalition structures based on received information. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DCFA outperforms existing methods in terms of coalition stability and overall system utility.
