As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding human-robot collaboration in these environments is crucial. This study explores the effect of embodiment on human trust, communication, and task performance in VR-based human-robot collaboration. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR platform and a robotic arm. Our results show that embodied robots, which mimic human-like movements, lead to higher trust and better task performance compared to non-embodied robots. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the level of embodiment significantly influences the type and frequency of communication between humans and robots.
