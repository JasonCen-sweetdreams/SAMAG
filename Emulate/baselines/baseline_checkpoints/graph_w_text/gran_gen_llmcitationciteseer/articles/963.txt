Passage retrieval is a fundamental task in many information retrieval (IR) systems. However, the effectiveness of passage retrieval models is often limited by the brevity and ambiguity of user queries. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, 'QDE', which selectively expands relevant documents with contextual information to better match user queries. We design a neural ranking model that incorporates query-dependent document representations and demonstrate significant improvements in passage retrieval performance on several benchmark datasets. QDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, and has potential applications in various IR systems, including search engines and question answering platforms.
