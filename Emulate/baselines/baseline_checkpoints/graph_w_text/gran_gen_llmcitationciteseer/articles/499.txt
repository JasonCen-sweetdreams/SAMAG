Virtual reality (VR) systems have seen rapid advancements in recent years, but the impact of personalized haptic feedback on user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of a novel haptic feedback framework that incorporates user preferences, task requirements, and environmental factors. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, analyzing the effects of personalized haptic feedback on user engagement, task performance, and perceived realism. Results show that our framework significantly enhances user experience, with participants reporting higher levels of immersion and satisfaction compared to traditional, one-size-fits-all haptic feedback approaches.
