Ad-hoc retrieval faces the challenge of effectively capturing query intent, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding approach, 'GraphQE', which leverages the semantic relationships between query terms to generate informative expansions. By representing queries as graphs and applying a hierarchical attention mechanism, GraphQE identifies salient concepts and relationships, resulting in more accurate and diverse expansions. Experimental results on the TREC-8 Ad-Hoc Retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
