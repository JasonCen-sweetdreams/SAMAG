Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where multiple agents with varying capabilities need to be assigned to tasks to optimize system performance. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework using deep reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'DRL-TA', enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing task requirements and agent capabilities. We evaluate DRL-TA on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized and distributed allocation strategies.
