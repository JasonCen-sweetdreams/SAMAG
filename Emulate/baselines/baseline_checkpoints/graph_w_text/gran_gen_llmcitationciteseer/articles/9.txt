Ad-hoc retrieval typically relies on query expansion techniques to improve retrieval effectiveness. However, traditional methods often rely on simplistic weighting schemes and neglect the semantic relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'NeuroExpander', which leverages deep neural networks to learn context-aware term representations. By incorporating these representations into a probabilistic retrieval model, NeuroExpander achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach to varying query lengths and domains.
