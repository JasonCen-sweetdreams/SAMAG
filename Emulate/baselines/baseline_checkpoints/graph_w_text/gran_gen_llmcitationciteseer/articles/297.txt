Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants, focusing on the accessibility and usability challenges faced by older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, identifying key pain points and areas for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant prototype, 'ElderVoice', which incorporates features such as natural language processing for cognitive support, personalized feedback, and multimodal output. A usability evaluation with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
