This paper addresses the problem of distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and constraints need to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel stochastic search algorithm, called 'AgentSearch', which leverages probabilistic modeling to efficiently explore the vast space of possible task allocations. Our approach incorporates a probabilistic graphical model to capture task dependencies and agent capabilities, enabling the identification of high-quality solutions. Experimental results on a suite of benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentSearch in achieving near-optimal task allocations, outperforming existing methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
