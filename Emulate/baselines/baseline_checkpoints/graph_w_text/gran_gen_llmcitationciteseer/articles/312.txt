In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is critical for achieving cooperative goals. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network (GNN) based approach for coordinated task allocation. Our method, called 'GNN-TA', represents the agent-task relationships as a graph and learns to predict the optimal task assignments through a graph-based attention mechanism. We evaluate GNN-TA on a simulated search and rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach is scalable, flexible, and can be applied to a wide range of multi-agent domains.
