Task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities need to be assigned to tasks to maximize overall efficiency. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn distributed task allocation policies. We model the agent-task interaction as a graph and employ a GNN to learn the node representations, which are then used to predict the task assignments. Our approach is fully decentralized, scalable, and robust to changes in the agent or task sets. Experimental results on a variety of scenarios demonstrate significant improvements over traditional optimization-based methods, particularly in dynamic environments.
