This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and constraints need to be assigned tasks to maximize overall system performance. We formulate the task allocation problem as a Markov decision process and propose a reinforcement learning approach to learn the optimal allocation policy. Our approach utilizes a novel attention mechanism to model the complex interactions between agents and tasks, and is shown to outperform traditional optimization-based methods in simulation experiments involving robotic search and rescue scenarios.
