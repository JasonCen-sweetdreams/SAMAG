Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) aim to provide personalized learning experiences, but often struggle to adapt to individual students' needs. This paper proposes an eye-tracking-based approach to dynamically adjust the difficulty of instructional materials in real-time. Our system, 'EyeTutor', utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze pupil dilation, fixation duration, and saccade patterns to infer a student's cognitive load and knowledge gaps. We evaluate EyeTutor in a controlled study with 120 students, demonstrating significant improvements in learning outcomes and user engagement compared to traditional, rule-based ITS.
