Distributed databases are increasingly used to store and query large amounts of multi-dimensional data. However, existing indexing techniques struggle to efficiently support range queries in these systems. This paper presents 'DIMS', a novel distributed indexing scheme that leverages a combination of hash-based and tree-based indexing to accelerate multi-dimensional range queries. DIMS employs a hierarchical indexing structure that adaptively partitions the data space and dynamically adjusts the indexing granularity based on query workload. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that DIMS outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of storage efficiency.
