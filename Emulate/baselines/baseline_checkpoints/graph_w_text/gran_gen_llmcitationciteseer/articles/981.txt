Older adults with motor impairments face significant barriers when interacting with modern computing systems. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interface designed to improve accessibility for this demographic. We conducted a participatory design process with 15 older adults, resulting in a set of intuitive gestures that accommodate motor limitations. Our interface, 'EasyReach', utilizes machine learning-based gesture recognition and provides real-time feedback to assist users. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional mouse-based interactions.
