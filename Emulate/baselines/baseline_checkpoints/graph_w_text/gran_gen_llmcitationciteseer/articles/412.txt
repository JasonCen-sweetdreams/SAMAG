Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and energy. While graph neural networks have shown promise in this area, they often struggle to capture long-term dependencies and hierarchical relationships in the data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HiGAT) that leverages a multi-scale graph representation to model complex temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting tasks.
