Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages the power of neural dense retrieval models. NeuroQE generates a set of relevant expansion terms by analyzing the dense vector representations of the query and the top-retrieved documents. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE consistently outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness.
