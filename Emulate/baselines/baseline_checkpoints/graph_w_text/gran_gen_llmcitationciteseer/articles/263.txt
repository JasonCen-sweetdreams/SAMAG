Virtual reality (VR) has shown great potential in enhancing learning experiences, but cognitive load remains a significant bottleneck. This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in VR to reduce cognitive load. We designed a gesture-based interaction system, 'EmbodimentVR', which leverages users' bodily experiences to facilitate intuitive information processing. In a user study, we found that EmbodimentVR significantly reduced cognitive load and improved learning outcomes compared to traditional controller-based interactions. Our results suggest that embodied cognition can be an effective design principle for VR-based learning systems.
