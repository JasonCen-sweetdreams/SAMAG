The increasing adoption of RDF data has led to a growing need for scalable and efficient query processing techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel RDF graph partitioning approach, termed 'RDFPart', which leverages graph structural properties to distribute query workload across a cluster of machines. RDFPart incorporates a cost-based partitioning strategy that minimizes data replication, reduces network communication, and optimizes query execution times. Our experimental evaluation on real-world RDF datasets demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing graph partitioning methods, making RDFPart a promising solution for large-scale RDF data processing.
