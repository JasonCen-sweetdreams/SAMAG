Entity retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant entities from a large knowledge graph given a query. However, the query representation often lacks context, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'KG-Expan', which leverages knowledge graph embeddings to enrich the query representation. We develop a graph-based attention mechanism to select the most informative entities and expand the query with their related concepts. Experiments on the Wikidata and YAGO datasets demonstrate that KG-Expan significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
