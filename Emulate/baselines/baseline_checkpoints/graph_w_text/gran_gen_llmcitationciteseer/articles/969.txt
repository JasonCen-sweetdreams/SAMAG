Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph data and the need to minimize communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the graph topology, query patterns, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
