Query expansion techniques are crucial for enhancing the retrieval effectiveness of search engines. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding approach, 'GraphExpan', which leverages the structural relationships between query terms to generate more informative and diverse expansions. We represent the query context as a graph and learn node embeddings that capture semantic similarities between terms. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that GraphExpan outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods, leading to significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
