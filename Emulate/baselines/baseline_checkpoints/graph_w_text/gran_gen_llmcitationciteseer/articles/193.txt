Pathfinding is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, but existing algorithms struggle with large-scale graphs. This paper presents a novel approach, 'HiMAP', which leverages hierarchical graph decomposition to reduce the search space. By recursively applying a clustering-based decomposition scheme, HiMAP efficiently identifies and resolves conflicts between agents in a distributed manner. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HiMAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of scalability, solution quality, and runtime, making it suitable for real-time applications in domains like autonomous vehicles and robotics.
