This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction system for virtual reality (VR) applications, leveraging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to predict user intentions. Our approach, dubbed 'GazeRL', uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process raw gaze data and a DRL agent to learn a policy for selecting interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GazeRL in a VR game environment, achieving a 32% reduction in interaction time and a 25% increase in user satisfaction compared to traditional gaze-based methods. The proposed system has far-reaching implications for VR applications in gaming, education, and healthcare.
