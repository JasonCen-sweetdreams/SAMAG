Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, where the goal is to reformulate the user's query to better capture their information need. This paper introduces a novel latent semantic analysis (LSA) approach for query expansion, which leverages word embeddings and semantic role labeling to identify context-dependent relationships between query terms. We propose a generative model that learns to predict plausible expansion terms based on the query context, and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.
