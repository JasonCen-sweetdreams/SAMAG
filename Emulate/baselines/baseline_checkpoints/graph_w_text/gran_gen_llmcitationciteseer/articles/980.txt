Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with visually impaired individuals to identify key accessibility barriers and developed a set of guidelines for VR interface design. Our framework incorporates audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized assistance to facilitate user engagement. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the overall VR experience for users with visual impairments.
