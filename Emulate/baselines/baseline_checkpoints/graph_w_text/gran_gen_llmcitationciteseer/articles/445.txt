Autonomous vehicles require efficient and adaptive control systems to navigate complex environments. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn vehicle control policies. Our approach, 'GNN-RL', represents the vehicle's surroundings as a graph, enabling the incorporation of structural information and efficient learning of control policies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-RL in simulations of urban and highway driving scenarios, achieving improved performance and reduced computational overhead compared to traditional RL methods.
