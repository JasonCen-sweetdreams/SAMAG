Optimizing resource allocation in cloud computing is crucial for efficient service delivery. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, 'CloudAllocator', which learns to dynamically allocate resources in real-time. CloudAllocator leverages a multi-agent framework, where each agent represents a cloud resource, and utilizes a graph neural network (GNN) to capture complex dependencies between resources. Experimental results on a real-world cloud dataset demonstrate that CloudAllocator outperforms traditional rule-based allocation methods, achieving up to 30% improvement in resource utilization and 25% reduction in response time.
