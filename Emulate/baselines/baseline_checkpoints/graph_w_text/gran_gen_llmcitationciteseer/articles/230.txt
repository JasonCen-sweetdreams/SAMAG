Query optimization is a critical component of relational database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and resource utilization. With the increasing popularity of distributed databases, the complexity of query optimization has grown significantly. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We design a DRL agent that learns to optimize queries by interacting with a distributed database environment, leveraging techniques from graph theory and probabilistic modeling. Experimental results on a realistic distributed database benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
