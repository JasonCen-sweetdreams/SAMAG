In this paper, we propose a novel distributed task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using evolutionary game theory. Our approach, called EvoAllocate, models the task allocation problem as a repeated game among self-interested agents, where each agent aims to maximize its utility by selecting the most profitable tasks. We introduce a decentralized evolution strategy that allows agents to adapt their bidding strategies over time, leading to a Nash equilibrium. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that EvoAllocate outperforms existing algorithms in terms of system efficiency and fairness.
