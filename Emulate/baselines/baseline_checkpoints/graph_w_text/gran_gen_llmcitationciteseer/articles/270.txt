Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural document embeddings to improve retrieval performance. We introduce a real-time query expansion framework, 'NeuroXE', which uses a combination of semantic and syntactic features to generate high-quality expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that NeuroXE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
