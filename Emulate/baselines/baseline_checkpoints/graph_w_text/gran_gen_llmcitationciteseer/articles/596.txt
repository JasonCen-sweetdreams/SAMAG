Virtual reality (VR) avatars are increasingly used in social interactions, but their design often neglects the role of embodiment in conveying social cues. This paper presents a study investigating how varying levels of embodiment in VR avatars affect users' perception of social cues, such as gaze and proximity. We developed a novel VR platform that manipulates embodiment through customizable avatar representations and conducted a user study with 40 participants. Our results show that avatars with higher embodiment lead to more accurate social cue recognition, but also increase feelings of anxiety and self-consciousness. We discuss implications for VR avatar design and future research directions.
