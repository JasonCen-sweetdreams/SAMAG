Multi-modal neuroimaging datasets, combining structural and functional MRI with genetic data, offer a richer understanding of brain function and disease. However, existing analysis methods struggle to integrate these heterogeneous data types. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that models complex relationships between brain regions, genetic markers, and imaging features. HGAT leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant features and modalities, enabling the discovery of nuanced patterns and correlations. Our experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in predicting disease progression and identifying key biomarkers.
