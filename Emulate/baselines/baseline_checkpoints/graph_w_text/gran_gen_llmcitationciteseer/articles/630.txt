Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to achieve a common goal. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'RL-TA', that leverages reinforcement learning to learn optimal task assignment policies. Our approach utilizes a decentralized Markov decision process to model the task allocation problem, and trains agents to make decisions based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that RL-TA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion time and agent utility.
