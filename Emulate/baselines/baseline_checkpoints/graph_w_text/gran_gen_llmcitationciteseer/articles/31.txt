Online transaction fraud poses significant financial risks to businesses and individuals alike. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in fraud detection, but existing methods suffer from limitations in modeling complex transaction relationships. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, 'HAGNN', which leverages multi-scale graph representations to capture both local and global patterns in transaction graphs. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weighs node importance at different scales, enabling more accurate fraud detection. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and false positive rates.
