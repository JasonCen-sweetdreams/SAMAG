This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to efficiently allocate tasks among agents. Our approach, called GNN-TA, represents the agent-task interaction as a graph and employs a GNN to learn a distributed allocation policy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-TA in various scenarios, showing significant improvements in task completion time and agent utility compared to traditional centralized and decentralized approaches. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of GNN-TA to agent failures and communication disruptions.
