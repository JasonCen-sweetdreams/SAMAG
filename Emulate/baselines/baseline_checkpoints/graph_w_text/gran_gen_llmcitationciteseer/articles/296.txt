Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their effectiveness for older adults is hindered by age-related declines in speech recognition. This study investigates the impact of age on voice command recognition, analyzing data from 100 participants aged 65-85. We identify significant differences in speech patterns, such as slower speech rates and increased variability, which affect recognition accuracy. We propose an age-aware voice assistant framework that incorporates acoustic models tailored to older adults' speech characteristics, resulting in improved recognition rates of up to 25%. Our findings have implications for designing more inclusive and accessible voice-based interfaces for aging populations.
