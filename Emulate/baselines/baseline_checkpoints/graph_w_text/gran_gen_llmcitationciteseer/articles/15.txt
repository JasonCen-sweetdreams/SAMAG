The proliferation of IoT devices and real-time data streams poses significant challenges for traditional database indexing techniques. This paper introduces 'TS-Tree', a novel indexing framework for distributed databases that efficiently handles high-volume time-series data. Our approach leverages a combination of hierarchical indexing and chunk-based storage to minimize query latency and optimize storage utilization. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that TS-Tree outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time while maintaining comparable storage efficiency.
