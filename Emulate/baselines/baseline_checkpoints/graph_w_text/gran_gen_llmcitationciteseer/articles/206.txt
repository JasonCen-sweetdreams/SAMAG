Decentralized resource allocation in complex systems necessitates the coordination of multiple autonomous agents. This paper presents a novel decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, 'Distributed Q-Networks' (DQN), to optimize resource allocation in distributed systems. DQN leverages a decentralized Q-learning approach, where each agent learns to allocate resources based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DQN in a simulated cloud computing environment, showcasing improved resource utilization and reduced latency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
