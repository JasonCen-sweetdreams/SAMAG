This paper presents a novel gaze-aware interface system that leverages eye-tracking technology to improve user engagement and interaction with digital content. Our approach uses a machine learning-based gaze prediction model to anticipate user attention and dynamically adapt the interface layout, font sizes, and color schemes to optimize visual appeal and readability. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates a significant increase in user engagement, as measured by time spent on task and self-reported satisfaction, when compared to traditional interface designs. The proposed system has potential applications in various domains, including e-learning, advertising, and gaming.
