The increasing number of devices in IoT systems demands efficient resource allocation to ensure scalability and performance. This paper proposes an intelligent agent-based framework for resource allocation, which leverages decentralized decision-making and learning capabilities. Our approach, 'AgentIoT', enables agents to adapt to dynamic IoT environments, optimize resource utilization, and improve overall system efficiency. We evaluate AgentIoT through simulations on a real-world IoT dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in resource allocation and system performance compared to traditional centralized approaches.
