Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed databases, where the goal is to minimize query execution time and resource utilization. Traditional methods rely on heuristics and rule-based systems, which often fail to adapt to dynamic workloads. This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework, 'QueryOpt', that learns to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our approach leverages a novel combination of graph neural networks and Deep Q-Networks to model the query optimization problem. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that QueryOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 40% in query execution time and 25% in resource utilization.
