Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it can significantly impact the retrieval performance. Traditional methods rely on term co-occurrence and statistical analysis, but they often fail to capture the semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep learning-based semantic embeddings to model term relationships. We employ a neural network to learn dense vector representations of terms and their contexts, and then use these embeddings to expand the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
