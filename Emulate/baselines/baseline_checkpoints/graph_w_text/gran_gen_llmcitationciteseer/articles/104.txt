Knowledge graphs (KGs) suffer from scalability issues due to entity ambiguity and incomplete links. We propose a novel framework, 'GraphAmbiLink', which jointly tackles entity disambiguation and link prediction using graph attention networks (GATs). Our approach leverages KG-specific attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of neighboring entities and relationships, enabling more accurate disambiguation and link prediction. Experimental results on the YAGO3-10 and DBpedia datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 12% in entity disambiguation F1-score and 8% in link prediction AUC.
