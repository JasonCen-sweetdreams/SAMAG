In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn complex agent-agent and agent-task relationships. Our approach, called DAGAT, enables agents to adaptively allocate tasks based on their capabilities, resource constraints, and environmental dynamics. We evaluate DAGAT on a series of simulations, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized and distributed methods.
