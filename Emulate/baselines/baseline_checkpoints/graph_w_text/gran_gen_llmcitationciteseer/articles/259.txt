Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents for answer extraction. This paper introduces Hierarchical Dense Retrieval (HDR), a novel approach that leverages dense passage representations and hierarchical clustering to reduce the search space. HDR achieves a significant reduction in retrieval latency while maintaining or improving retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods. We evaluate HDR on several ODQA benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in retrieving relevant passages and improving end-to-end QA performance.
