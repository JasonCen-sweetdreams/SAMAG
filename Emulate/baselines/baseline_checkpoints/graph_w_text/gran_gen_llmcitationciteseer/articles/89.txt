Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn efficient query plans. We model the database schema and query workload as a graph and train a GNN to predict the optimal query plan. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time. We also explore the trade-offs between query optimization and data freshness in real-time analytics applications.
