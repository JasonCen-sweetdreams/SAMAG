Resource allocation is a crucial task in distributed systems, where agents must adapt to changing environmental conditions to optimize resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel context-aware agent-based framework, 'CAAR', which incorporates machine learning-based decision-making to allocate resources dynamically. CAAR agents learn from historical data and real-time sensor inputs to predict task demands, identify bottlenecks, and adjust resource allocations accordingly. Experimental results on a simulated distributed system demonstrate that CAAR achieves up to 30% improvement in resource utilization and 25% reduction in response time compared to traditional static allocation methods.
