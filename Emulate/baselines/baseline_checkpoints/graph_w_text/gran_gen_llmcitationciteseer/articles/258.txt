Query expansion is a crucial step in Information Retrieval (IR) systems to improve search results. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach using adaptive contextualized embeddings, dubbed ACE-QE. ACE-QE leverages pre-trained language models to generate context-aware embeddings for query terms and documents. Our method adaptively adjusts the embedding dimensions and weights based on the query complexity and document relevance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACE-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of precision and recall, while reducing computational overhead.
