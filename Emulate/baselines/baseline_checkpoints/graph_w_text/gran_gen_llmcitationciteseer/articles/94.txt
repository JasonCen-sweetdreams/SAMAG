Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational costs and limited interpretability. This paper presents 'HATN', a novel hierarchical attention network that detects anomalies in time-series data with improved efficiency and explainability. HATN leverages a multi-scale attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant time-series segments, reducing the computational complexity of anomaly detection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HATN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and speed, while providing intuitive visualizations of anomaly patterns.
