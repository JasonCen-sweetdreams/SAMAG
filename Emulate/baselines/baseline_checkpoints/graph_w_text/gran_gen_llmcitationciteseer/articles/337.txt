Coordinating multiple agents in dynamic environments is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable cooperation among agents. Our approach leverages a hierarchical representation of the environment, allowing agents to selectively focus on relevant features and communicate with each other through a learned attention mechanism. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate and interpretability of agent decisions.
