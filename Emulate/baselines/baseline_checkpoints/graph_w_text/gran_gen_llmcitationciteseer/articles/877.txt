Ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) systems rely heavily on effective query expansion techniques to improve retrieval accuracy. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepQuery', which leverages deep reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query expansion. Our method employs a Markov decision process to model the query expansion process, where an RL agent learns to select the most informative expansion terms based on user feedback. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQuery outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in both precision and recall.
