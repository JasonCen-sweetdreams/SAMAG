This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism for cooperative task allocation in multi-agent systems. Our approach leverages the concept of combinatorial auctions to efficiently allocate tasks to agents while minimizing communication overhead and ensuring system-wide optimality. We introduce a decentralized auction protocol that allows agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences, and develop a novel pricing scheme to incentivize truthful bidding. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in various multi-agent domains, including search and rescue, and surveillance tasks.
