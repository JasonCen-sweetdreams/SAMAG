Neural search engines have gained popularity due to their ability to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. However, they often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, where the query and document vocabularies differ. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'EmbedExpan', which leverages word embeddings to generate context-aware expansion terms. We demonstrate that EmbedExpan outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as Rocchio and latent semantic analysis, in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our approach achieves significant improvements in precision and recall, while reducing the computational overhead of query expansion.
