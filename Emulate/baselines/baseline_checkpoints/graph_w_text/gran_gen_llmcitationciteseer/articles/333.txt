In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving system-level goals. This paper proposes a novel approach to dynamic task allocation using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our method, 'AgentGCN', models agent interactions as a graph and learns to allocate tasks by predicting the optimal assignment of agents to tasks based on their capabilities, availability, and communication constraints. We evaluate AgentGCN on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional optimization-based approaches.
