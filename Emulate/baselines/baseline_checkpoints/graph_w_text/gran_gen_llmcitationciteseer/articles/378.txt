Distributed database systems often struggle with optimizing subquery execution, leading to poor performance and increased latency. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust subquery execution plans. Our method, 'RL-SQE', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal subquery execution strategy based on the current system workload and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that RL-SQE outperforms traditional cost-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while maintaining comparable accuracy.
