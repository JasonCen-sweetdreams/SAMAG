Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, where the goal is to reformulate the user's query to better capture their search intent. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. Our method, called DeepQE, leverages a transformer-based architecture to learn a dense representation of the query and its context. We demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, such as pseudo-relevance feedback and term weighting, on several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to varying query lengths and can be adapted to different domains with minimal fine-tuning.
