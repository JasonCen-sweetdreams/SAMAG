With the growing adoption of virtual reality (VR) technology, it is essential to understand the factors that influence user engagement. This study explores the impact of personalized avatar customization on user experience in VR environments. We designed a VR platform that allows users to create customized avatars using a combination of machine learning-based facial recognition and manual input. Our user study (N=100) reveals a significant increase in user engagement, measured through time spent in the VR environment and self-reported satisfaction, when users are able to create personalized avatars. We also identify key design factors that contribute to this effect, including avatar realism and controllability.
