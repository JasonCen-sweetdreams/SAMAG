Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis, but traditional methods struggle with high-dimensional data. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepHier', which leverages deep neural networks to learn compact, hierarchical representations of data. We introduce a multi-resolution clustering objective that encourages the discovery of clusters at multiple scales, and develop an efficient optimization algorithm that scales to large datasets. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepHier outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and efficiency, particularly in high-dimensional regimes.
