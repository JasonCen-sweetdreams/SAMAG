This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for multi-modal social network analysis. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between users, and hierarchical representations to integrate multiple modalities, such as text, images, and graphs. We evaluate HGAT on a large-scale social media dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting user engagement and identifying influential individuals. Experimental results show that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
