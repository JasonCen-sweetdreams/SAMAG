This paper addresses the problem of coordinated task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities need to be assigned to tasks with diverse requirements. We propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the interaction between agents and tasks. Our method, called GraphAgent, learns a latent representation of the agent-task graph and optimizes task assignments using a decentralized, iterative refinement process. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that GraphAgent outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
