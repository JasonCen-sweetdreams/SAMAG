This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to allocate tasks efficiently. We propose an auction-based mechanism that exploits the agents' local knowledge to determine task assignments, thereby improving overall system performance. Our approach incorporates a novel bidding strategy that takes into account the agents' capabilities, task dependencies, and communication constraints. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient task allocation and improved system performance.
