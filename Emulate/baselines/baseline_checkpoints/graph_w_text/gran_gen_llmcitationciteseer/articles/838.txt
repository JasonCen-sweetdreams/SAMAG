In heterogeneous multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem due to varying agent capabilities and dynamic environment conditions. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach, called DRL-TA, utilizes a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn a task allocation policy. We evaluate DRL-TA in a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
