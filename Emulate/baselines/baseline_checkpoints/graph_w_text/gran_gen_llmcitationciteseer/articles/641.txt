Distributed document-oriented databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large collections of semi-structured data. However, query processing in these systems remains a significant performance bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'DocIndex', which leverages the inherent structure of document data to accelerate query execution. Our approach combines a hierarchical indexing scheme with a distributed caching mechanism to minimize query latency and improve overall system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DocIndex outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time while maintaining a low storage overhead.
