Multi-agent systems often require efficient task allocation to achieve complex goals. However, the combinatorial nature of task allocation problems makes them challenging to solve, especially in distributed settings. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to allocate tasks in multi-agent systems. Our method, called 'Distributed Task Allocator' (DTA), uses a decentralized actor-critic framework to learn task allocation policies that maximize system performance. We evaluate DTA in a simulated environment and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing task requirements and agent availability. The results show that DTA outperforms traditional task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion time and system utility.
