This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) and its impact on user experience. We designed a gesture-based interaction system that leverages the user's bodily gestures to control virtual objects. Our user study involving 30 participants revealed that embodied interaction enhances spatial awareness, memory recall, and overall user satisfaction. We also found that users exhibited more exploratory behavior and reported higher levels of engagement and immersion. The results have implications for the design of VR interfaces and suggest that embodied cognition can be a valuable design principle for creating more intuitive and engaging user experiences.
