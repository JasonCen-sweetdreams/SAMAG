Older adults with dementia face significant barriers when interacting with digital systems, leading to social isolation and decreased autonomy. This paper presents 'EasyGesture', a novel gestural interface designed to accommodate the cognitive and motor abilities of this population. We conducted a participatory design process with caregivers and individuals with dementia, resulting in a set of intuitive, error-tolerant gestures for common tasks. A user study yielded high engagement rates and improved task completion times compared to traditional touchscreen interfaces. EasyGesture has the potential to enable more inclusive and accessible digital interactions for older adults with dementia.
