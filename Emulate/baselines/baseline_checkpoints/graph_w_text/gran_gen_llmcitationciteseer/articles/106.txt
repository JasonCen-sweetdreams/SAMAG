Distributed databases have become increasingly popular due to their ability to scale and handle large amounts of data. However, optimizing the join order selection in these systems remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize the join order selection for distributed databases. Our method, called Distributed Join Optimizer (DJO), uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal join order based on the database schema, query patterns, and system workload. We evaluate DJO on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional optimization techniques.
