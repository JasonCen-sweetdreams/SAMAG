Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their adoption among older adults is hindered by difficulties in speech recognition and error mitigation. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a series of interviews and usability studies to identify the key challenges and preferences of this demographic. Our proposed system incorporates a novel speech recognition algorithm that leverages acoustic models adapted to the speech patterns of older adults. We also introduce an error mitigation strategy that utilizes visual and tactile feedback to facilitate corrections. Our evaluation results show significant improvements in speech recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
