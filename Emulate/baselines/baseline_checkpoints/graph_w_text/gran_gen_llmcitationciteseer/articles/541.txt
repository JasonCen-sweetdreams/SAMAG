Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query optimization, which leverages the structural properties of the database schema to minimize data retrieval times. Our approach, called 'GraphOpt', represents the database schema as a graph and uses graph algorithms to identify optimal query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
