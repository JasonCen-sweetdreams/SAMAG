In complex multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving system-level objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to optimize task assignments. Our approach, dubbed 'HierTask', enables agents to learn hierarchical policies that balance local and global objectives. We introduce a novel attention mechanism that facilitates information sharing among agents, leading to improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability. Experimental results on a simulated smart city scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of HierTask in reducing task completion times and increasing overall system utility.
