Graph data has become increasingly prevalent in modern applications, but querying and indexing such data efficiently remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, `MAHGI` (Multi-Attribute Hashing Graph Index), which leverages multi-attribute hashing to facilitate fast query processing on large graph datasets. MAHGI uses a combination of vertex-centric and edge-centric indexing to enable efficient query execution, while also supporting various query types, including graph pattern matching and shortest path queries. Our experimental evaluation on real-world graph datasets demonstrates that MAHGI outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query performance and storage efficiency.
