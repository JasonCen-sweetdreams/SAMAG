As data scales and becomes increasingly distributed, query performance is a major bottleneck in modern database systems. In this paper, we propose an adaptive indexing framework, 'DynIx', which dynamically adjusts index structures based on query workload and data distribution. Our approach leverages machine learning to predict query patterns and identify optimal indexing strategies, reducing query latency by up to 30% compared to traditional static indexing methods. We evaluate DynIx on a real-world e-commerce dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving query performance and resource utilization.
