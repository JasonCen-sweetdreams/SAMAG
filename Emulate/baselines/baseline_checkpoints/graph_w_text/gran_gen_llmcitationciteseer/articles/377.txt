Traditional information retrieval systems rely on hand-crafted features and ranking models, which often struggle to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'ADAPTQR', which leverages adaptive query expansion to improve document retrieval performance. Our approach integrates a query-aware document encoder with a hierarchical attention mechanism, allowing the model to focus on relevant contextual information and iteratively refine the query representation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ADAPTQR, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
