Virtual reality (VR) systems often rely on pre-defined gestural interfaces, which can be limiting and frustrating for users. This paper presents a novel approach to designing adaptive gestural interfaces for VR using machine learning. We propose a framework that leverages user behavior data and gesture recognition algorithms to dynamically adapt the interface to individual users' preferences and abilities. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach improves user experience and task performance in VR applications. We also discuss the implications of our findings for designing more accessible and user-centered VR systems.
