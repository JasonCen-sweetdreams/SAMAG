Specialized search engines, such as those used in patent or academic databases, often require precise query formulation to retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach for query reformulation, which leverages a combination of natural language processing and information retrieval techniques. Our model, called 'DeepRef', learns to identify ambiguous or underspecified query terms and generates alternative formulations that improve retrieval performance. Experimental results on a large patent database demonstrate that DeepRef outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision and a 30% reduction in query latency.
