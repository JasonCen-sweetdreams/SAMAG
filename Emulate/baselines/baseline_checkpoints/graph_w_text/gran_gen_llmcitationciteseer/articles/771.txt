Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but the potential of embodied cognition in VR remains under-explored. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interaction framework that leverages embodied cognition principles to enhance user experience in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, comparing our framework to traditional controller-based interaction. Results show that our approach improves user engagement, reduces cognitive load, and increases overall satisfaction. We discuss implications for VR interaction design and highlight avenues for future research.
