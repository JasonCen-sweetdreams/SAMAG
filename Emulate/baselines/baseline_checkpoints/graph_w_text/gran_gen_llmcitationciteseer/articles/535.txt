This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using deep reinforcement learning. We formulate the task allocation problem as a Markov decision process and employ a multi-agent deep Q-network (MA-DQN) to learn optimal allocation strategies. Our approach enables agents to adapt to changing task requirements and agent capabilities in real-time, without relying on a centralized controller. Experimental results on a simulated robotics environment demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized allocation methods.
