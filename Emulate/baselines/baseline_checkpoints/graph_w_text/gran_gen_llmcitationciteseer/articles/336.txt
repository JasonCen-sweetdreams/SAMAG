Conversational interfaces are increasingly prevalent, but their anthropomorphic design can influence user trust. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the effects of anthropomorphic design elements (e.g., avatars, personas) on user trust in conversational interfaces. We conducted a between-subjects experiment with 120 participants, analyzing their interactions with and perceptions of two chatbot prototypes: a minimalist, functional design and an anthropomorphized design. Results show that users perceive anthropomorphized chatbots as more trustworthy, but this effect is mitigated by users' prior experience with conversational interfaces. We discuss implications for HCI designers and provide recommendations for balancing anthropomorphism with user trust.
