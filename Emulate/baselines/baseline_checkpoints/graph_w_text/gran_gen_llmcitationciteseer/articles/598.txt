Few-shot image classification has garnered significant attention in recent years, but most existing methods rely on complex meta-learning algorithms or large-scale datasets. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Prototypical Networks (HPN), which leverages a hierarchical representation of prototypes to improve few-shot classification accuracy. We demonstrate that HPN can adapt to new classes with only a few examples, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets such as mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet. Furthermore, we show that HPN can be seamlessly integrated with existing meta-learning frameworks, enhancing their performance in low-data regimes.
