With the exponential growth of digital data, efficient document filtering has become a critical component of information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'DocFilter', which leverages the strengths of both traditional filtering methods and modern neural networks. Our model combines a hierarchical attention mechanism with a learned term weighting scheme, demonstrating significant improvements in filtering accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DocFilter reduces the number of irrelevant documents by 30% while maintaining a high recall rate.
