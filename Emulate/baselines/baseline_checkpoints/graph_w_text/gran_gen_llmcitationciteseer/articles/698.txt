Distributed databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management systems. However, optimizing query execution in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database's current workload and system resources. Our experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
