Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our VR system incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified interfaces and personalized navigation, to facilitate engagement and independence. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrates improved usability and enjoyment compared to existing VR systems.
