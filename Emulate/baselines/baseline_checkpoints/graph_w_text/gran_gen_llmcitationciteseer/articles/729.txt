Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems. However, the join order enumeration problem remains a significant bottleneck due to its inherent complexity. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize join order enumeration. We design a deep Q-network that learns to navigate the exponentially large search space of possible join orders, guided by a reward function that balances query execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x on complex queries.
