Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the challenge lies in capturing the nuances of user queries. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, which learns to identify and incorporate relevant contextual information from the query. Our proposed model, 'NeuroQE', leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture both local and global dependencies in the query. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that NeuroQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
