In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach, called HetMAL, learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a graph, and uses GNNs to capture complex dependencies between them. HetMAL outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of allocation efficiency, adaptability to changing task requirements, and robustness to agent failures. We evaluate HetMAL on a variety of scenarios, including search and rescue, and surveillance, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.
