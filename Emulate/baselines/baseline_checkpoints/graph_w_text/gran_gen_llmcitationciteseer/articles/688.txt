Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. We propose a neural IR model, 'NeuroQE', which learns to expand queries by predicting relevant terms that capture the semantic intent of the original query. NeuroQE leverages a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion and relevance ranking, thus improving the overall retrieval performance. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, especially for ambiguous and under-specified queries.
