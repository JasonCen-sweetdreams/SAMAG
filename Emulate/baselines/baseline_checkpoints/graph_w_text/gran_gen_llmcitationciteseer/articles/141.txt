This paper presents a novel approach to designing gesture-based interfaces that are accessible and usable by older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with varying levels of motor impairment, using a custom-built gesture recognition system. Our results show that a combination of machine learning-based gesture recognition and adaptive feedback mechanisms can significantly improve interaction accuracy and user satisfaction. We also identify key design recommendations for inclusive gesture-based interfaces, including the use of compensatory gestures and personalized feedback schemes.
