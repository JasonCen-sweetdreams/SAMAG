Traditional indexing techniques for document retrieval suffer from high memory requirements and slow query processing times. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural indexing approach, 'HierIndex', which leverages the strengths of both neural networks and traditional indexing methods. HierIndex uses a hierarchical structure of neural networks to learn a compact representation of documents, enabling efficient similarity search and retrieval. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierIndex achieves significant improvements in query processing time and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining competitive retrieval accuracy.
