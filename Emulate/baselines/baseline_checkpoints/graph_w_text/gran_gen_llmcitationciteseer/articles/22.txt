Deep learning-based retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc search tasks. However, the role of query expansion in these models remains understudied. This paper investigates the effect of different query expansion techniques on the performance of BERT-based retrieval models. Our experiments on the TREC-2004 dataset show that a carefully designed query expansion strategy can improve the retrieval performance by up to 15%. We also analyze the limitations of existing query expansion methods and propose a novel approach that incorporates semantic role labeling to better capture the context of the query.
