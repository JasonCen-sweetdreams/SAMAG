Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it can significantly impact the relevance and ranking of retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages semantic relationships between query terms and documents to generate effective expansion terms. We employ a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global context, enabling the model to adapt to diverse query styles and document collections. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
