This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous agent navigation in dynamic environments using reinforcement learning. We propose a deep Q-network-based algorithm that enables agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as moving obstacles or changing terrain, in real-time. Our approach leverages a combination of visual and sensorimotor inputs to learn a robust policy for navigation, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in a variety of simulated and real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional planning-based methods in terms of navigation efficiency and safety.
