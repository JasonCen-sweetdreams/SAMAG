In multi-agent systems, planning efficient paths for multiple agents is a challenging problem. Existing methods often rely on centralized approaches, which can be computationally expensive and brittle. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables decentralized, real-time path planning for multiple agents. By incorporating attention mechanisms at both local and global levels, our HAN model learns to prioritize relevant information and coordinate agent movements. Experimental results on a variety of scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of path efficiency, collision avoidance, and scalability.
