Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant passages from a large corpus that contain the answer to a given question. This paper presents a novel approach to passage retrieval using dense passage representations, which enables fast and accurate similarity search. We propose a hierarchical clustering-based method to index passages and a neural ranking model to re-rank the retrieved passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
