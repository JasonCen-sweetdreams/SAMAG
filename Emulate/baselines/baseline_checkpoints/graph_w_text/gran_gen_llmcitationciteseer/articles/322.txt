Resource allocation in cloud computing is a complex problem that requires efficient optimization of virtual machine placement, scaling, and migration. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'CloudOpt', that learns to optimize resource allocation policies in cloud environments. We design a modular DRL architecture that integrates a deep Q-network with a graph neural network to capture complex dependencies between VMs and physical resources. Experimental results on a real-world cloud dataset show that CloudOpt outperforms state-of-the-art heuristics and optimization techniques in terms of resource utilization, latency, and energy efficiency.
