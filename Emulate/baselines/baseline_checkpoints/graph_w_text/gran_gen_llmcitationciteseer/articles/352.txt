Cooperative multi-agent planning is a challenging problem, especially when agents have incomplete information about their environment. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning approach to tackle this issue. We propose a decentralized framework where agents learn to share information and coordinate their actions to achieve a common goal. Our method utilizes a graph neural network to represent the agent's observation and a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods in various multi-agent planning scenarios, including robotic soccer and autonomous driving.
