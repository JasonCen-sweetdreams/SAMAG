As AI systems become increasingly integrated into decision-making processes, understanding the dynamics of human-AI collaboration is crucial. This paper investigates the role of cognitive biases in human-AI collaboration, focusing on the anchoring bias, confirmation bias, and availability heuristic. We conduct a user study with 120 participants, analyzing their decision-making behaviors when interacting with AI-driven recommendation systems. Our results show that cognitive biases significantly influence human trust in AI and decision outcomes, highlighting the need for bias-aware AI design and training strategies. We propose a framework for identifying and mitigating cognitive biases in human-AI collaboration, enabling more effective and trustworthy decision-making.
