As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent in design and collaboration, it is essential to understand the role of embodiment in shaping user experience. This paper presents a study on gesture-based interaction in collaborative design, examining how users' bodily gestures influence their perception of virtual objects and interaction with co-designers. Our findings suggest that embodied interaction enhances spatial awareness, reduces cognitive load, and fosters more effective collaboration. We propose a novel framework for integrating embodiment into VR-based design tools, highlighting the potential for more immersive and effective design experiences.
