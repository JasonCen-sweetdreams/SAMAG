As online learning platforms proliferate, optimizing user engagement has become a crucial concern. This study investigates the effectiveness of personalized avatar-based feedback in virtual learning environments. We designed an immersive virtual reality interface that provides learners with a customized avatar, which offers real-time guidance and encouragement. Our mixed-methods approach combines gesture recognition, sentiment analysis, and user surveys to quantify the impact of avatar-based feedback on learner motivation, self-efficacy, and knowledge retention. Results indicate that personalized avatars significantly enhance user engagement, particularly among novice learners, and improve overall learning outcomes.
