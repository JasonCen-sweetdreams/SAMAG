Distributed document-oriented databases (DDODBs) have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large amounts of semi-structured data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'DocOpt', which leverages a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to efficiently optimize queries in DDODBs. Our approach utilizes a cost-based model to estimate the execution time of alternative query plans and selects the most efficient one. Experimental results on a large-scale DDODB benchmark demonstrate that DocOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
