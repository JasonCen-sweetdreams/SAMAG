Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR interfaces often present accessibility barriers. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating accessible VR interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants, combining interviews, surveys, and usability testing. Our findings inform the development of a novel VR interface framework, 'CARE', which incorporates cognitive support features, tactile feedback, and simplified navigation. A pilot study demonstrates the efficacy of CARE in improving user experience and reducing cognitive load.
