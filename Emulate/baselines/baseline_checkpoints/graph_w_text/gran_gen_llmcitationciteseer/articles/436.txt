Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important in today's fast-paced business environment. However, optimizing queries for low-latency execution remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using column-store indexing, tailored to the specific needs of real-time data warehousing. Our method, 'RTOpt', efficiently identifies the most critical columns and leverages a hybrid indexing strategy to minimize query execution time. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RTOpt reduces query latency by up to 75% compared to traditional row-store indexing, making it suitable for real-time analytics and reporting applications.
