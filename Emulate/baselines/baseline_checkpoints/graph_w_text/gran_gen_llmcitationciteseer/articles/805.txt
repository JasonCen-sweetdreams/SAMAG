This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, inspired by evolutionary game theory. Our approach, called EVO-MAS, models the task allocation problem as a repeated game between agents, where each agent learns to adapt its strategy to maximize its payoff. We introduce a new genetic algorithm-based mechanism to evolve the agents' strategies, which converges to a Nash equilibrium. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that EVO-MAS outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency.
