In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based approach, 'RL-TA', for dynamic task allocation in distributed environments. RL-TA leverages a decentralized Q-network to learn optimal task assignments for each agent, taking into account changing environment conditions and agent capabilities. We evaluate RL-TA in simulations of search-and-rescue and surveillance scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to traditional auction-based methods.
