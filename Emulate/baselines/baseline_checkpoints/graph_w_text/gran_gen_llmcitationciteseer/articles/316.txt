Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have become increasingly popular, but their adoption is hindered by user experience issues. This paper investigates the effect of haptic feedback on user experience in VR. We designed an experiment to compare user performance and satisfaction in two VR interfaces: one with haptic feedback and one without. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user performance in tasks requiring spatial awareness and manipulation, while also reducing user frustration and fatigue. We also propose a novel metric, Haptic Experience Score (HES), to quantify the impact of haptic feedback on user experience.
