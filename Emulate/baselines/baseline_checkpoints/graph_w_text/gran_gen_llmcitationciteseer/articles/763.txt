This paper presents a novel gesture-based interface design approach tailored to older adults with motor impairments. Our system, called 'EasyGesture', utilizes machine learning-based gesture recognition to adapt to individual users' abilities and compensate for motor variability. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional gesture-based interfaces. EasyGesture's adaptive nature enables older adults to interact with technology more effectively, promoting digital inclusion and independence.
