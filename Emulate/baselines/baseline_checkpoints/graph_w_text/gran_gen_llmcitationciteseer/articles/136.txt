Main-memory databases have revolutionized data processing by providing low-latency and high-throughput performance. However, indexing high-dimensional data in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, 'HDTree', which leverages the properties of main-memory databases to achieve scalable and efficient indexing for high-dimensional data. HDTree uses a hybrid indexing structure that combines the benefits of tree-based and hash-based indexing, resulting in improved query performance and reduced memory usage. Experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that HDTree outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query efficiency and scalability.
