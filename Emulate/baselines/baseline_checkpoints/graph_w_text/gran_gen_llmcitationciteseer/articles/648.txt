This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems, leveraging distributed constraint optimization techniques. We propose a hierarchical framework that enables agents to negotiate and allocate tasks while respecting constraints on resource availability, communication bandwidth, and temporal dependencies. Our method, dubbed 'DCAgent', is shown to outperform existing decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and robustness to agent failures. We evaluate DCAgent in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating its effectiveness in coordinating autonomous vehicles and drones.
