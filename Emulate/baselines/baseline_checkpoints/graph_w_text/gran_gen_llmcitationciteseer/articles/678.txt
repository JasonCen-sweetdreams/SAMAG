Long-tail classification problems, where class distributions are heavily skewed, remain a significant challenge in machine learning. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that adaptively focuses on relevant features and instances to improve classification accuracy. Our HAN model consists of two stages: a feature attention module that weights important input features and a instance attention module that selects informative samples. We evaluate our approach on several long-tail image classification benchmarks, demonstrating significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, including resampling and reweighting techniques.
