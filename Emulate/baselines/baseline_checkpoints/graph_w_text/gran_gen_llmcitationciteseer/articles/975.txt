Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, particularly for short text documents where the query context is limited. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'NeuroExpan', which learns to expand queries by modeling the semantic relationships between words and documents. Our approach leverages pre-trained language models and fine-tunes them on a large corpus of text data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExpan significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, resulting in improved retrieval precision and recall.
