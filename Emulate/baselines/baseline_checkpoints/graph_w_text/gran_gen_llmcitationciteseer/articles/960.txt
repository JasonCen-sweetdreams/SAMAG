Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, but traditional methods often struggle with vocabulary mismatch and term ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel neural approach, 'NeuroXPand', which leverages proximity graphs to model semantic relationships between queries and documents. By learning a dense representation of the query-document graph, NeuroXPand effectively captures nuanced context and improves retrieval performance. We evaluate our approach on several standard benchmarks, demonstrating significant gains in mean average precision and NDCG@10 compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
