Explainable AI-driven recommendation systems aim to provide personalized suggestions while revealing the underlying decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that integrates graph-based user modeling with attention-based item embedding. HGAT learns to recursively attend to user-item interactions, capturing complex relationships and generating interpretable explanations. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy, diversity, and explainability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
