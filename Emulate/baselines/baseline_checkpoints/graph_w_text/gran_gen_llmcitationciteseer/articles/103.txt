Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture the semantics of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance query representation by incorporating graph-based semantic embeddings. We leverage knowledge graphs to construct a query graph, which is then embedded into a dense vector space using a graph neural network. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries with complex semantics.
