Coordinating heterogeneous agents is a crucial challenge in multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a decentralized optimization framework, 'DMAgent', that tackles this problem by formulating it as a decentralized multi-objective optimization problem. DMAgent employs a novel combination of distributed constraint optimization and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to find Pareto-optimal solutions that balance individual agent objectives with global system performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DMAgent in coordinating heterogeneous agents in a simulated smart grid scenario, achieving improved system efficiency and scalability compared to centralized optimization approaches.
