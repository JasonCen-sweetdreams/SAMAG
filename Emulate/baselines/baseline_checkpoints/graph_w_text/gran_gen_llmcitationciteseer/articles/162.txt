As the global population ages, designing accessible and user-friendly interfaces for elderly users becomes increasingly important. This study investigates the role of gamification in reducing cognitive load for older adults when interacting with digital systems. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 30 participants aged 65-85, examining the impact of gamification elements on cognitive load, user engagement, and task performance. Our results show that gamification significantly decreases cognitive load and improves user experience, particularly for tasks requiring working memory and attention. We discuss the implications for HCI design principles and guidelines tailored to the needs of elderly users.
