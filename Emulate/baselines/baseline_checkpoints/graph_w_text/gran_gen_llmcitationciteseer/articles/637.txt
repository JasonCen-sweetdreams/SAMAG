The increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads demands efficient coordination mechanisms to ensure safety and traffic efficiency. This paper proposes a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, 'AV-Coord', to facilitate real-time decision-making among AVs in complex traffic scenarios. AV-Coord combines a high-level coordinator agent with distributed low-level agents, each responsible for controlling an individual AV. We evaluate AV-Coord in a simulated urban environment, demonstrating improved traffic flow and reduced congestion compared to traditional decentralized AV control strategies.
