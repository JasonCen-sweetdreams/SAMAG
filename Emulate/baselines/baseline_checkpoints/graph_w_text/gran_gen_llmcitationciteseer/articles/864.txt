Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between queries and documents. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'RL-QE', which learns to generate effective expansion terms by interacting with the retrieval environment. Our approach leverages a hierarchical policy network to select expansion terms based on their predicted relevance and coverage of the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and NDCG.
