This paper proposes a novel framework for decentralized coordination of autonomous agents in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach that enables agents to learn both individual and collaborative policies. The framework consists of a high-level coordination module that guides the agents' behavior and a low-level decision-making module that adapts to changing environmental conditions. Experimental evaluations in a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient and scalable coordination of agents.
