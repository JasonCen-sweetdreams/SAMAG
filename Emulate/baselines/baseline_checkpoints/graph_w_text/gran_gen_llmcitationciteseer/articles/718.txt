Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on execution times. Our experiments on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
