Few-shot node classification is a challenging task in graph-structured data, where only a limited number of labeled nodes are available for training. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages self-supervised learning to learn node representations from unlabeled data. HGAT consists of a hierarchical clustering module that recursively partitions the graph into smaller clusters, followed by a graph attention module that aggregates node features within each cluster. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification tasks, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 12.5%.
