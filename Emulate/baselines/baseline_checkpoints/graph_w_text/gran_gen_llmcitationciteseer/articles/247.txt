Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, have become increasingly prevalent in daily life. However, older adults often face difficulties using these systems due to cognitive, sensory, and motor impairments. This paper presents a mixed-methods study that combines user research, usability testing, and design prototyping to develop accessible conversational interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults. Our findings highlight the importance of designing for simplicity, clarity, and flexibility, and provide recommendations for improving the accessibility of conversational interfaces for this population.
