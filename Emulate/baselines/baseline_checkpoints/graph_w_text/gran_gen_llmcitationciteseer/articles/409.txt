Query optimization is a crucial step in database systems, but it remains a challenging problem due to the exponential search space of possible query plans. This paper presents 'GraphOpt', a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning and graph embeddings to accelerate query optimization. By modeling the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process, we use deep Q-networks to learn an effective query plan generator. We also propose a graph embedding technique to capture the structural dependencies between query operators, allowing the model to generalize to unseen queries. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of optimization time and achieves comparable plan quality.
