Effective visualization of 3D medical data is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. This paper presents an innovative gaze-based interaction system for augmented reality (AR) visualization of 3D medical data. Our approach leverages eye-tracking technology to enable users to intuitively manipulate and explore 3D models of patient data in AR. We evaluate our system through a user study, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional interaction methods. The results have implications for the development of more intuitive and accessible AR-based medical visualization tools.
