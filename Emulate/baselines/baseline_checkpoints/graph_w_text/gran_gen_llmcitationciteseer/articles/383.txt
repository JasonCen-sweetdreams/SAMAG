Conversational interfaces have become increasingly popular, but their accessibility for people with disabilities remains a significant concern. This paper presents an empirical study on the design of accessible conversational interfaces for individuals with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with participants from diverse disability groups, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a novel framework, 'AccessibleChat', which incorporates personalized accommodations, multimodal input/output, and adaptive error correction. We evaluate the effectiveness of AccessibleChat through a usability study, demonstrating significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates for participants with disabilities.
