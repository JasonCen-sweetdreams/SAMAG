Question answering (QA) systems rely heavily on effective retrieval mechanisms to identify relevant passages. This paper presents a hierarchical neural retrieval framework, 'HNRF', which leverages a combination of semantic and syntactic features to retrieve top-ranked passages. We propose a novel attention-based neural ranking model that captures nuanced relationships between questions and passages, and integrate it with a hierarchical clustering algorithm to reduce the search space. Experimental results on the SQuAD dataset demonstrate that HNRF achieves a 15% improvement in retrieval accuracy and a 30% reduction in computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art QA systems.
