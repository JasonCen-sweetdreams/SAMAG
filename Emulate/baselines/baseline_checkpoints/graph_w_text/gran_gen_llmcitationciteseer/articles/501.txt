Few-shot node classification in graph-structured data is a challenging task, particularly when only a few labeled nodes are available. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs. HGAT consists of hierarchical layers that capture graph structural properties at multiple scales, enabling it to generalize well to unseen nodes and graphs. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification tasks, showcasing its potential in real-world applications such as recommender systems and social network analysis.
