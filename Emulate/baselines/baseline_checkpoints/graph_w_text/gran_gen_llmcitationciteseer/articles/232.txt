As robots increasingly enter human-centric environments, effective human-robot collaboration (HRC) is crucial. This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in HRC, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We design and evaluate a novel gestureset for robot control, incorporating insights from cognitive linguistics and human-computer interaction. Our user study reveals that embodied cognition principles can significantly improve task performance, user experience, and robot anthropomorphism. The results have implications for the design of intuitive and efficient HRC systems in various applications, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and home assistance.
