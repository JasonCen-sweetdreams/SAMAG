As database systems continue to scale, query optimization becomes increasingly complex. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics and rule-based systems, which often fail to capture the nuances of modern distributed databases. This paper explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to query optimization. We propose a novel DRL framework, 'QOptRL', which learns to optimize queries by interacting with a simulated database environment. Our experiments demonstrate that QOptRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of execution time and plan quality, particularly for complex queries and large-scale datasets.
