Data warehousing has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence, but the rapid growth of real-time data demands efficient indexing techniques to support fast query performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'RTIndex', which leverages a combination of column-store indexing and in-memory caching to accelerate query execution. We also introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that adaptively selects the most effective indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that RTIndex outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
