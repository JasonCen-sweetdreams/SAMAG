Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with large-scale column-store databases. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RTOpt', which leverages machine learning to predict query execution times and optimize query plans in real-time. We demonstrate that RTOpt achieves significant performance improvements over traditional optimization techniques, with an average reduction of 35% in query latency on a benchmark dataset.
