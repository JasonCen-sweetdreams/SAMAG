This paper presents a novel approach to designing gesture recognition systems that adapt to the unique needs of individuals with motor impairments. Our proposed system, 'Adapta Gesture', employs a machine learning-based framework that learns to recognize and compensate for the variability in gesture patterns exhibited by individuals with motor impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating that Adapta Gesture achieves an average recognition accuracy of 92.5%, outperforming existing gesture recognition systems. Our findings have significant implications for the development of accessible HCI systems that can be used by individuals with motor impairments.
