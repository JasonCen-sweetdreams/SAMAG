In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism, 'MASA', that enables agents to bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We introduce a novel bidding strategy that incorporates uncertainty and risk-aversion, leading to improved task allocation efficiency and fairness. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that MASA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion rate and agent satisfaction.
