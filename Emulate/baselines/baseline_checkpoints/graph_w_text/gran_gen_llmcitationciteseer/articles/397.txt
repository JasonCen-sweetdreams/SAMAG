The increasing prevalence of distributed database systems (DDBS) integrating heterogeneous data sources has introduced new challenges in query optimization. This paper proposes a novel cost-based optimization framework, 'HetOpt', which leverages machine learning and data profiling to efficiently optimize queries in DDBS. We introduce a probabilistic modeling approach to capture data distribution and correlation across different data sources, enabling more accurate cost estimation and optimization. Experimental results on a real-world DDBS benchmark demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing optimization techniques.
