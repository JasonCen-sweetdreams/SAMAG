Anomaly detection in industrial IoT time-series data is crucial for predictive maintenance and quality control. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that leverages both local and global patterns in the data. Our approach consists of a multi-scale feature extractor, a hierarchical attention module, and a probabilistic anomaly scoring function. Experimental results on three industrial datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and false alarm rate, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data.
