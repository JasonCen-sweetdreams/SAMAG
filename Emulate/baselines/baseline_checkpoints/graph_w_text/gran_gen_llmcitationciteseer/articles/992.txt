This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for adaptive traffic signal control. Our approach, called 'TrafficMA', leverages real-time traffic data to train a coalition of agents, each responsible for controlling a traffic signal in a network. By employing a decentralized, communication-based strategy, TrafficMA adapts to dynamic traffic patterns, reducing congestion and travel times. We evaluate TrafficMA using real-world traffic data from Pittsburgh, demonstrating improved performance compared to traditional, fixed-timing signal control methods.
