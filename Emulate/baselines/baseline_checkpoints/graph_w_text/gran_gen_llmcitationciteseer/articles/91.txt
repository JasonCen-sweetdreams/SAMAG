This study examines the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed an immersive VR game with customizable avatars and recruited 120 participants for a within-subjects experiment. Our results show that participants who used personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, measured by time spent in the game and self-reported enjoyment, compared to those using non-personalized avatars. We also found that personalization increased the sense of presence and embodiment in the virtual environment. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of VR-based training, education, and entertainment applications.
