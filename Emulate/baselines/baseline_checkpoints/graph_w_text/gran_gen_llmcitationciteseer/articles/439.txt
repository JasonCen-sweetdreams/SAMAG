Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems often rely on multi-modal sensors to monitor equipment health. However, integrating data from diverse sources poses significant challenges. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for multi-modal sensor fusion in industrial anomaly detection. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model complex relationships between sensors and attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant modalities. Experimental results on a real-world industrial dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting anomalies, while providing interpretability of sensor contributions.
