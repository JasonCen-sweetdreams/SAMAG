Multi-label node classification is a fundamental problem in graph-based learning, where each node can have multiple labels. Existing state-of-the-art methods, such as graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and graph attention networks (GATs), are limited in their ability to capture complex relationships between nodes and labels. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAN) architecture, which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively aggregate features from different nodes and labels. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms existing methods in terms of micro-F1 score and label-wise accuracy, and provides better interpretability of node-label relationships.
