In multi-agent systems, decision-making often involves complex interactions and dependencies among agents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture to enable explainable decision-making in such systems. Our approach learns to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, generating interpretable attention weights that reveal the underlying causal relationships. We evaluate our method on a variety of multi-agent domains, demonstrating improved decision-making performance and providing insights into the decision-making process. Our framework has potential applications in autonomous systems, smart grids, and other real-world domains.
