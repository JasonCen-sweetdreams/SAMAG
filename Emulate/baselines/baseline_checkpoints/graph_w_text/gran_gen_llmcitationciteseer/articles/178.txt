Gesture-based interaction in virtual reality (VR) has gained popularity, but the role of embodied cognition in shaping user experience remains understudied. We investigate how embodied cognition influences users' gestures, sense of agency, and overall performance in VR tasks. Our study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining behavioral data from a gesture-tracking experiment with qualitative insights from think-aloud protocols. Results show that users who exhibit stronger embodied cognition traits tend to perform better in VR tasks and exhibit more intuitive gestures. We discuss implications for the design of more effective and engaging gesture-based interfaces in VR.
