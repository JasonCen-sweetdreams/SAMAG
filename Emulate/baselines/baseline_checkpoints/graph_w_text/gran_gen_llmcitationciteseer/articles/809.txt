Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval that involves adding relevant terms to the original query to improve retrieval performance. Existing methods rely on hand-crafted rules or statistical models, which may not capture the complexities of real-world queries. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach, 'RL-QE', that learns to expand queries by interactively exploring the search space. We define a reward function that balances retrieval accuracy and query efficiency, and train an agent to select optimal expansion terms. Experiments on the TREC dataset demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of MAP and NDCG metrics, while reducing query latency by up to 30%.
