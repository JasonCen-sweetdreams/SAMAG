Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults, but existing VR systems often neglect their unique needs and abilities. This paper presents a participatory design approach to creating inclusive VR experiences for older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and HCI experts to identify key accessibility barriers and opportunities for innovation. Our findings inform the development of a novel VR system that incorporates adaptive interfaces, personalized feedback, and social features to support older adults' cognitive, physical, and emotional well-being. A user study with 20 older adults demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.
