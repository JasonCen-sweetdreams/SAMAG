Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in many applications, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'TS-Anomaly', which leverages the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. TS-Anomaly uses a hierarchical architecture to capture both local and global patterns in time series data, enabling the detection of anomalies with high accuracy. We evaluate TS-Anomaly on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
