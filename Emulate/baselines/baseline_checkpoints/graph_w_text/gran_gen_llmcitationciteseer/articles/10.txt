This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework for autonomous agents, leveraging auction-based mechanisms to optimize task assignments. We introduce a decentralized auction protocol, 'AgentAuction', which enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and availability. Our approach ensures efficient task allocation, minimizes communication overhead, and adapts to dynamic changes in the agent network. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced latency compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
