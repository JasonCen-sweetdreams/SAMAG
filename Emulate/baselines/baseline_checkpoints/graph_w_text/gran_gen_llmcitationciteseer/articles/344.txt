This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for real-time traffic signal control. Our approach, dubbed 'TrafficMA', leverages a decentralized architecture to handle large-scale traffic networks, where each agent learns to optimize traffic signal timings based on local observations. We introduce a novel communication protocol that enables efficient information sharing among agents, reducing the need for centralized control. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network show that TrafficMA outperforms traditional optimization methods, achieving a 25% reduction in average travel time and a 30% decrease in congestion.
