This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for distributed task allocation in smart grids. We model the problem as a decentralized Markov decision process, where each agent represents a microgrid and learns to allocate tasks to maximize overall efficiency and minimize energy losses. Our approach utilizes a decentralized actor-critic architecture, where each agent learns its own policy and shares knowledge with neighbors to improve global performance. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid environment demonstrate significant improvements in task allocation efficiency and reduced energy losses compared to traditional centralized approaches.
