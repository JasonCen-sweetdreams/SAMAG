Intelligent transportation systems can significantly reduce congestion and improve traffic flow. This paper presents a novel framework for coordinating traffic signal control using a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. We model the traffic network as a multi-agent system, where each agent represents an intersection. Our algorithm, 'HierTraffic', learns a hierarchical policy that coordinates the agents to optimize traffic flow. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate that HierTraffic outperforms traditional fixed-timing and adaptive signal control methods, reducing average travel time by 23% and increasing network throughput by 17%.
