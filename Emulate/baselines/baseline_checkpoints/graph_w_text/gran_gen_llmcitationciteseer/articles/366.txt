Information retrieval systems rely on efficient document indexing to facilitate rapid query processing. This paper presents a novel neural hashing approach, 'NeuroIndex', which learns compact binary representations of documents to enable fast similarity search. By incorporating a graph-based attention mechanism, NeuroIndex captures semantic relationships between documents and outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of both query performance and storage efficiency. Experimental results on large-scale document collections demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of NeuroIndex in real-world IR applications.
