Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but the role of embodiment in shaping user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining the effects of embodiment on user presence, engagement, and cognitive load in VR. We designed and implemented an immersive VR environment that simulates real-world tasks, and conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants. Results show that embodied interactions significantly enhance user presence and engagement, while reducing cognitive load. Furthermore, our qualitative analysis reveals that users' sense of embodiment influences their perception of agency and control in VR. Implications for the design of embodied VR experiences are discussed.
