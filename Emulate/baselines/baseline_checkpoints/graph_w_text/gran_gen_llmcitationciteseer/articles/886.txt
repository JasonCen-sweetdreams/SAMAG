Graph-based models have shown promise in information retrieval tasks, but scaling to large document collections remains a challenge. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCN) for efficient document retrieval. HGCN leverages a hierarchical graph structure to capture semantic relationships between documents at multiple levels of abstraction. We propose a novel graph pooling mechanism that adaptively selects relevant nodes, reducing computational complexity while preserving retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HGCN outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based models in terms of mean average precision and query processing time.
