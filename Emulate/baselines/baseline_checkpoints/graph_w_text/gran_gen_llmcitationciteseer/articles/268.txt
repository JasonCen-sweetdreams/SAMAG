Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries on these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph data and the distributed nature of the system. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph clustering, subquery decomposition, and adaptive join ordering to minimize query execution time. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world graph dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing query optimization techniques.
