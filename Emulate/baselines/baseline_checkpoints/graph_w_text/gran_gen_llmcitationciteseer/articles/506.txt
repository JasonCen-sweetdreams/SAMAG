Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that effectively integrates and attends to relevant features from different modalities. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers that learn to weigh the importance of each modality and a hierarchical fusion layer that combines the attended features. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal inputs, achieving an average F1-score of 0.853.
