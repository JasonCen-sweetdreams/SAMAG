Task-oriented conversational agents require effective dialogue management to engage users and accomplish tasks efficiently. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention-based dialogue management framework, 'HATDM', which leverages contextual information and user intentions to generate context-dependent responses. We propose a two-stage attention mechanism that first identifies relevant task-related knowledge and then focuses on user-specific goals, enabling the agent to respond accurately and coherently. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that HATDM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task success rate, response relevance, and user satisfaction.
