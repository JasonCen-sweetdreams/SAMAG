Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to handle complex queries, leading to suboptimal results. We propose a novel query expansion approach, 'HGEQE', which leverages hierarchical graph-based embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms. By recursively applying a graph attention mechanism, HGEQE identifies relevant expansion terms and weights them according to their importance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark show that HGEQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 12.5% increase in mean average precision.
