As graph databases continue to grow in size and complexity, query performance becomes a major bottleneck. This paper presents a novel approach to accelerate graph query execution by leveraging GPU-accelerated indexing. We introduce a hybrid indexing scheme that combines traditional CPU-based indexing with GPU-based indexing, allowing for efficient querying of massive graph datasets. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing indexing schemes, with query execution times reduced by up to 75%. Our approach is particularly effective for queries involving complex graph patterns and large datasets.
