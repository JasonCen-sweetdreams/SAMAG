As the global population ages, designing conversation agents that cater to older adults with cognitive impairments is crucial. This paper presents a user-centered approach to developing accessible conversation agents, focusing on individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with MCI, identifying key design requirements and preferences. Our findings inform the development of a novel conversation agent, 'CareChat', which incorporates cognitive support features, such as visual cues, simplified language, and memory aids. A pilot evaluation of CareChat with 20 participants shows significant improvements in user engagement and comprehension compared to traditional conversation agents.
