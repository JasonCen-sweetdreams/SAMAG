Augmented reality (AR) technology has the potential to enhance the daily lives of elderly individuals with cognitive impairments, but existing AR interfaces often neglect their specific needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible and usable AR interfaces for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with elderly participants and caregivers to identify key design requirements, such as simplicity, clear guidance, and error tolerance. Our prototype, 'EasyAR', incorporates these principles and is evaluated through a usability study, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial AR systems.
