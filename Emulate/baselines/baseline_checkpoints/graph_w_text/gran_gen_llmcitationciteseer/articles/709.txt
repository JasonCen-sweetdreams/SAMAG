Query optimization is a critical component in distributed database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to capture semantic relationships between database entities and optimize query plans. We introduce a graph neural network-based model that encodes database schemata and instance data into a low-dimensional vector space, enabling efficient similarity-based pruning of unnecessary join operations. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and CPU utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
