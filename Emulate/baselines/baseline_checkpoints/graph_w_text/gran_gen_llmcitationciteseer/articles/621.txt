Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize social interactions, but current avatar designs often lack emotional expressiveness, limiting users' sense of presence and connection. This paper presents a novel approach to designing emotionally expressive avatars that incorporate subtle, culturally-informed facial cues and body language. We conducted a user study with 120 participants from diverse cultural backgrounds, demonstrating that our avatars enhance emotional understanding, empathy, and social bonding in VR interactions. Our findings have implications for the design of inclusive, culturally-sensitive VR experiences that promote social connection and well-being.
