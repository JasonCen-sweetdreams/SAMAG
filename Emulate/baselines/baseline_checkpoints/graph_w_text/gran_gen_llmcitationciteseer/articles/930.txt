Distributed databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an adaptive workload-aware replication strategy, 'AWARE', which dynamically adjusts data replication based on changing workload patterns. AWARE leverages machine learning-based workload prediction and optimization techniques to minimize query latency and maximize system throughput. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database setup demonstrates that AWARE outperforms existing static replication schemes by up to 35% in terms of query response time, while reducing overall system resource utilization by 20%.
