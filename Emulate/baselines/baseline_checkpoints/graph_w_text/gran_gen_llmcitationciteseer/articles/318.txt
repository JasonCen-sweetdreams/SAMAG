Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive conversational interfaces for this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying key challenges and preferences in interacting with conversational agents. Our findings inform the development of a novel interface framework, 'CARE', which incorporates cognitive support strategies, such as explicit turn-taking cues and simplified language processing. A pilot study with 15 participants demonstrates CARE's effectiveness in improving user experience and reducing cognitive load.
