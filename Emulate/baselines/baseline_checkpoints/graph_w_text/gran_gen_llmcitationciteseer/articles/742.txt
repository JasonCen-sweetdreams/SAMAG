Query expansion is a crucial technique for improving short text retrieval performance. However, traditional methods often rely on shallow lexical features, neglecting the rich semantic relationships between words. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'SemExpand', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate dense semantic embeddings for query terms. By incorporating these embeddings into a probabilistic query expansion framework, we demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness on several benchmark datasets. Our results show that SemExpand outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly for short queries, and provides a new direction for integrating deep learning into information retrieval systems.
