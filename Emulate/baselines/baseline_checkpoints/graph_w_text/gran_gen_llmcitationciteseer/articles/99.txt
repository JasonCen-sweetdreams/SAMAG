Real-world time series data often exhibit complex patterns and anomalies, making detection challenging. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'TS-Anom', which leverages a hybrid convolutional-recurrent neural network (CNN-RNN) architecture to identify anomalies in high-dimensional time series data. TS-Anom incorporates a novel attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant feature subsets, reducing computational complexity and improving detection accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-Anom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 12.5% with a 3x speedup.
