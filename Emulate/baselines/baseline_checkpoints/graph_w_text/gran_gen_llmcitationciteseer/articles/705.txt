As robots increasingly collaborate with humans in complex tasks, it is essential to develop Explainable AI (XAI) techniques that provide insights into the robot's decision-making process. This paper presents a novel cognitive architecture, 'CogXAI', that integrates XAI with cognitive models of human-robot collaboration. CogXAI uses attention-based neural networks to generate explanations for the robot's actions, which are then validated through user studies. Our results show that CogXAI improves trust and understanding between humans and robots, leading to more effective collaboration in tasks such as assembly and search-and-rescue.
