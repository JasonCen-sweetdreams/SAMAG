Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their ability to understand and respond to diverse user populations is often limited by cultural and linguistic biases. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the impact of cultural and linguistic backgrounds on the effectiveness of voice assistants. We analyze the performance of three popular voice assistants across six languages and six cultural contexts, revealing significant disparities in response accuracy and user satisfaction. We propose a set of design recommendations for more inclusive voice assistants, including culturally sensitive language models, adaptive response generation, and user-centered feedback mechanisms.
