Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of personalized avatars on user experience and behavior in VR environments. We designed and developed an avatar creation system that integrates facial recognition, machine learning-based personality analysis, and real-time animation. Our user study involving 120 participants reveals that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, presence, and enjoyment in VR, particularly among introverted individuals. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR-based applications in education, entertainment, and therapy.
