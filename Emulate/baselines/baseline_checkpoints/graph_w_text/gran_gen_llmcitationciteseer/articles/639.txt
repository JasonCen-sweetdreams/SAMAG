Virtual assistants (VAs) are increasingly prevalent, but their error-prone nature can lead to user frustration. We propose a novel gaze-based error detection mechanism for intelligent VAs, which leverages eye-tracking data to identify potential errors in VA responses. Our approach uses machine learning to classify gaze patterns indicative of user confusion or disagreement, triggering VA-initiated clarification or correction. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates a 35% reduction in errors and a significant improvement in user satisfaction when using our gaze-based error detection system.
