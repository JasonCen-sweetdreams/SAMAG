As relational databases continue to grow in scale and complexity, query optimization remains a critical performance bottleneck. This paper presents a novel distributed query optimization framework, 'DQOpt', which leverages machine learning and graph-based methods to efficiently optimize queries across a cluster of nodes. DQOpt utilizes a hybrid approach that combines statistical modeling with cost-based optimization to minimize query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a large-scale relational database demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
