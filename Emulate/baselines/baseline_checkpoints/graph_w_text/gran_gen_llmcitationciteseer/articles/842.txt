Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents from a massive corpus. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepSparse', which leverages deep sparse representations to encode passages and questions. Our method uses a hierarchical sparse encoder to capture semantic relationships between entities and concepts, enabling efficient similarity computation. Experimental results on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that DeepSparse outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods, achieving a 15% improvement in top-1 accuracy while reducing computational cost by 30%.
