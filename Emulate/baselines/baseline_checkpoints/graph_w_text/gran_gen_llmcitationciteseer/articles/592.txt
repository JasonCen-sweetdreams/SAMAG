Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraphIndex', which leverages the structural properties of data graphs to optimize query execution. We propose a hierarchical indexing scheme that partitions the data graph into smaller subgraphs, enabling efficient query routing and parallel processing. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphIndex achieves up to 3x query performance improvement compared to traditional indexing methods, while reducing storage overhead by 20%.
