Distributed database systems (DDS) are critical for modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query workloads remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize query execution plans in DDS. Our proposed framework, 'QueryOpt', uses a hybrid DRL architecture that combines a graph neural network with a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution strategy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that QueryOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, reducing query latency by up to 35% and improving resource utilization by up to 25%
