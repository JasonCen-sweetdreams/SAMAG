Column-store databases have become increasingly popular for analytical workloads, but their query performance is often bottlenecked by disk-based indexing. This paper proposes an in-memory indexing framework, 'MemAgg', which leverages the memory hierarchy to accelerate real-time aggregation queries. We introduce a novel cache-aware indexing technique that integrates with the database's query optimizer to minimize memory traffic and optimize query plans. Experimental results on a TPC-H benchmark dataset demonstrate that MemAgg achieves up to 5x query performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art disk-based indexing methods.
