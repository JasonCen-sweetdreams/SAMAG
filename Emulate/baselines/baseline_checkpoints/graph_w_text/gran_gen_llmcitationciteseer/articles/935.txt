Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing query processing for RDF graph databases remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn query patterns and optimize query processing. Our approach, called 'RDF-GCN', uses GCNs to learn a compact representation of RDF graphs and then uses this representation to optimize query execution. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that RDF-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
