The increasing adoption of IoT devices and real-time analytics has led to a surge in time-series data storage and querying demands. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing scheme, 'TS-Index', designed for main-memory column-store databases. TS-Index combines a compact, adaptive-bit-width encoding with a hierarchical indexing structure to minimize storage overhead and improve query performance. We also develop an optimized query engine that leverages the index to accelerate range and aggregation queries. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that TS-Index outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 3.5x in storage efficiency and 2.2x in query performance.
