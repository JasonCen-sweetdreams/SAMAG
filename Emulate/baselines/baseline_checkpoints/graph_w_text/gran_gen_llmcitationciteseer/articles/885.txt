Traditional evaluation metrics for search engines, such as precision and recall, often fail to capture the diversity of search results. This paper introduces Rank-Biased Precision (RBP), a novel metric that incorporates both relevance and diversity into a single score. RBP is designed to reward search engines that return diverse results while maintaining high relevance. We conduct an extensive evaluation of RBP on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in promoting diversified search results. Our analysis also reveals that RBP is more robust to query ambiguity and user intent variability compared to traditional metrics.
