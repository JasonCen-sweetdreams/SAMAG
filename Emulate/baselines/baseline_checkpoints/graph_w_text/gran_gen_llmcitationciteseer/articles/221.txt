Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but users often report discomfort and disorientation due to the lack of haptic feedback. This paper presents a study examining the effect of haptic feedback on user experience in VR. We designed a custom VR system with haptic feedback and conducted a user study with 30 participants. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user satisfaction, reduces cybersickness, and enhances spatial awareness. We also found that the type and intensity of haptic feedback influence user experience, with vibrotactile feedback being more effective than electroencephalography-based feedback.
