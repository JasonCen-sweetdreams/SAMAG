Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents an accessible VR interface design framework, 'AccessibleVR', which incorporates assistive technologies and multimodal feedback to enable users with visual impairments to navigate and interact with virtual environments. We evaluate the usability and accessibility of our framework through a user study with visually impaired participants, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
