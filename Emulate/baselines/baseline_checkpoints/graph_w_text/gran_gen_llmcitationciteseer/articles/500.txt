Multi-agent planning has become increasingly important in real-world applications, but scaling to large numbers of agents remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to multi-agent planning using hierarchical task networks (HTNs). Our method, 'MA-Plan', decomposes complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks and assigns them to individual agents based on their capabilities and availability. We introduce a hierarchical planning framework that iteratively refines task assignments and generates executable plans. Experimental results on a suite of benchmark problems demonstrate that MA-Plan outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of scalability, plan quality, and execution time.
