Few-shot relation classification remains a challenging task in natural language processing, particularly when dealing with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages both entity and relation graphs to capture complex semantic relationships. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) entity graph attention, which selectively focuses on relevant entities, and (2) relation graph attention, which models relationships between entities. Experimental results on the FewRel benchmark demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 4.5% on 1-shot and 2.5% on 5-shot settings.
