Individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder affecting articulation and intelligibility, face significant barriers when interacting with voice assistants. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, 'EasySpeak', tailored to the needs of individuals with dysarthria. We conducted participatory design workshops and interviews with individuals with dysarthria, resulting in a set of design recommendations for speech recognition, error correction, and feedback mechanisms. A pilot study with 15 participants demonstrates that EasySpeak significantly improves speech recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
