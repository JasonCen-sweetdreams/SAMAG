The increasing adoption of RDF graphs in various domains has led to a growing need for efficient query optimization techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed RDF graphs. Our method, called 'RL-Query', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal join order and indexing strategy based on the graph structure and query patterns. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that RL-Query outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2x reduction in memory usage.
