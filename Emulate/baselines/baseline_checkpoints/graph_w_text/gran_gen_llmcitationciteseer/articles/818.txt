This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for autonomous agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'AgentQ', where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their individual capabilities and environmental observations. AgentQ utilizes a hierarchical graph neural network to model inter-agent dependencies and a distributed Q-learning algorithm to optimize task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
