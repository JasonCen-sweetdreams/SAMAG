In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to optimize task assignments. Our approach decomposes the task allocation problem into hierarchical sub-problems, enabling agents to learn both high-level task selection policies and low-level action execution strategies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a simulated robotics domain, showing significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional decentralized optimization methods.
