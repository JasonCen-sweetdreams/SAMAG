We propose a decentralized coalition formation framework for task-oriented multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and interests need to form coalitions to accomplish complex tasks. Our approach leverages distributed constraint optimization and machine learning-based negotiation protocols to enable agents to self-organize and form efficient coalitions. We evaluate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead compared to centralized coalition formation methods.
