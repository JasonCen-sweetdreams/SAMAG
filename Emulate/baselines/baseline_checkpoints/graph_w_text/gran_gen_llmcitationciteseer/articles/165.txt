Medical information retrieval (MIR) faces the challenge of efficiently filtering and ranking relevant documents from large collections. We propose a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'MedRank', which leverages domain-specific knowledge graphs and document embeddings to improve retrieval accuracy. MedRank employs a two-stage filtering approach, first pruning irrelevant documents using a coarse-grained neural filter, and then re-ranking the remaining documents using a fine-grained neural ranker. Experimental results on the TREC Medical Retrieval benchmark demonstrate that MedRank outperforms state-of-the-art MIR models in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision.
