Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal ranking performance. This paper proposes a novel context-aware neural ranking model, 'CARMA', which integrates user behavior and query context into the ranking pipeline. CARMA employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively weigh term importance based on user interactions and query intent. Experimental results on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate significant improvements in ranking accuracy and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
