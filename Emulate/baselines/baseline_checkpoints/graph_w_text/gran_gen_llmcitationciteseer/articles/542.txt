Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval results. This paper proposes a novel neural graph-based relevance modeling approach, 'NeuGraph', to enhance query expansion for ad-hoc retrieval. NeuGraph represents the query and document graphs as neural networks, enabling the capture of complex semantic relationships and contextual dependencies. Our experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that NeuGraph outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
