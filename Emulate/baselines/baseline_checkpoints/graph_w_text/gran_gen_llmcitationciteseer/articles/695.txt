Search engines often struggle to provide diverse results, particularly for ambiguous queries. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages adaptive contextualized embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. Our method, 'ACE-Expander', dynamically updates the embedding space based on the search context, enabling more effective identification of relevant and diverse documents. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate significant improvements in search result diversity and relevance, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
