This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to design more intuitive and engaging gestural interfaces. We conducted a user study to investigate how embodied cognition affects user experience and performance in VR-based tasks. Our results show that incorporating embodied cognition principles in VR interfaces leads to improved user satisfaction, reduced cognitive load, and enhanced overall experience. We propose a framework for designing embodied cognition-based VR interfaces and discuss the implications for HCI research and applications.
