Query expansion (QE) is a vital technique for improving the effectiveness of ad-hoc retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel QE approach that leverages deep semantic role labeling (SRL) to disambiguate query terms and identify salient entities. Our method, called SRL-QE, utilizes a pre-trained language model to generate contextualized representations of query terms, which are then fed into an SRL model to extract semantic roles. We demonstrate that SRL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
