Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by limitations in speech recognition, language comprehension, and cognitive load. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction framework for inclusive voice assistants, incorporating visual and tactile cues to facilitate understanding and reduce user frustration. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, demonstrating improved task completion rates and user satisfaction with our approach compared to traditional voice-only interfaces. Our findings inform the design of more accessible and supportive voice assistants for older adults.
