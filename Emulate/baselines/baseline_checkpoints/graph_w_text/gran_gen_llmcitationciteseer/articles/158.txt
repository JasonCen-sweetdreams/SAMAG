Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems to improve the accuracy of document ranking. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural query expansion (HNQE) approach that leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our HNQE model consists of a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures the contextual importance of query terms and a neural ranking module that refines document scores based on the expanded query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
