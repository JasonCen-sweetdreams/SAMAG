As remote collaboration becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the role of embodiment in social presence is crucial. This study investigates how varying levels of embodiment in Virtual Reality (VR) affect user experience and social presence in remote collaboration. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, utilizing a custom-built VR platform with three conditions: (1) low embodiment (text-based chat), (2) moderate embodiment ( avatar-based interaction), and (3) high embodiment (full-body tracking). Results show that higher levels of embodiment significantly enhance social presence, trust, and collaboration quality, but also increase cognitive load and simulator sickness. Our findings inform the design of VR-based remote collaboration systems that balance embodiment, usability, and user experience.
