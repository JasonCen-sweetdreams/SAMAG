Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but existing VR systems often neglect the needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents 'EmpathyBot', an embodied conversational agent (ECA) designed to facilitate inclusive VR experiences. EmpathyBot uses multimodal fusion and machine learning to recognize and respond to users' emotional states, providing personalized support and accommodations. We evaluate EmpathyBot in a user study with participants with disabilities, demonstrating significant improvements in user engagement, comfort, and accessibility.
