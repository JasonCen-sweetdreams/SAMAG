The proliferation of IoT devices has generated vast amounts of sensor data, making anomaly detection a crucial task. Traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering or shallow learning models, which are limited in capturing complex patterns. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for time-series anomaly detection in IoT sensor data. By incorporating both local and global attention mechanisms, HAN learns to selectively focus on relevant features and contextual information, improving detection accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in identifying anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
