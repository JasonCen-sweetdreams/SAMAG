Modern distributed database systems face significant challenges in optimizing complex queries. This paper presents a novel framework, 'DistroOpt', which leverages machine learning and data partitioning to improve query performance. We introduce a probabilistic cost model that accurately estimates query execution times and a novel data placement strategy that minimizes data transfer between nodes. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DistroOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
