Multi-tenant database systems (MTDS) have become increasingly popular for cloud-based applications. However, optimizing query performance in MTDS remains a challenging problem due to the varying resource requirements of different tenants. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, called QOptRL, learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the MTDS environment and receiving rewards based on query execution times. We evaluate QOptRL on a real-world MTDS dataset and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of average query response time.
