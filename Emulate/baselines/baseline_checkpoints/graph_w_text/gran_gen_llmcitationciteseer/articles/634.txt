Conversational search systems aim to engage users in natural language dialogues, but often struggle to accurately re-rank relevant documents. This paper presents a novel approach, 'ConverseRank', which leverages hierarchical neural networks to adaptively re-rank search results based on conversational context. We propose a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes ranking, intent detection, and response generation tasks. Experimental results on a large-scale conversational search dataset demonstrate significant improvement in ranking accuracy and user satisfaction over state-of-the-art methods.
