As augmented reality (AR) technology advances, the need for intuitive and efficient interaction methods becomes increasingly important. This paper explores the use of gaze-based interaction with AR displays, focusing on user experience and performance. We designed and implemented a gaze-tracking system using a commercial eye-tracker and evaluated its accuracy and usability in a controlled study with 30 participants. Our results show that gaze-based interaction significantly reduces task completion time and improves user satisfaction compared to traditional touch-based input methods. Furthermore, we identify key factors influencing user performance, including visual attention, cognitive load, and individual differences in eye movement patterns.
