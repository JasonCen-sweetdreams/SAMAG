Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible conversational interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying key challenges and design recommendations. Our proposed interface, 'CARE', incorporates simplification, visualization, and contextual support to facilitate comprehension and interaction. A usability evaluation with 20 participants showed significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
