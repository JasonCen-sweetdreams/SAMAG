As augmented reality (AR) technology advances, there is a growing need for intuitive and natural interaction methods. This paper presents a gaze-based interaction framework for AR applications, which leverages eye-tracking data to infer user intentions. We conduct a user study to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of our approach, focusing on the correlation between eye movement patterns and user experience. Our results show that gaze-based interaction can significantly reduce user frustration and improve task completion time in AR environments. We also identify key eye movement metrics that can inform the design of future AR interfaces.
