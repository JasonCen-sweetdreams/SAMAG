Column-oriented database systems have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to efficiently process analytical workloads. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages statistical models and machine learning techniques to predict optimal query plans. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that takes into account the columnar storage layout and the query workload characteristics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that ColOpt outperforms existing query optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
