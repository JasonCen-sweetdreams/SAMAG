Virtual reality (VR) interfaces often employ static color schemes, which can lead to user fatigue and decreased immersion. This paper investigates the effects of adaptive color schemes on user experience in VR. We propose a novel method, 'ChromaVR', which dynamically adjusts the color palette based on user behavior, gaze tracking, and environmental lighting conditions. A user study with 30 participants reveals that ChromaVR significantly improves user engagement, reduces visual discomfort, and enhances overall VR experience. Our findings have implications for the design of more user-centered and accessible VR systems.
