Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has been widely adopted in question answering (QA) tasks to capture semantic relationships between entities. However, existing KGE methods often suffer from limited scalability and neglect the hierarchical structure inherent in knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a novel KGE approach, 'HierAttention', which leverages hierarchical attention networks to selectively focus on relevant entities and relations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HierAttention on several QA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results with significant improvements over existing KGE methods.
