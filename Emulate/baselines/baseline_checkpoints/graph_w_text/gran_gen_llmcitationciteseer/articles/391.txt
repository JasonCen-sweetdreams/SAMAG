Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when dealing with novel tasks. This paper proposes a hierarchical meta-learning framework, 'HMET', that leverages task-aware embeddings to adapt to new tasks with limited data. Our approach introduces a novel hierarchical structure that captures task relationships and incorporates a task-agnostic meta-learner to generate task-specific embeddings. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HMET outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image classification, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 5.2% over existing methods.
