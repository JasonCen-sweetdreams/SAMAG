Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'Multi-Scale Temporal Convolutional Networks' (MSTCN), which leverages multi-scale temporal dependencies to identify anomalies. MSTCN uses a hierarchical architecture to capture patterns at different time scales, and a novel loss function that encourages the model to focus on anomaly detection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSTCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and False Positive Rate.
