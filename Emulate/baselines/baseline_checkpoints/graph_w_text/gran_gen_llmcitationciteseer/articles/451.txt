Deep learning models are increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can have devastating consequences in safety-critical applications. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect adversarial attacks using graph attention networks (GATs). By modeling the relationships between input features as a graph, our method leverages GATs to identify suspicious patterns in the input data. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting both white-box and black-box attacks. Our results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art detection methods, achieving a high detection accuracy of 95.2% on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
