Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) often rely on visualizations to convey complex information to learners. However, poorly designed visualizations can lead to cognitive overload, negatively impacting learning outcomes. This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive visualization in ITS, which dynamically adjusts visualization complexity based on real-time learner cognitive load assessment. Our approach leverages machine learning-based cognitive load modeling and real-time visualization adaptation using a cognitive load-aware visual encoding scheme. A user study with 120 participants demonstrates that our approach significantly improves learning outcomes and reduces cognitive load compared to traditional visualization designs.
