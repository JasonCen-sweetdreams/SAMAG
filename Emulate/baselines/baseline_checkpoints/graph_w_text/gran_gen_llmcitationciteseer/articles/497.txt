Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in ad-hoc search tasks, but their performance can be sensitive to the choice of query representation. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of query expansion techniques in improving the retrieval performance of neural models. We propose a novel query expansion framework that leverages both local and global context information to generate expanded queries. Our experiments on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the retrieval performance of state-of-the-art neural models, particularly for difficult queries. We also provide insights into the characteristics of queries that benefit most from query expansion.
