Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is a crucial component of many AI systems, but existing methods struggle to scale to large graphs. We propose a novel KGE approach, HyperKG, which leverages the properties of hyperbolic geometry to efficiently represent complex relationships in knowledge graphs. By exploiting the hierarchical structure of hyperbolic spaces, HyperKG achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while reducing computational costs by up to 70%. We demonstrate the scalability of HyperKG on a massive knowledge graph with millions of entities and relationships, paving the way for its adoption in real-world AI applications.
