This paper presents a distributed multi-agent system for real-time traffic management in smart cities. We propose a novel coordination mechanism based on decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (DEC-POMDPs), which enables autonomous agents to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions and optimize traffic flow. Our approach integrates real-time data from various sources, including sensor networks, traffic cameras, and social media, to improve traffic signal control and reduce congestion. Experimental results using a simulated traffic network demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing travel times and increasing traffic throughput.
