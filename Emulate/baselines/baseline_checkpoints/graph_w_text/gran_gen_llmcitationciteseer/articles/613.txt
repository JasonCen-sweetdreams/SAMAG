In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive solutions. This paper proposes a hybrid auction-based task allocation framework that integrates combinatorial auctions with machine learning-based winner determination. The framework is designed to handle heterogeneous agents with diverse capabilities and preferences, and can effectively allocate tasks in dynamic environments. We evaluate the proposed framework through extensive simulations and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing task allocation strategies in terms of system utility, fairness, and adaptability.
