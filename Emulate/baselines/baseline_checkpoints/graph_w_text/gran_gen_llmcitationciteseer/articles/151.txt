Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of daily life, but individuals with disabilities often face significant barriers to accessing VR technology. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating accessible VR interfaces that cater to users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops and usability studies to identify key accessibility challenges and developed a set of design guidelines and recommendations for inclusive VR interface design. Our results show that incorporating accessibility features into VR interfaces can significantly improve user experience and participation for individuals with disabilities.
