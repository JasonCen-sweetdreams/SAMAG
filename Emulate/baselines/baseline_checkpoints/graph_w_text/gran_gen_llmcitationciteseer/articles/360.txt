Ad-hoc search systems struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to poor query formulations. To address this, we propose a novel hierarchical graph attention model, 'HGA-QR', which refines query representations by modeling relationships between entities, keywords, and context. Our approach leverages graph convolutional networks to learn hierarchical representations of query components and attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant aspects. Experiments on the TREC ad-hoc search benchmark show that HGA-QR outperforms state-of-the-art query reformulation methods, achieving a 12.5% increase in mean average precision.
