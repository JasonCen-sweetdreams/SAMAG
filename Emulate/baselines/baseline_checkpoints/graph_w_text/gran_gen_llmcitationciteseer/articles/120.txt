Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph structural properties and machine learning-based cost estimation to reduce query latency and improve system throughput. We evaluate GraphOpt on a suite of real-world graph datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimizers.
