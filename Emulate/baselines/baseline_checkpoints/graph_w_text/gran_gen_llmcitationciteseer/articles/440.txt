The proliferation of voice-based interfaces (VBIs) has led to a growing interest in personalization techniques that tailor the interaction experience to individual users. This paper presents a comprehensive study investigating the effects of personalization on user experience in VBIs. We designed a controlled experiment with 120 participants, exposing them to either personalized or non-personalized VBI interactions. Our results show that personalization significantly improves user satisfaction, reduces error rates, and enhances overall usability. We also identify key factors influencing personalization effectiveness, including user familiarity with VBIs and individual differences in communication styles.
