Cold start problem in recommendation systems occurs when there is limited user interaction data for new items or users. This paper proposes a novel ranking model adaptation approach, 'CRA', which leverages transfer learning and meta-learning to adapt a pre-trained ranking model to the cold start scenario. CRA learns to extract relevant features from the limited data and adapts the model to the new distribution. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that CRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in addressing the cold start problem, achieving up to 25% improvement in recommendation accuracy.
