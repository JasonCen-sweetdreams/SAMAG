Biomedical information retrieval (BIR) often requires precise query formulation to retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework, 'BioQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate semantically enriched query embeddings. By incorporating domain-specific ontologies and relevance feedback, BioQE significantly improves retrieval performance on benchmark biomedical datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that BioQE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision and a 20% increase in recall.
