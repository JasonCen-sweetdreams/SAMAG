Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems generate vast amounts of time-series data, making real-time anomaly detection crucial for ensuring system reliability and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages graph-structured data and attention mechanisms to identify anomalies in IIoT systems. HGAT consists of a hierarchical encoder that aggregates features from multiple sensors and a graph attention-based decoder that captures complex dependencies between sensors. Experimental results on a real-world IIoT dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in terms of accuracy and latency.
