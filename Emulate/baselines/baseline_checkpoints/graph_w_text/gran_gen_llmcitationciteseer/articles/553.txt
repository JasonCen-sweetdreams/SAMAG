Virtual reality (VR) has transformed human-computer interaction, but the cognitive implications of embodied experiences remain understudied. This paper investigates the relationship between gesture-based interaction and cognitive load in VR. We designed a novel VR platform that tracks users' gestures and measures cognitive load through physiological signals. Our results show that embodied cognition in VR reduces cognitive load for complex tasks, while gesture-based interaction enhances spatial reasoning and memory recall. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more intuitive and effective VR interfaces.
