Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their usability for older adults remains a concern. This study investigates the speech patterns of older adults interacting with voice assistants and identifies common error scenarios. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65-85, analyzing their speech rates, pausality, and error recovery strategies. Our findings inform the design of an inclusive voice assistant prototype, which incorporates adaptive speech recognition, personalized feedback, and error recovery mechanisms. Results show significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction for older adults using our prototype compared to commercial voice assistants.
