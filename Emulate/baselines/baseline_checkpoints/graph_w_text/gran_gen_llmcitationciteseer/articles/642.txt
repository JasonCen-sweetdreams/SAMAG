Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and system scalability. This paper presents an adaptive query optimization framework, 'RL-Optimizer', that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust query plans based on real-time system metrics and query characteristics. Our approach integrates a deep Q-network with a novel reward function that balances query latency, resource utilization, and data freshness. Experimental results on a distributed database benchmark demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving up to 30% reduction in query latency and 25% improvement in system throughput.
