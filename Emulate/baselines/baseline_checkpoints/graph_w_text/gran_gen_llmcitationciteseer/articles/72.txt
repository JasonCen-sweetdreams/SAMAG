This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have different capabilities and task requirements. We propose a decentralized approach based on distributed constraint optimization, which allows agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Our approach is resistant to single-point failures and can handle dynamic changes in the system. We evaluate our approach using a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to centralized allocation methods.
