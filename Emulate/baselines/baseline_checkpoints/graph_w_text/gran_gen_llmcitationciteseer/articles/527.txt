In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that significantly affects overall system performance. This paper proposes a novel adaptive task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in dynamic environments. Our approach, called 'ATA-RL', uses a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn agent-specific task preferences and adapt to changes in agent availability, task priority, and environmental conditions. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate that ATA-RL outperforms traditional rule-based and optimization-based approaches in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and system responsiveness.
