This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). We propose a distributed algorithm that enables agents to learn a joint task allocation policy through local communication and observation of their neighbors' actions. Our approach leverages the expressive power of GNNs to model complex agent interactions and adapt to dynamic task environments. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving near-optimal solutions while maintaining scalability and robustness.
