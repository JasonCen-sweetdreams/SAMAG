Real-time traffic flow prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems, but existing AI models often lack interpretability, hindering trust and reliability. This paper presents 'TrafficLens', a novel framework that integrates scalable explainable AI techniques with graph neural networks for accurate traffic flow prediction. We propose a hierarchical attention mechanism that uncovers relevant spatial-temporal dependencies in traffic data, enabling transparent and interpretable predictions. Experimental results on a large-scale traffic dataset demonstrate that TrafficLens outperforms state-of-the-art models while providing meaningful explanations for its predictions.
