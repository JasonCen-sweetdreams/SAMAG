Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, but traditional QE methods often struggle to capture nuanced semantic relationships between words. This paper proposes a novel QE approach that leverages deep contextualized word embeddings (CWE) to better model word meanings in context. Our method, CWE-QE, integrates CWE into a neural ranking model, allowing the system to adaptively expand queries based on the semantic relationships between words. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that CWE-QE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, particularly for ambiguous and rare query terms.
