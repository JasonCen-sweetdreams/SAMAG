Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but traditional methods often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem. This paper proposes a novel context-aware embedding approach, CAQE, which leverages lexical and semantic relationships to generate expanded queries. CAQE incorporates a graph-based attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies between query terms and documents, resulting in more accurate and diverse expanded queries. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with an average increase of 12.5% in mean average precision.
