Cognitive load detection is crucial for adaptive user interfaces that aim to optimize user performance and experience. This paper proposes a novel approach using eye-gaze features and deep learning to detect cognitive load in real-time. Our approach leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from eye-gaze data and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the temporal dynamics of cognitive load. We evaluate our approach on a dataset of 30 participants performing a complex problem-solving task and demonstrate an accuracy of 92.5% in detecting cognitive load. The results have implications for the design of adaptive interfaces that can adjust their complexity and feedback to match the user's cognitive abilities.
