Autonomous traffic control systems require efficient coordination among multiple agents to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. This paper presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for coordinating multi-agent systems in autonomous traffic control. Our approach consists of two levels: a high-level coordinator that learns to allocate tasks to agents, and low-level agents that learn to execute tasks using deep reinforcement learning. We evaluate our framework in a simulated traffic scenario and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of traffic throughput and reduction in travel time.
