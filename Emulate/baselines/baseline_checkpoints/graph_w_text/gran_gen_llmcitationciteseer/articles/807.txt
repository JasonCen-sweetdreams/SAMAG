With the rapid growth of digital documents, efficient and effective retrieval has become a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to document retrieval using hierarchical document embeddings (HDE). HDE leverages the hierarchical structure of documents to learn a dense representation, enabling fast and accurate retrieval in large-scale document collections. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, while requiring significantly less computational resources.
