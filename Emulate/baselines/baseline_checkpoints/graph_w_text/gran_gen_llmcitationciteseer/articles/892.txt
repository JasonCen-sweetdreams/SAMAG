This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in heterogeneous autonomous agent teams, where agents possess different capabilities and expertise. We propose a decentralized algorithm, 'Distributed Coalition Formation' (DCF), which leverages local communication and negotiation to form coalitions of agents that can effectively accomplish complex tasks. Our approach exploits agent heterogeneity to improve task allocation efficiency and adaptability in dynamic environments. Experimental results in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that DCF outperforms existing centralized and decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
