Real-time analytics on large-scale datasets necessitate low-latency and high-throughput processing. Modern main-memory database systems (MMDBs) offer promising solutions, but their transactional support remains a bottleneck. This paper presents 'RTTx', a novel transactional framework for MMDBs that leverages adaptive concurrency control and speculative execution to minimize latency and abort rates. Our evaluation on a real-world financial dataset demonstrates that RTTx outperforms state-of-the-art MMDB systems by up to 3x in transactional throughput while maintaining strong consistency and durability guarantees.
