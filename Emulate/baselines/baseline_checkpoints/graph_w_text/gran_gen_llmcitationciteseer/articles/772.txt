Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has been shown to be highly effective in open-domain question answering. However, its computational cost remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Query Embeddings (HQE), which leverages the hierarchical structure of question representations to accelerate DPR. By decomposing query embeddings into coarse and fine-grained components, HQE enables efficient indexing and retrieval of relevant passages. Experiments on popular QA benchmarks demonstrate that HQE achieves significant speedups (up to 5x) while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy to state-of-the-art DPR models.
