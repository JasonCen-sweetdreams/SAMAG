As Virtual Reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the effects of personalization on user experience is crucial. This study investigates how personalized VR environments, tailored to individual users' preferences and behaviors, influence user engagement, satisfaction, and cognitive workload. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 120 participants, analyzing quantitative metrics (e.g., task completion time, user ratings) and qualitative feedback (e.g., think-aloud protocols, post-experiment interviews). Our results show that personalized VR environments lead to significant improvements in user experience, particularly for users with prior VR experience. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR system design and provide recommendations for future research.
