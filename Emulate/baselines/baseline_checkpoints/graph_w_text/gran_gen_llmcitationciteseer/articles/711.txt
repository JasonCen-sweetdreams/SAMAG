Node classification in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is a challenging task due to the complexity of node relationships and diverse node types. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that leverages both local and global graph structures to improve node classification performance. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges at different levels of abstraction, enabling the model to capture complex node relationships and contextual dependencies. Experimental results on several real-world HIN datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in achieving state-of-the-art node classification performance.
