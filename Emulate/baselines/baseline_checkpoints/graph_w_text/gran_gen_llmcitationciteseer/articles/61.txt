Coordinating heterogeneous agents in complex environments is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a novel asynchronous distributed reinforcement learning framework, 'ADRL-Het', that enables agents with different capabilities and goals to learn coordinated policies. We introduce a decentralized, asynchronous update mechanism that allows agents to learn from their local experiences while adapting to the changing behaviors of other agents. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that ADRL-Het outperforms existing methods in terms of coordination, scalability, and robustness to agent failures.
