Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents an empirical study examining the impact of dialogue flow and cognition on the usability of conversational systems for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, exploring the effects of varying dialogue structures and cognitive load on task completion rates, user satisfaction, and mental workload. Our results highlight the importance of designing conversational interfaces that accommodate age-related cognitive changes, and provide guidelines for improving the accessibility and inclusivity of these systems.
