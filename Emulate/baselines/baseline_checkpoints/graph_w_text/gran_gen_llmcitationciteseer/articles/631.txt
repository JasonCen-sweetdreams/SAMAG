Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale network data. However, optimizing query performance for real-time analytics on distributed graph databases remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'GraphOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages graph structural properties and statistical models to predict query execution times. GraphOpt utilizes a cost-based optimization approach, incorporating distributed query planning and adaptive result caching to minimize query latency. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt reduces query execution times by up to 5x compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.
