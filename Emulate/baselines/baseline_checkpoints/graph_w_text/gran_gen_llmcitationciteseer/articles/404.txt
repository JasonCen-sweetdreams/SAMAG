This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user engagement in virtual reality (VR) based learning environments. We designed and implemented a VR-based educational platform that utilizes machine learning-driven avatar personalization. Our user study involved 100 participants who interacted with either a personalized or non-personalized avatar in a VR learning scenario. Results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars demonstrated higher levels of engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention compared to those who interacted with non-personalized avatars. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based learning systems and highlight the potential of personalized avatars in improving learning outcomes.
