Domain-specific search engines often struggle to provide relevant results due to the limited scope of their indexed data. This paper proposes a novel diversified query expansion approach, 'DQE-DS', which incorporates both semantic and syntactic features to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our approach leverages a combination of word embeddings, named entity recognition, and part-of-speech tagging to identify context-specific keywords. Experimental results on a dataset of domain-specific searches demonstrate that DQE-DS outperforms existing query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval effectiveness and diversity of search results.
