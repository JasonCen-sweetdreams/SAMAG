Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel context-aware embedding approach, 'CAQE', that leverages both semantic and syntactic features to generate high-quality expansion terms. By incorporating contextual information from the query and document collection, CAQE can capture nuanced relationships between terms and improve retrieval performance. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly in scenarios where the original query is ambiguous or underspecified.
