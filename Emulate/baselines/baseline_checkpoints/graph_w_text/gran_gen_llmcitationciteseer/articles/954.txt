Large-scale document retrieval systems often suffer from vocabulary mismatch between queries and documents, leading to poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural query expansion approach, HierNet, which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively expand query terms based on their semantic importance. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierNet achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods. Furthermore, we show that HierNet can be effectively integrated with existing retrieval models, leading to further performance gains.
