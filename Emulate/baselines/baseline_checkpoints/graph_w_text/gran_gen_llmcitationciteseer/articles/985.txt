Industrial IoT systems generate vast amounts of sensor data, making anomaly detection a critical task for ensuring operational reliability. This paper presents a novel graph-based deep learning approach, 'GraphAD', which leverages the inherent graph structure of IoT sensor networks to identify anomalies more efficiently. GraphAD combines graph attention layers with a contrastive learning objective to learn robust representations of normal sensor behavior, enabling accurate detection of anomalies. Experimental results on a real-world industrial dataset demonstrate that GraphAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
