As robots increasingly interact with humans in shared workspaces, there is a growing need for efficient and safe collaboration strategies. This paper presents a novel attention-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'Attn-MARL', which enables real-time human-robot collaboration in complex tasks. By incorporating attention mechanisms to model human-robot interactions, our approach improves the efficiency and adaptability of collaboration policies. Experimental results on a robotic assembly task demonstrate that Attn-MARL outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time and human satisfaction.
