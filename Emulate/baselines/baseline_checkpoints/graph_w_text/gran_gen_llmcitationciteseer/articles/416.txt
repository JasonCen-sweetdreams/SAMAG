Real-time traffic optimization is a complex problem that requires coordinating the actions of multiple agents in a dynamic environment. This paper proposes a novel scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'SMART', which leverages decentralized learning and graph neural networks to optimize traffic signal control in real-time. We evaluate SMART on a large-scale traffic simulation platform and demonstrate significant improvements in traffic flow and reduced congestion times compared to traditional optimization methods.
