Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are critical for handling large-scale data queries. However, existing DIR systems suffer from high query latency and poor efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, called HiDir, which leverages the principles of distributed hash tables and peer-to-peer networks to enable efficient query routing and document retrieval. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that HiDir reduces query latency by up to 40% and improves query throughput by up to 25% compared to state-of-the-art DIR systems.
