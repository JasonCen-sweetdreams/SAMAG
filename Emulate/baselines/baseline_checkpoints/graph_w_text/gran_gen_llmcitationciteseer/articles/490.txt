Graph pattern matching is a fundamental problem in graph databases, with applications in social network analysis, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs. However, as graph sizes continue to grow, existing indexing techniques struggle to provide efficient query performance. This paper presents 'GraphSprint', a novel indexing framework that leverages a combination of graph summarization, hierarchical indexing, and caching to accelerate graph pattern matching. Our experiments on large-scale graph datasets demonstrate that GraphSprint outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 5x in query response time while maintaining a competitive storage footprint.
