This study investigates the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in alleviating cognitive load for elderly users when interacting with complex digital systems. We designed an ECA-based interface for a medication reminder system and evaluated its effectiveness through a user study with 30 elderly participants. Our results show that the ECA-based interface significantly reduced cognitive load, improved user experience, and enhanced task performance compared to a traditional text-based interface. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of accessible and user-centered HCI systems for older adults.
