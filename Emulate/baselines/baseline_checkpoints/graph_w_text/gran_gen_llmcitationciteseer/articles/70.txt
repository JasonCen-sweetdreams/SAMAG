As voice assistants become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their accessibility for older adults is crucial. This study examines the impact of various accessibility features on the usability of voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, evaluating the effectiveness of features such as speech rate adjustment, audio cues, and personalized vocabulary. Our results show that participants with accessibility features experienced significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction. We provide design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants and highlight areas for future research.
