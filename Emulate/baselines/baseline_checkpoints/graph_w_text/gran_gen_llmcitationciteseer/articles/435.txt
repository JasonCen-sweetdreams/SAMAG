In this paper, we propose a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for multi-agent systems using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Our method, called DAGAT, leverages the graph structure of the agent communication network to learn efficient task allocation policies. We formulate the task allocation problem as a graph optimization problem and use GCNs to learn a decentralized policy that minimizes the total latency and improves the overall system throughput. Experimental results on a simulated multi-agent system demonstrate that DAGAT outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods, achieving an average latency reduction of 23% and a 17% increase in system throughput.
