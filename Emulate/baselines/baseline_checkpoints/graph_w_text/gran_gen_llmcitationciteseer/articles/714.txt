This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our proposed method, 'AdaTA', allows agents to learn task allocation policies through self-play and adapt to changing task requirements and agent capabilities. We evaluate AdaTA in a simulated environment and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion efficiency and agent utilization compared to traditional manual allocation and decentralized greedy approaches. The results have implications for real-world applications such as autonomous warehouse management and disaster response.
