Multi-agent systems often involve autonomous agents negotiating with each other to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. This paper explores the application of deep reinforcement learning to develop negotiation strategies for autonomous agents. We propose a novel framework, 'DeepNegotiate', which utilizes a deep Q-network to learn effective negotiation policies. Experimental results demonstrate that DeepNegotiate outperforms traditional negotiation strategies in various scenarios, including auctions and bilateral negotiations. We also analyze the robustness of our approach against different opponent types and negotiation protocols.
