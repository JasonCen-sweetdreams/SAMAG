Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR. We propose a novel framework that leverages machine learning-based facial recognition and 3D modeling to generate personalized avatars that reflect users' physical appearance and personality traits. Our user study involving 100 participants reveals that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, improved self-presence, and enhanced overall VR experience. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems and applications.
