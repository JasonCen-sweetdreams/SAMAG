Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a complex task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution times. Our approach, called 'RL-QO', uses a combination of exploration-exploitation strategies to adapt to changing database workloads and optimize query performance. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that RL-QO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
