Data profiling is a crucial step in data integration and data quality assessment. However, existing profiling techniques are often limited to centralized databases, neglecting the complexities of distributed database systems. This paper presents 'D-Profiler', a novel, holistic data profiling framework designed for distributed databases. D-Profiler leverages a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify correlated data fragments across nodes, and applies a probabilistic estimation approach to efficiently compute statistical summaries. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate that D-Profiler outperforms state-of-the-art profiling methods in terms of accuracy and scalability.
