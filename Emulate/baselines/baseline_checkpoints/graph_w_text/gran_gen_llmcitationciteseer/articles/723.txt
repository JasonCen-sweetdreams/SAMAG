Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing queries for multi-dimensional data in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization, called 'Distributed Cube', which leverages the concept of data cubing to efficiently process range queries. We develop a probabilistic cost model that accurately estimates the cost of query execution and propose a heuristic-based optimization algorithm that minimizes the total query response time. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
