Real-world multi-agent systems often exhibit complex relationships and interactions. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework for explainable multi-agent reasoning. HGAT leverages hierarchical graph attention mechanisms to capture agent relationships at multiple scales, enabling the model to reason about both local and global interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in a real-world traffic scenario, showing significant improvements in prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to existing methods. Our approach has potential applications in various domains, including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and social network analysis.
