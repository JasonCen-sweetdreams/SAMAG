Virtual learning environments (VLEs) have become increasingly popular, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized feedback on user engagement in VLEs. We designed and implemented a novel feedback system that incorporates machine learning-based user modeling and adaptive difficulty adjustment. Our user study with 120 participants shows that personalized feedback significantly improves user engagement, as measured by time spent on tasks, self-reported motivation, and objective performance metrics. We also identify key factors influencing the effectiveness of personalized feedback, including user personality traits and prior experience with VLEs.
