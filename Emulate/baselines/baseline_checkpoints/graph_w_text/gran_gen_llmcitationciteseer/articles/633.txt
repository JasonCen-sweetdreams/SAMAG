In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a distributed task allocation framework, 'RL-Allocator', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments for autonomous agents. We model the task allocation problem as a Markov decision process and employ a decentralized, actor-critic architecture to learn agent-specific policies. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that RL-Allocator outperforms traditional, centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent satisfaction.
