Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults, but existing interfaces often neglect their unique needs and abilities. This paper presents a novel, accessibility-focused VR interface design framework tailored to older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 older adults, combining user testing, surveys, and interviews to inform our design. The resulting framework emphasizes simplicity, intuitive navigation, and multimodal feedback. A prototype implementation of the framework was evaluated in a controlled experiment, demonstrating significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to a baseline VR interface.
