Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a given question. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) architecture, 'PassageNet', for efficient passage retrieval. PassageNet represents the corpus as a hierarchical graph, where each node corresponds to a passage, and edges capture semantic relationships between them. We develop a neural ranking model that learns to traverse the graph, identifying the most relevant passages for a given question. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that PassageNet outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods, achieving a 12% improvement in passage retrieval accuracy while reducing computational cost by 30%.
