Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem in distributed artificial intelligence. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework that leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex interactions between agents. HGAT enables agents to learn hierarchical representations of their local neighborhoods, facilitating more effective coordination and decision-making. We evaluate HGAT on several multi-agent benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements in coordination efficiency and task performance compared to existing approaches.
