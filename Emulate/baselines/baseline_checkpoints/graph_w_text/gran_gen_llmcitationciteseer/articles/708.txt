Ranked retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various Information Retrieval (IR) tasks. However, their computational cost and memory requirements can be prohibitive for large-scale document collections. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HiRank', which leverages a multi-resolution document representation to reduce the number of neural network evaluations. Our approach combines a coarse-grained ranking stage with a fine-grained re-ranking stage, resulting in significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on the TREC Deep Learning Track dataset demonstrate the efficacy of HiRank in terms of precision, recall, and query processing time.
