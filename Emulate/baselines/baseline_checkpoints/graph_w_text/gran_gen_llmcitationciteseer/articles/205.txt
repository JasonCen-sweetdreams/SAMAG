Distributed systems often suffer from inefficient resource allocation, leading to underutilization and decreased performance. This paper presents an autonomous agent-based framework, 'ARA', that dynamically allocates resources to tasks based on real-time system conditions. Our approach leverages multi-agent systems theory to model interactions between tasks, resources, and agents, enabling decentralized decision-making and adaptability to changing system states. Experimental results on a cloud-based testbed demonstrate that ARA achieves significant improvements in resource utilization, task completion time, and system scalability compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
