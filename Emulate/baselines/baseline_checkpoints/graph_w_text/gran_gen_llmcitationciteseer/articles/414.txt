Virtual reality (VR) technology holds great promise for individuals with disabilities, but existing VR interfaces often fail to account for diverse user needs and preferences. This paper presents a novel approach to eliciting user preferences for personalized accessibility in VR, leveraging a mixed-methods design that combines user surveys, think-aloud protocols, and statistical modeling. Our results identify key factors influencing user preferences for accessibility features in VR, including visual, auditory, and motor impairments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving user experience and accessibility in a VR-based educational application.
