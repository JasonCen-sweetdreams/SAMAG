Conversational agents have become increasingly prevalent in various aspects of life, but their accessibility for visually impaired users remains a significant concern. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible conversational agents that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. Our approach integrates multimodal interaction techniques, including voice, tactile, and gesture-based inputs, to facilitate seamless communication. We evaluate our framework through a user study with 20 visually impaired participants, demonstrating improved usability and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational agents. Our findings provide valuable insights for designing inclusive conversational agents that can be effectively used by visually impaired users.
