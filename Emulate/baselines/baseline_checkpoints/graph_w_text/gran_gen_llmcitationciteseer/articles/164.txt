Time series classification (TSC) is a ubiquitous problem in many applications, but it often suffers from the scarcity of labeled data. Few-shot learning (FSL) has shown promise in addressing this challenge, but existing methods are typically designed for image or text data. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach, MetaTSC, which adapts to new TSC tasks with only a few labeled examples. We introduce a task-agnostic metric learning module that captures the underlying patterns in time series data, and a task-specific adaptation module that fine-tunes the model for each new task. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaTSC in achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal labeled data.
