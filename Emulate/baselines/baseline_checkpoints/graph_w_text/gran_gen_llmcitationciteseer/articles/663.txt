Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for explainable time series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages a multi-scale attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant segments and features, providing insights into the anomaly detection process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while offering improved interpretability and robustness to noise and concept drift.
