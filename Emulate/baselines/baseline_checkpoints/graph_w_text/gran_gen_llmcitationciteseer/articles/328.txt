Patent retrieval is a critical task in intellectual property search, where query expansion (QE) is a key technique to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel QE approach that leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms and patents. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weighs the importance of different terms in the query, and incorporate a patent-specific embedding space to better capture domain knowledge. Experimental results on a large patent corpus demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms traditional QE methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in patent retrieval.
