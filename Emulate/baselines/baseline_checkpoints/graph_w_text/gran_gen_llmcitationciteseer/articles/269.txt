Distributed information retrieval systems face significant challenges in efficiently processing complex queries. This paper presents a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'Distributed Hierarchical Indexing' (DHI), which leverages the concept of multi-level indexing to reduce query latency. DHI employs a two-tier indexing structure, comprising a global index and local indices, to facilitate efficient query routing and processing. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed testbed demonstrate that DHI achieves an average query latency reduction of 35% compared to existing indexing methods, while maintaining comparable retrieval effectiveness.
