Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on handcrafted features and heuristics. This paper explores the application of deep neural networks to learn query expansion models from large-scale datasets. We propose a novel architecture, 'QNCE', which integrates query and document representations using a neural cross-encoder. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain. We also analyze the learned query expansion strategies and demonstrate their interpretability.
