Zero-shot image classification (ZSIC) aims to recognize unseen classes without any labeled examples. Existing approaches rely on fixed, pre-defined class embeddings or complex generative models. We propose Hierarchical Contrastive Learning (HCL), a novel framework that learns a hierarchical representation space for ZSIC. HCL leverages contrastive learning to align seen and unseen class embeddings, and introduces a hierarchical clustering module to adaptively group semantically similar classes. Our experiments on the ImageNet-21K and COCO datasets demonstrate that HCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ZSIC, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness.
