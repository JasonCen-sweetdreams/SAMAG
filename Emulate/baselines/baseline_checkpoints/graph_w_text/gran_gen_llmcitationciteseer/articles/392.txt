In multi-agent systems, effective task allocation is crucial for achieving global goals. However, agents' communication strategies significantly impact the allocation efficiency. This paper proposes a novel context-aware communication framework, 'CACOM', which adapts to the dynamic environment and agent capabilities. CACOM integrates a probabilistic task modeling approach with a reinforcement learning-based communication strategy, enabling agents to selectively share information and reduce unnecessary communication overhead. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that CACOM outperforms existing communication strategies, resulting in faster task completion and improved system resilience.
