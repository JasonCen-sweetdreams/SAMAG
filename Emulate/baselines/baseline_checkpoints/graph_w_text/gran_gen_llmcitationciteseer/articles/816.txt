This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities need to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel distributed constraint optimization approach that enables agents to coordinate their actions and allocate tasks efficiently. Our method, called Distributed Constraint-based Task Allocation (DCTA), leverages local search and constraint propagation to find a feasible task assignment that satisfies individual agent constraints and global system objectives. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DCTA outperforms existing approaches in terms of task completion rate, latency, and overall system utility.
