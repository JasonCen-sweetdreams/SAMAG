Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved impressive results in various domains, but its brittleness to environment changes and interventions remains a significant concern. This paper introduces a novel causal graph-based approach, 'CausalIntervene', which integrates causal graph inference and graph-based intervention to improve the robustness of DRL policies. We demonstrate that CausalIntervene can effectively identify and intervene on causal factors affecting the environment, leading to more robust policy performance under changes and interventions. Experimental results on several benchmarks show that CausalIntervene outperforms state-of-the-art DRL methods in terms of robustness and adaptability.
