Query optimization is a critical component of modern database systems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to accelerate query optimization for main-memory databases. Our framework, 'LIX', integrates a neural network-based index optimizer with a traditional query optimizer, enabling faster and more efficient query execution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that LIX reduces query optimization time by up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art techniques, while maintaining comparable query performance.
