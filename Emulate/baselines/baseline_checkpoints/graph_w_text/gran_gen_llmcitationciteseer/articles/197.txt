Urban traffic management is a complex problem that requires coordinating multiple agents, such as traffic lights and autonomous vehicles, to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to train a decentralized multi-agent system. We design a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to learn cooperative policies and adapt to changing traffic conditions. Experimental results on a simulated urban traffic network demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional traffic signal control methods, achieving a 25% reduction in travel time and a 30% decrease in congestion.
