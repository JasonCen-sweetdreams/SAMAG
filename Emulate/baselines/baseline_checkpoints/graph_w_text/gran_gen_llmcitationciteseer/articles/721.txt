Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the accuracy of search results. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. We design a multi-layer neural network that learns to generate context-aware query expansions from large-scale datasets. Our approach incorporates a hybrid attention mechanism that captures both semantic and syntactic relationships between query terms and document content. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision and recall.
