Real-time object detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicle systems. However, the computational requirements of state-of-the-art detectors hinder their deployment on resource-constrained embedded platforms. This paper proposes a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework, 'AutoDet', which leverages reinforcement learning to efficiently search for detector architectures that optimize accuracy and latency. We introduce a hierarchical search space that incorporates domain knowledge from computer vision and a novel reward function that balances accuracy and computational cost. Experimental results on the KITTI object detection benchmark demonstrate that AutoDet discovers detectors that achieve superior accuracy to hand-crafted models while meeting real-time latency constraints.
