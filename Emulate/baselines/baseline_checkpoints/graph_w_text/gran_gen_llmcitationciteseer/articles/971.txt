Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing answers. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation (HDR) framework that captures semantic relationships between passages, paragraphs, and documents. Our approach leverages a combination of dense and sparse embeddings, enabling efficient indexing and retrieval of passages. Experimental results on several ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that HDR outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods, achieving a 15% increase in accuracy while reducing computational overhead by 30%.
