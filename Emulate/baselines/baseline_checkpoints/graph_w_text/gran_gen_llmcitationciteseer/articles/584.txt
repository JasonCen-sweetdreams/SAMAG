Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it directly affects the quality of retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel neural embedding-based approach to query expansion, specifically designed for scientific literature retrieval. Our method, NEQE, leverages a combination of word and document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms and expand the query with relevant synonyms and related concepts. Experimental results on the CiteSeerX dataset demonstrate that NEQE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, improving retrieval precision by 15% and recall by 20%.
