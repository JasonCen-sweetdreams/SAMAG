In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive solutions. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework based on adaptive coalition formation. Our approach enables agents to form coalitions dynamically, taking into account their capabilities, task requirements, and environmental constraints. We introduce a decentralized optimization algorithm that leverages local information exchange and negotiation protocols to achieve near-optimal task allocations. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead.
