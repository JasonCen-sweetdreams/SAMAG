In distributed database systems, query optimization is critical to minimize response times and improve system scalability. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, which may not adapt well to dynamic workloads or complex query patterns. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, called 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query optimization, considering factors such as data distribution, network latency, and resource utilization. Experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource efficiency.
