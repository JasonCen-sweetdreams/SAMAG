Code search and retrieval play a crucial role in software development, but existing techniques often struggle to capture the semantic relationships between code snippets. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages hierarchical neural network-based embeddings to model the syntax and semantics of code. Our method, called HiCoDe, learns a hierarchical representation of code snippets by recursively applying a neural network to capture both local and global patterns. Experiments on a large-scale code dataset demonstrate that HiCoDe outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
