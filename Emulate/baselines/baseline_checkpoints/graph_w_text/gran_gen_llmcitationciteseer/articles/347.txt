In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach, called DecGNN, leverages the graph structure of the agents' communication network to learn a distributed task allocation policy. DecGNN is capable of handling complex task dependencies and agent capabilities, and does not require a centralized controller. We evaluate DecGNN on a simulated urban search and rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional decentralized allocation methods.
