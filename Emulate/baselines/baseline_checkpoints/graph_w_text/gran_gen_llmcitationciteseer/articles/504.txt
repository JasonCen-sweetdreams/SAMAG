This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, which leverages self-organizing principles to adapt to dynamic environments. Our approach, called 'SOmA', uses a distributed, auction-based mechanism to allocate tasks to agents, taking into account their capabilities, workload, and communication constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that SOmA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system resilience. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's convergence properties and communication complexity.
