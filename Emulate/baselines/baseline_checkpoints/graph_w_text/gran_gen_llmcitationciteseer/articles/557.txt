Conversational search systems rely heavily on accurate query understanding to provide relevant results. This paper proposes a novel neural semantic parsing approach, 'SemParse', to enhance query reformulation in conversational search. SemParse leverages a graph-based neural network to model the semantic relationships between entities, intent, and context in natural language queries. Our experiments on a large-scale conversational search dataset show that SemParse significantly improves query reformulation accuracy and reduces the need for manual intervention. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of SemParse in improving the overall search experience through a user study.
