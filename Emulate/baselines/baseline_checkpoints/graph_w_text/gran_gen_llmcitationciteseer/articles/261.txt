State-of-the-art neural ranking models for information retrieval (IR) often rely on complex and computationally expensive architectures. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural network (HNN) architecture that leverages query-document interaction to improve ranking performance while reducing computational cost. Our HNN model consists of a query-aware document encoder and a hierarchical interaction module that captures multi-level relationships between query and document terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ranking performance and computational efficiency compared to existing neural ranking models.
