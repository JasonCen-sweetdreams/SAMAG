Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in scenarios with complex dependencies and constraints. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph attention networks (GATs) to model the inter-agent relationships and allocate tasks efficiently. Our method, called GAT-Allocator, uses a hierarchical GAT architecture to learn the importance of each agent's local state and communication with neighbors. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GAT-Allocator outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system utility.
