Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, but its adoption is often hindered by accessibility barriers. This paper presents a novel framework for designing adaptive feedback mechanisms that cater to diverse user needs and abilities in VR environments. We introduce a machine learning-based approach that integrates physiological and behavioral metrics to detect user discomfort, anxiety, or fatigue, and subsequently adjusts the feedback modalities to ensure a more inclusive and comfortable experience. Our user study involving participants with varying abilities demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in enhancing user satisfaction and reducing simulator sickness.
