Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in many applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, existing methods often struggle to handle large-scale datasets and high-dimensional data. This paper proposes a novel graph-based contrastive learning approach, 'GraphCon', which leverages the structural properties of time series data to identify anomalies. By constructing a graph representation of the data and applying contrastive learning, GraphCon can efficiently detect anomalies in massive datasets. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of GraphCon compared to state-of-the-art methods.
