Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in various domains, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatar-based feedback on user engagement in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR system that provided either generic or personalized avatar-based feedback. Our results show that personalized feedback significantly increases user engagement, measured through time spent in the VR environment, self-reported enjoyment, and physiological responses. We also explored the role of user embodiment and presence in mediating the feedback effect.
