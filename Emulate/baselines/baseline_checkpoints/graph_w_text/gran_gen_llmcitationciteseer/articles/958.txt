Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their error handling and recovery mechanisms often fail to accommodate users with disabilities. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the impact of error handling strategies on user experience and accessibility. We developed a novel framework, 'VoiceCare', which integrates proactive error prevention, personalized recovery prompts, and real-time feedback. Our evaluation with 30 participants, including individuals with visual and motor impairments, shows that VoiceCare significantly reduces user frustration and improves task completion rates compared to commercial voice assistants.
