The proliferation of virtual assistants has transformed the way people interact with technology. However, older adults often struggle to adopt these systems due to inadequate accessibility and usability. This paper presents a participatory Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) approach to co-designing AI-powered virtual assistants with older adults. Our methodology involves a series of workshops, interviews, and usability testing sessions with 25 older adults to identify their needs, preferences, and pain points. We develop a set of design guidelines and recommendations for creating more inclusive and supportive virtual assistants, highlighting the importance of transparent AI decision-making, personalized feedback, and multimodal interaction.
