Neural topic models have shown promising results in document ranking tasks, but their computational complexity often limits their applicability to large-scale datasets. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural topic model, 'HiNTM', which leverages a tree-structured architecture to efficiently capture topic hierarchies in documents. Our approach enables fast and accurate document ranking by learning to focus on relevant topics and ignoring irrelevant ones. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiNTM in retrieving relevant documents, outperforming state-of-the-art neural ranking models while reducing computational costs.
