Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important in various applications, including financial analysis and IoT monitoring. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the high volume and velocity of incoming data. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query execution plans in real-time data warehousing. We present a framework that uses a graph neural network to learn the query execution patterns and predict the optimal plan based on the workload characteristics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
