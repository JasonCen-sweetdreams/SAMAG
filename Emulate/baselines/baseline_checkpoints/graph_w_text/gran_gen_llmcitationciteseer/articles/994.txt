In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to coordinate autonomous agents in task allocation. Our method, called 'Agent-Q', uses a decentralized, model-free Q-learning algorithm to enable agents to learn optimal task assignments based on their individual capabilities and environmental dynamics. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate that Agent-Q significantly outperforms traditional, centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
