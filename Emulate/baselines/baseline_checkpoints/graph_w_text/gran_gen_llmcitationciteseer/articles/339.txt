In multi-agent systems, trust between agents is crucial for effective coordination. This paper introduces a novel adaptive trust network (ATN) framework that enables agents to dynamically adjust their trust relationships based on observed behavior and communication patterns. We propose a graph neural network-based approach to model trust propagation and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing cooperation and mitigating the impact of malicious agents. Experimental results on a variety of scenarios show that ATN outperforms existing trust mechanisms in terms of system performance and robustness.
