Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but existing haptic feedback systems often fail to provide a realistic and engaging experience. This paper presents an adaptive haptic feedback framework that leverages machine learning-based user modeling and real-time biomechanical simulation. Our approach dynamically adjusts the feedback intensity, frequency, and texture to individual users' preferences and VR environments, resulting in improved user satisfaction and immersion. We conduct a comprehensive user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our framework and demonstrate its potential applications in VR gaming, education, and therapy.
