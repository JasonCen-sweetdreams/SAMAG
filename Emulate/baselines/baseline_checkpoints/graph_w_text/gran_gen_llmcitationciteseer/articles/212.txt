Graph query optimization is a crucial problem in modern database systems, particularly for large-scale graph databases. This paper introduces GRAphQL, a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize graph query execution plans. GRAphQL uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal join order and indexing strategy for a given query, taking into account the graph structure, data distribution, and query workload. Our experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GRAphQL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of execution time and 2x in terms of memory usage.
