E-commerce search engines often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to poor search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'GraphExpan', which leverages graph-based semantics to better understand user queries. By modeling query terms as nodes in a graph and incorporating semantic relationships, we can identify relevant expansion terms that improve search result relevance. Our experiments on a large e-commerce dataset show that GraphExpan outperforms traditional query expansion methods, resulting in a 15% increase in search result quality and a 20% reduction in search latency.
