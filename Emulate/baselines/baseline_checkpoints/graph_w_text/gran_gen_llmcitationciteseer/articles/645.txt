Traditional row-store databases struggle to efficiently execute conjunctive queries, which are common in data analytics and business intelligence applications. We present a novel optimization framework, 'Conjix', that leverages column stores and indexing to accelerate conjunctive query processing. Conjix employs a cost-based optimization strategy that adaptively selects the most efficient execution plan based on query patterns, data distributions, and system resources. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Conjix outperforms state-of-the-art row-store and column-store databases by up to 5x in query response time and 3x in throughput.
