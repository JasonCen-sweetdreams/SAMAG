Virtual reality (VR) systems have advanced significantly, but the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of haptic feedback on user engagement, spatial awareness, and task performance in VR. We designed a series of experiments using a custom-built VR platform with three haptic feedback conditions: vibration, force feedback, and texture simulation. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user experience, particularly in tasks requiring spatial manipulation and exploration. We also identify key factors influencing the effectiveness of haptic feedback, including individual differences in haptic perception and task complexity.
