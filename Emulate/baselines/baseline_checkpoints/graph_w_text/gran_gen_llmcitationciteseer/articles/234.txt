Query expansion is a crucial component of information retrieval systems, aiming to improve the retrieval accuracy by generating relevant expansion terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, termed 'HierExpan', which leverages hierarchical semantic embeddings to capture the nuanced relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. By modeling the semantic hierarchy of terms using a graph-based neural network, HierExpan generates a set of diverse and relevant expansion terms, leading to significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HierExpan over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
