Traditional retrieval models often rely on sparse vector representations, which can be limited in capturing nuanced semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel query-aware document ranking approach that leverages BERT-based dense retrieval. Our method, 'QADR', jointly learns a dense query encoder and a document encoder, enabling more accurate matching of query-document pairs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QADR on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art sparse retrieval models in terms of recall and precision.
