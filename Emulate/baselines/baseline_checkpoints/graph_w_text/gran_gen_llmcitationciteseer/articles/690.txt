Sentiment analysis is a crucial task in natural language processing, but traditional methods often struggle to handle multi-modal data and provide inadequate explainability. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework that leverages both textual and visual features to perform sentiment analysis. Our approach uses multi-head attention to selectively focus on relevant input modalities and incorporates a gradient-based explanation technique to provide insights into the decision-making process. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and explainability.
