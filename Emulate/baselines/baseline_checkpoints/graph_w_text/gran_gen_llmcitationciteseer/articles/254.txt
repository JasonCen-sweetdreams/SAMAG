Stress detection in virtual reality (VR) environments is crucial for providing personalized experiences. This paper proposes a novel gaze-based stress detection approach using deep learning. We develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) that extracts features from gaze patterns and predicts stress levels. Our approach leverages a large-scale dataset of gaze patterns collected from VR users experiencing stressful and relaxing scenarios. Experimental results show that our approach achieves an accuracy of 87.2% in detecting stress, outperforming traditional machine learning methods. We envision our approach being integrated into VR systems to provide real-time stress monitoring and personalized interventions.
