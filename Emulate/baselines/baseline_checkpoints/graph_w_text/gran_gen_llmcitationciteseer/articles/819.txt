Emotion recognition is a crucial aspect of human-robot interaction, enabling robots to respond empathetically to users. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that integrates multimodal features from speech, text, and facial expressions to recognize emotions in real-time. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers that adaptively weigh feature importance, followed by a hierarchical fusion layer that captures inter-modal relationships. Experimental results on the SEMAINE dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in emotion recognition, achieving an average F1-score of 0.85. We also conduct a user study to validate the effectiveness of our system in a real-world human-robot interaction scenario.
