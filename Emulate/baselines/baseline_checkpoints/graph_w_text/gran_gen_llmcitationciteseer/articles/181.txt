Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in node classification tasks, but often rely on abundant labeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for semi-supervised node classification. HGAT leverages attention mechanisms to selectively aggregate features from neighboring nodes and captures hierarchical graph structures through a recursive attention framework. We evaluate HGAT on several real-world graph datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in node classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised GNNs.
