Real-time data warehousing has become crucial for businesses to make timely decisions. However, optimizing queries for low-latency execution remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize query plans for real-time data warehousing. Our method, called 'DRL-QOpt', uses a DRL agent to learn an optimal query plan policy from a large dataset of query executions. We evaluate DRL-QOpt on a real-world data warehousing benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query latency and system throughput compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
