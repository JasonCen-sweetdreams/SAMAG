As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding user behavior and experience is crucial. This study explores the role of embodied cognition in gesture-based interaction in VR, examining how users' bodily experiences influence their performance and perception. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment, combining behavioral and physiological measures with user surveys, to investigate the impact of embodied cognition on gesture recognition, user satisfaction, and cognitive load. Our results show that participants who were encouraged to adopt an embodied approach to gesture-based interaction demonstrated improved performance, reduced cognitive load, and higher user satisfaction. The findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and effective VR interfaces.
