In this paper, we investigate the application of deep reinforcement learning to task allocation in multi-agent systems. We propose a novel framework, 'MADQN', that leverages a decentralized, actor-critic architecture to learn coordination strategies for allocating tasks to agents. MADQN utilizes a novel attention mechanism to capture the complex dependencies between agents and tasks, and is shown to outperform existing methods in several benchmark scenarios. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep reinforcement learning for scalable, adaptive, and efficient task allocation in real-world multi-agent systems.
