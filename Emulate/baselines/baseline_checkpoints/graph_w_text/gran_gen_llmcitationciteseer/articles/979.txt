Few-shot relation extraction (FSRE) aims to identify relationships between entities in text with limited supervision. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex dependencies between entities and their context. Our approach involves hierarchical graph construction, entity-level attention, and relation-specific attention to infer relationships. Experimental results on standard FSRE benchmarks demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving significant improvements in both few-shot and zero-shot settings.
