Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely on effective document ranking to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. This paper proposes a novel neural query graph (NQG) model that leverages the query-document interaction to improve ranking performance. Our approach represents the query as a graph, which is learned jointly with the document representations to capture complex semantic relationships. We evaluate our NQG model on several TREC benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in ranking accuracy compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models. Furthermore, we analyze the interpretability of our model, showing that the learned query graphs provide meaningful insights into the query-document relationships.
