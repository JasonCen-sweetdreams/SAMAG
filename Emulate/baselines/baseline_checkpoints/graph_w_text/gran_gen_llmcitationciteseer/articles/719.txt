Node classification is a fundamental task in graph analysis, but existing methods often struggle with noisy or incomplete graph structures. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages multi-scale graph representations to improve node classification robustness. Our approach combines node and graph attention mechanisms to adaptively weigh node features and graph structures at different scales. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness to graph perturbations.
