Voice-assisted interfaces (VAIs) have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but the role of personalization in shaping user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study that explores how personalized features in VAIs influence user satisfaction, trust, and behavioral adaptation. Our results show that personalized VAIs can lead to increased user engagement and perceived usefulness, but also raise concerns about privacy and transparency. We identify key design implications for VAI systems that balance personalization with user autonomy and agency.
