Existing gesture recognition systems often neglect the needs of older adults with motor impairments, leading to decreased accessibility and user experience. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive gesture recognition systems, incorporating insights from gerontology, psychology, and human-computer interaction. We develop a set of guidelines for adapting gesture recognition algorithms to accommodate motor impairments, and evaluate our approach through a user study with 20 older adults with varying levels of mobility. Results show significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction, highlighting the potential for more inclusive and supportive interfaces.
