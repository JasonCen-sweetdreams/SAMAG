Time-series data has become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, querying and indexing such data in distributed database systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'TS-Tree', which leverages a combination of spatial and temporal locality to efficiently store and query time-series data. We evaluate TS-Tree on a real-world IoT dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and storage efficiency compared to existing indexing methods. Our approach is highly scalable and can be easily integrated with existing distributed database systems.
