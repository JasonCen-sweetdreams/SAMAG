Conversational search systems rely on passage retrieval to provide relevant answers to user queries. However, the retrieval process often suffers from incomplete or noisy context, leading to suboptimal results. This paper presents a novel query-driven document expansion approach, 'QDE', which selectively incorporates relevant sentences from the top-retrieved documents to augment the original query. We propose a neural ranking model that leverages both local and global context to identify the most informative expansion sentences. Experimental results on the TREC Conversational Assistance Track dataset demonstrate that QDE significantly improves passage retrieval accuracy and relevance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
