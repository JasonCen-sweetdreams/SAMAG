Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained increasing attention in recent years, as they provide transparency into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention graph convolutional network (HAGCN) model that leverages both user-item interactions and item attributes to generate personalized explanations. Our approach utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant user and item features, and a graph convolutional network to capture complex relationships between items. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that HAGCN outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
