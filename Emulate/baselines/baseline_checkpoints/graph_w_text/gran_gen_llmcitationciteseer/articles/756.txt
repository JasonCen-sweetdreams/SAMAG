This paper proposes a novel decentralized planning framework for coordinating multi-agent systems, leveraging graph-based representations to model agent interactions and objectives. Our approach, dubbed 'GraphPlan', enables agents to locally construct and exchange graph-based plans, facilitating efficient and scalable coordination in dynamic environments. We prove the correctness and completeness of GraphPlan and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulated urban traffic management and search-and-rescue scenarios, showcasing improved response times and reduced communication overhead.
