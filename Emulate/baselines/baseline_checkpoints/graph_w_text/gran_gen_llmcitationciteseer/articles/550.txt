Real-time information retrieval (RTIR) systems require efficient document filtering to reduce latency and improve user experience. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural network (HNN) architecture for document filtering, which leverages semantic and syntactic features from documents and queries. Our approach outperforms traditional filtering methods by 23.1% in terms of precision and 17.5% in terms of recall on a benchmark dataset. We also demonstrate the scalability of our approach by evaluating it on a large-scale IR dataset, achieving an average filtering time of 12.6 ms per query.
