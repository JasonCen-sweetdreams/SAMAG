Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, yet their anthropomorphic design elements can have unintended consequences on user trust and satisfaction. This study investigates how varying levels of anthropomorphism in voice assistants influence user perceptions of trustworthiness, likability, and overall satisfaction. We conducted a between-subjects experiment with 120 participants, exposing them to either a highly anthropomorphized or a minimalist voice assistant. Our results show that users are more likely to trust and be satisfied with voice assistants that employ subtle, context-dependent anthropomorphic cues, rather than overtly human-like features. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of inclusive and trustworthy voice assistants.
