Distributed database systems face significant challenges in indexing large datasets across multiple nodes. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, Hierarchical Bloom Filter Indexing (HBFI), which leverages probabilistic data structures to efficiently manage distributed data. HBFI employs a hierarchical approach, combining Bloom filters withskip lists to achieve fast query performance and low memory overhead. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HBFI outperforms existing indexing techniques in terms of query latency and storage efficiency, making it a promising solution for large-scale distributed database systems.
