Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a crucial step in this process, as it aims to reformulate the original query to better capture the user's intent. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, dubbed 'QNexus', which leverages the strengths of neural networks in learning semantic relationships between words. QNexus uses a dual-encoder architecture to learn query and document representations, and then generates an expanded query through a generative process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QNexus outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness.
