Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted co-design workshops with 20 older adults to identify key challenges and preferences. Our findings indicate that existing voice assistants lack intuitive interfaces, clear feedback, and personalized support. We propose a set of design guidelines and a prototype voice assistant, 'ElderAssist', which incorporates these requirements. A user study with 15 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction.
