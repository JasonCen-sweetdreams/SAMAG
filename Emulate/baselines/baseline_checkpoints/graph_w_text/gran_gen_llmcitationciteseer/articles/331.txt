As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent in educational settings, it is essential to investigate factors that influence user engagement. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on learner motivation and self-efficacy in VR-based learning environments. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment involving 120 participants, who interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a VR simulation. Results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars reported higher levels of engagement, enjoyment, and perceived learning gains compared to those using generic avatars. Furthermore, thematic analysis of user feedback revealed that personalized avatars enhanced users' sense of presence and agency in the virtual environment.
