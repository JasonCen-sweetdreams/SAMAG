Multi-tenant database systems (MTDS) have become increasingly popular in cloud-based services, but optimizing query performance across multiple tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize query plans in MTDS. We design a DRL agent that learns to navigate the complex query optimization space, taking into account tenant-specific workload characteristics and system resource constraints. Experimental results on a real-world MTDS benchmark show that our approach achieves an average query latency reduction of 35% compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
