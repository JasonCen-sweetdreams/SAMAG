Cyber-physical systems (CPS) require efficient task allocation to ensure real-time performance and reliability. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for distributed task allocation in CPS. Our approach, called MARL-TA, leverages decentralized decision-making and coordination among agents to optimize task assignment. We introduce a novel reward function that incorporates system-level performance metrics, such as latency and energy consumption. Experimental results on a case study of a smart manufacturing system demonstrate that MARL-TA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of adaptability and scalability.
