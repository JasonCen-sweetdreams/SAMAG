Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component of ad-hoc information retrieval systems, as it aims to refine user queries to better match relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel QE approach leveraging deep neural networks, specifically designed to capture semantic relationships between query terms and document content. Our model, dubbed 'NeuroQE', incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to weight query term importance and a graph convolutional network to model document structure. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art QE methods, particularly for ambiguous and under-specified queries.
