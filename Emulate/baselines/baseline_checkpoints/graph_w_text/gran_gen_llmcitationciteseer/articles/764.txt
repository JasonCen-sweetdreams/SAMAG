As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible interfaces that cater to the diverse needs of older adults, particularly those with motor impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing gestural interfaces that accommodate the physical and cognitive abilities of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements, including adaptable gesture recognition, personalized feedback, and error tolerance. Our evaluation results show that the proposed interface significantly improves the interaction experience and reduces user frustration for older adults with motor impairments.
