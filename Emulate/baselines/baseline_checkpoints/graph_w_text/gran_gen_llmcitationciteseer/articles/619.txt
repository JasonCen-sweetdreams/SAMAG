This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse skills and reliability levels need to collaborate to achieve common goals. We propose a decentralized framework that incorporates adaptive reputation systems to evaluate agent performance and reliability in real-time. Our approach enables agents to dynamically adjust their task assignments based on the reputation scores, leading to improved team efficiency and robustness. Experimental results using simulated disaster response scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing task completion times and enhancing overall system resilience.
