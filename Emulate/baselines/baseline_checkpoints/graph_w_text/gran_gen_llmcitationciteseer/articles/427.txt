This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems using Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning. We introduce a decentralized HTN framework, where each agent maintains a local plan and communicates with neighboring agents to resolve conflicts and achieve global goals. Our approach leverages a hierarchical representation of tasks to reduce the complexity of planning and improve scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional centralized planning approaches in terms of planning time and solution quality, particularly in large-scale multi-agent systems.
