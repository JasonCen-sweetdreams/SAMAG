This paper presents a novel approach to document ranking in information retrieval, leveraging the power of deep neural networks and query reformulation. Our proposed model, DeepRank, incorporates a query reformulation module that generates semantically similar queries to the original query, thereby expanding the search space and improving retrieval accuracy. We also introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weights the importance of different query terms and document segments. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepRank significantly outperforms traditional ranking models and state-of-the-art neural ranking approaches.
