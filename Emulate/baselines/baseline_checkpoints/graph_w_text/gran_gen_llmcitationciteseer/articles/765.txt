This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop accessible gestural interfaces for older adults with dementia. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with caregivers and individuals with dementia to identify key challenges and opportunities in gestural interaction. Our findings inform the design of 'EasyGest', a novel interface that incorporates simplification, consistency, and feedback mechanisms to facilitate intuitive gestural input. A usability evaluation with 15 older adults with dementia demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing gestural interfaces.
