Conversational search systems require efficient ranking models that can effectively leverage context and user feedback. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking framework, 'ConvRank', which integrates multi-task learning to jointly optimize relevance, coherence, and user engagement. We design a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures contextual dependencies and user preferences, while a shared knowledge encoder facilitates knowledge sharing across tasks. Experiments on a large-scale conversational search dataset demonstrate that ConvRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of nDCG, MRR, and user satisfaction metrics.
