Virtual reality (VR) technology has revolutionized various fields, but users often struggle with cognitive and motor skill demands. This paper introduces 'GazeGuide', a novel gaze-based adaptive feedback system that dynamically adjusts VR interactions to individual user needs. Our system utilizes machine learning-based gaze tracking and real-time performance assessment to provide personalized feedback, reducing user frustration and improving overall experience. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates significant gains in task completion speed and user satisfaction when using GazeGuide. The results have implications for VR-based training, education, and entertainment applications.
