Query optimization is a crucial step in achieving efficient query processing in distributed database systems. Existing approaches rely on heuristics, rule-based systems, or statistical models, which may not adapt well to changing workloads and data distributions. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based approach, 'RL-QOPT', that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database system. We design a reward function that balances query execution time, resource utilization, and data freshness. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-QOPT outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
