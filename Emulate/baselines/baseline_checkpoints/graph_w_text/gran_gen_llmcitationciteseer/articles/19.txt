As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible interfaces that accommodate cognitive impairments. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interface framework, 'EasyGesture', designed specifically for older adults with mild cognitive impairments. EasyGesture utilizes machine learning-based gesture recognition and adaptively adjusts its sensitivity and feedback mechanism based on user performance. Our user study with 30 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional interfaces. We discuss the implications of our design principles for future HCI research in accessible interface design.
