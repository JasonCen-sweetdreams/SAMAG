Multi-tenant Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have become increasingly popular, but optimizing queries in these environments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'TenantAware', which leverages tenant-specific workload patterns and resource utilization to minimize query latency and improve overall system efficiency. We propose a hybrid approach that combines traditional query optimization techniques with machine learning-based models to accurately predict query execution times and optimize resource allocation. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate that TenantAware achieves an average query latency reduction of 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
