Individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder characterized by difficulty articulating words, often face significant barriers when interacting with voice-based interfaces. This paper presents a novel approach to designing accessible voice interfaces that accommodates the unique needs of users with dysarthria. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with dysarthria, combining qualitative interviews with quantitative usability testing of a custom-built voice assistant. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive speech recognition, personalized error correction, and multimodal feedback in enhancing the accessibility and user experience of voice interfaces for this population.
