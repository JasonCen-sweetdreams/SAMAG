Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely on effective query representation to retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a ranking-based neural query expansion approach, 'RQE-Net', which leverages a neural ranking model to identify informative terms for query expansion. Our approach involves training a neural network to predict the relevance of each term in the query context, and then using the top-ranked terms to expand the original query. Experimental results on several ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that RQE-Net outperforms existing query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
