Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern computing, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process and train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query plan selection. Our experiments on a real-world database show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
