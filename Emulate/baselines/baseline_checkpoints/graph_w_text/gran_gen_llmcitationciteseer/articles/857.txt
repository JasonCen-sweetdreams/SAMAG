Gaze-based intention detection is a critical component of human-computer interaction (HCI) systems, enabling machines to anticipate and respond to user goals. This paper presents a novel deep learning framework, 'GazeIntentionNet', which leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to detect user intentions from raw gaze data. We collect a large-scale dataset of gaze patterns and corresponding user goals, and demonstrate that GazeIntentionNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in intention detection accuracy. Our system has applications in intelligent tutoring systems, assistive technologies, and human-robot collaboration.
