Query expansion is a crucial component of modern search engines, as it enables users to retrieve relevant documents that may not contain the exact query terms. However, existing expansion techniques often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQEF', which leverages a multi-level representation of query semantics to generate expanded queries. HQEF incorporates a neural topic model to capture latent topics, and a graph-based method to identify semantic relationships between query terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQEF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness.
