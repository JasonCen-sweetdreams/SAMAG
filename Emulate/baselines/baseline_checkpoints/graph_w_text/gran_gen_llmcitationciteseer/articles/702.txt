In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to learn effective assignment strategies. Our approach represents the agent-task interaction as a graph and uses GCNs to incorporate local and global information. We develop a distributed algorithm that enables agents to share knowledge and adapt to dynamic task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
