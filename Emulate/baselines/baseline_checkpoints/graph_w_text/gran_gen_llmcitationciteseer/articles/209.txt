Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem in many applications, including robotics, smart cities, and autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines reinforcement learning with graph attention mechanisms to learn effective coordination strategies. Our method, called Graph Attention-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (GAMARL), represents the agents' communication graph as a neural network and learns to focus on the most relevant agents when making decisions. We evaluate GAMARL on several benchmark problems, including traffic signal control and robotic foraging, and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
