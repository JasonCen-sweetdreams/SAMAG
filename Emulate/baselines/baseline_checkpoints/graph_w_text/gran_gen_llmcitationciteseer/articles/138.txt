Multi-agent dialogue systems require effective dialogue management to generate coherent and context-dependent responses. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent dialogue management. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to select relevant context information and capture complex relationships between agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a real-world customer service scenario, achieving significant improvements in response accuracy and coherence compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our model provides interpretable attention weights, enabling explainability of dialogue flow and decision-making.
