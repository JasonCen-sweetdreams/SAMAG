Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current VR interfaces often neglect the needs of users with visual impairments. This paper presents an inclusive VR interface design framework, VIIDE, which incorporates multimodal feedback and adaptive navigation mechanisms to facilitate independent exploration of virtual environments. We conducted a user study with 20 visually impaired participants, demonstrating significant improvements in navigation efficiency and user satisfaction compared to existing VR interfaces. Our work contributes to the development of more accessible and equitable VR experiences.
