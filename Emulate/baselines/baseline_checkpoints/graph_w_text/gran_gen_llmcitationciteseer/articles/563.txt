Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems require efficient passage retrieval to reduce the search space for answer extraction. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical density-based clustering approach, called 'HDCluster', to index and retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus. HDCluster adaptively groups passages into clusters based on their semantic similarity, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of top-k passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDCluster outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods, achieving a 25% improvement in mean average precision and a 3x speedup in retrieval time.
