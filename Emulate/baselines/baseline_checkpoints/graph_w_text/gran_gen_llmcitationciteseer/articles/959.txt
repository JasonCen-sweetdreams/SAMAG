Query intent identification is a crucial task in information retrieval, as it enables search engines to provide more relevant results. Existing methods rely on annotated datasets, which are time-consuming and expensive to create. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach, HiGAT, which leverages hierarchical graph attention networks to model the complex relationships between query terms and their context. We evaluate HiGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in intent identification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that HiGAT can be easily adapted to different domains and languages, making it a versatile solution for real-world search applications.
