Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc information retrieval, as it directly impacts the relevance and diversity of search results. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for query expansion, which leverages a combination of word embeddings and recurrent neural networks to model query context and semantic relationships. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for ambiguous and underspecified queries, compared to traditional methods. We also investigate the impact of various neural architectures and training objectives on query expansion performance.
