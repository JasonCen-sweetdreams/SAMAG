High-dimensional data indexing is a crucial task in various applications, including data mining and machine learning. This paper proposes a novel indexing method based on hierarchical k-means trees, which reduces the computational cost of similarity searches and improves query performance. Our approach leverages a multi-resolution representation of the data, where each level of the hierarchy corresponds to a different granularity of the k-means clustering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, showcasing significant improvements in query efficiency and accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
