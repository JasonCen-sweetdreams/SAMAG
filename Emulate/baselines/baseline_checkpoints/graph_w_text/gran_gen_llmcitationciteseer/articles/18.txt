Multidimensional indexing is a crucial technique for efficient query processing in modern databases. However, existing indexing methods often struggle with high-dimensional data, leading to poor query performance. This paper proposes a novel GPU-accelerated indexing approach, 'GIDX', which leverages the parallel processing capabilities of modern graphics processing units (GPUs). Our approach uses a hybrid indexing scheme that combines a CPU-based filter with a GPU-accelerated refinement step, achieving significant speedups over traditional indexing methods. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that GIDX outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 5x for high-dimensional range queries.
