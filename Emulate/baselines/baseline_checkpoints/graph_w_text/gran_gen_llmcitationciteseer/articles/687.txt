Distributed database systems (DDS) have become a cornerstone of modern data management, but optimizing query performance remains a complex challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RL-Opt', which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans in DDS. We design an RL agent that learns to select optimal plans by interacting with the database environment and receiving rewards based on query execution times. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving up to 30% reduction in query latency and 25% improvement in throughput.
