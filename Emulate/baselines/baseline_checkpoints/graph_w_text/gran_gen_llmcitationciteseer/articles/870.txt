As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly pervasive, securing AR experiences against unauthorized access is crucial. This paper presents a novel gaze-based authentication system utilizing deep learning techniques. Our approach leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze users' gaze patterns, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing legitimate users from impostors. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in various AR scenarios, highlighting its potential for seamless and secure authentication in AR applications.
