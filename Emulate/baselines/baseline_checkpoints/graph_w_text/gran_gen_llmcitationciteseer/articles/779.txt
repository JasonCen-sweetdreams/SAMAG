This paper presents a novel decentralized agent coordination framework for dynamic task allocation in multi-robot systems. Our approach, called DACTAR, leverages a combination of distributed constraint optimization and machine learning to enable autonomous robots to adaptively allocate tasks in real-time. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized constraint satisfaction problem and propose a neural network-based solver that can be executed on each robot's onboard computer. Experimental results show that DACTAR outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and robustness to robot failures, while also providing improved flexibility and scalability.
