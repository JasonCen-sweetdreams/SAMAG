Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in natural language processing and information retrieval, but existing approaches often struggle with scalability and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach, 'GEDHIC', which leverages hierarchical clustering to efficiently disambiguate entities in large-scale knowledge graphs. By learning graph-based embeddings and incorporating semantic context, GEDHIC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, outperforming traditional machine learning-based methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GEDHIC in a real-world application, improving entity linking accuracy by 23% on a large Wikipedia dataset.
