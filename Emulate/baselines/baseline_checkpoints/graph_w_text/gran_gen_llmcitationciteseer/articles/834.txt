In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism for task allocation, which leverages the concept of virtual currencies to facilitate agent-to-agent negotiations. Our approach, called DTA-MAS, enables agents to bid for tasks based on their capabilities and availability, and allocates tasks to the winning agents. We prove the convergence and optimality of DTA-MAS under various settings and evaluate its performance using simulations, demonstrating improved task allocation efficiency and reduced communication overhead compared to existing centralized approaches.
