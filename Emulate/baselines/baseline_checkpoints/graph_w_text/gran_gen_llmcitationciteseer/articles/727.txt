Session-based recommendation systems aim to predict the next item a user will interact with based on their recent behavior. Graph-based models have shown promise in this task, but they can be limited by their inability to capture complex item relationships and contextual information. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that combines hierarchical graph encoding with attention mechanisms to model both local and global dependencies in user-item interactions. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall, while providing interpretable insights into user behavior.
