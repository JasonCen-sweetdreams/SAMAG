Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-based data analysis, but it often suffers from limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for semi-supervised node classification. HGAT learns to represent nodes at multiple scales by recursively applying graph attention mechanisms, capturing both local and global structural patterns. We also develop a new self-supervised loss function that leverages the node's neighborhood information to regularize the learning process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to noisy labels.
