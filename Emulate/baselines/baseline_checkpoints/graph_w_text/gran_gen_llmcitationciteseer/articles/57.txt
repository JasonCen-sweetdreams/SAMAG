Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by limitations in speech recognition and accessibility. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating an inclusive voice assistant for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, examining the impact of speech recognition errors, cognitive load, and visual feedback on user experience. Our results reveal that older adults prefer a hybrid interaction model that combines voice and visual inputs, and that personalized speech recognition models can significantly improve recognition accuracy. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing more accessible and usable voice assistants.
