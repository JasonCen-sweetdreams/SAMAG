This paper presents a novel gesture recognition system designed to accommodate elderly users with motor impairments. Our system leverages machine learning models to adapt to the unique movement patterns and abilities of individual users, improving recognition accuracy and usability. We conducted a user study with 20 elderly participants and demonstrated a 30% increase in gesture recognition accuracy compared to traditional machine learning approaches. Our system also incorporates real-time feedback mechanisms to facilitate user learning and adjustment, leading to improved user experience and overall system effectiveness.
