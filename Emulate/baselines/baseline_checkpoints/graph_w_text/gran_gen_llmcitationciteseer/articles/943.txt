Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current interfaces often neglect the needs of users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel VR interface design that leverages audio-haptic feedback and gesture recognition to enable users with visual impairments to navigate and interact with virtual environments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that our design significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-based interfaces. Our results inform the development of more inclusive and accessible VR systems.
