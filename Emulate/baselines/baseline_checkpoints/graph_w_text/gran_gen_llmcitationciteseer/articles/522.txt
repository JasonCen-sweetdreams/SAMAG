High-dimensional data indexing is a crucial task in many data-intensive applications, but existing methods suffer from scalability issues and poor performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, 'DeepIndex', which leverages the power of deep neural networks to efficiently index high-dimensional data. By learning a compact representation of the data using a hierarchical neural network, DeepIndex achieves significant improvements in query performance and storage efficiency compared to traditional indexing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepIndex on various real-world datasets, showcasing its potential in accelerating query processing for modern data analytics.
