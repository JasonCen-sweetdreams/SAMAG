Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal query execution plan based on the system's current workload and resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional rule-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
