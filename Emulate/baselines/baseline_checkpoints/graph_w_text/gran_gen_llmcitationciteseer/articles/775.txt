Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems often struggle to accurately capture the nuances of medical queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'MedExpan', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between medical concepts. MedExpan uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn a dense representation of medical queries and expand them with relevant terms. Experimental results on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset show that MedExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, improving retrieval precision by up to 15% and recall by up to 20%.
