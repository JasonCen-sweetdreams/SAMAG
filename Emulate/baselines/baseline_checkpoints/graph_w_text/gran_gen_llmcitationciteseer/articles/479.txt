Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, are increasingly prevalent, but their interfaces often neglect the needs of users with dyslexia. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible conversational interfaces for users with dyslexia. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with dyslexic users, identifying key challenges and preferences. Our proposed design framework, 'DyslexiaAwareCI', incorporates features such as phonetic-based error correction, personalized text summarization, and adaptive font sizes. A usability study with 20 dyslexic participants demonstrates that DyslexiaAwareCI significantly improves conversational interface usability and user experience.
