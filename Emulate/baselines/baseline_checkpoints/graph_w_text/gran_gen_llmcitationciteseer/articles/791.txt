Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but the impact of avatar customization on user experience remains understudied. This paper investigates how customizing avatars affects user engagement, presence, and cognitive load in VR. We conducted a user study with 60 participants, who completed tasks in a VR environment with either a default or customized avatar. Our results show that customization significantly enhances user experience, particularly for females and gamers. We also found that customization reduces cognitive load, allowing users to focus on the task at hand. Our findings have implications for VR application designers and provide insights into the role of avatar customization in shaping user experience.
