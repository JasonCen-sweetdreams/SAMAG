The increasing availability of trajectory data from various sources such as GPS, mobile devices, and sensors has created new opportunities for transportation and urban planning applications. However, indexing and querying trajectory data in road networks remain challenging due to their complex spatial and temporal relationships. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, TrajR-Tree, which leverages the road network topology to efficiently store and retrieve trajectory data. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TrajR-Tree outperforms existing indexing methods in terms of query performance and storage efficiency.
