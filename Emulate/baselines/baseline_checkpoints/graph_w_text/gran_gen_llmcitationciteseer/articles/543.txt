Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. Existing methods often struggle with complex temporal dependencies and non-linear relationships. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach, 'GTAD', which leverages attention mechanisms to identify anomalies in time-series data. GTAD represents time-series data as graphs, enabling the capture of intricate relationships between data points. Our attention mechanism adaptively focuses on the most informative nodes, reducing false positives and improving detection accuracy. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate GTAD's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 12.5%.
