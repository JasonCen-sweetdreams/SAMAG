Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in enhancing user experience in VR. We present 'VR-Chatty', a novel ECA framework that leverages multimodal sensing and machine learning to recognize and respond to user emotions, gestures, and voice commands. Our user study (N=60) demonstrates that VR-Chatty significantly increases user engagement, sense of presence, and overall satisfaction in VR applications compared to traditional text-based interfaces.
