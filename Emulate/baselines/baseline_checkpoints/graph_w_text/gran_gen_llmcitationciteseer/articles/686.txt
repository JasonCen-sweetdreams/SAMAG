Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of people with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces, focusing on individuals with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies, leading to the development of a novel framework that incorporates accessibility features, such as multimodal input, output customization, and real-time feedback. Our evaluation shows that the proposed framework significantly improves the interaction experience and satisfaction of users with disabilities, while also enhancing overall system usability.
