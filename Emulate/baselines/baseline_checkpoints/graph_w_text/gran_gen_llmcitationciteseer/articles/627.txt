Distributed database systems face significant challenges in optimizing query execution plans. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based systems, which often fail to adapt to dynamic workloads and complex query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. We design a customized reinforcement learning framework that incorporates query semantics, system workload, and resource utilization to optimize query plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
