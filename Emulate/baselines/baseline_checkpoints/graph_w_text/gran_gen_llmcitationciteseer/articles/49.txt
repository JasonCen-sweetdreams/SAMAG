Multi-agent systems often require efficient task allocation to achieve common goals. We present a novel decentralized approach that leverages distributed constraint satisfaction (DisCSP) to allocate tasks in a flexible and scalable manner. Our algorithm, called D-MAP, enables agents to locally solve constraint satisfaction problems, reducing communication overhead and improving overall system performance. Experimental evaluations on a variety of multi-agent domains demonstrate that D-MAP outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods, achieving up to 30% improvement in task completion rate and 25% reduction in communication costs.
