Distributed databases have become ubiquitous in modern data management, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to select optimal query plans based on runtime statistics and database state. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
