Designing scalable recommendation systems that can handle large user-item graphs is a critical challenge in modern e-commerce. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global graph structures to generate personalized recommendations. Our approach employs a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively selects relevant user and item features at multiple scales, enabling efficient processing of large graphs. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability.
