Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance accessibility for individuals with motor impairments. However, current systems often fail to account for the diverse range of abilities and needs within this population. This paper presents a novel, inclusive gesture recognition framework that leverages machine learning and participatory design principles. We conducted a co-design study with 20 participants with motor impairments, resulting in a set of design recommendations for gesture recognition systems that prioritize flexibility, adaptability, and personalization. Our system, ' GestureFlex', is evaluated through a user study, demonstrating improved recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
