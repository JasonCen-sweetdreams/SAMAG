In-memory database systems have gained popularity due to their high performance and low latency. However, they often lack robust support for concurrent transactions, leading to inconsistencies and performance degradation. This paper proposes a novel concurrency control protocol, 'TransAct', designed for distributed in-memory database systems. TransAct leverages a combination of optimistic concurrency control and multiversion concurrency control to ensure serializability and high performance. Our experimental evaluation using the TPC-C benchmark demonstrates that TransAct outperforms existing concurrency control protocols in terms of throughput and response time, while maintaining high transactional consistency.
