This paper presents a novel multi-agent system for real-time resource allocation in smart grids. Our approach, called 'MA-RA', uses a decentralized coordination mechanism to optimize energy distribution and reduce power losses. MA-RA leverages a hierarchical architecture, where local agents negotiate with neighboring agents to allocate resources, and a global agent facilitates system-wide optimization. We demonstrate the scalability and efficacy of MA-RA through simulations on a large-scale smart grid testbed, showcasing significant improvements in response time and energy efficiency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
