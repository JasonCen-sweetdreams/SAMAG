Traditional query expansion techniques rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural query expansion (HNQE) framework that learns to generate context-aware query expansions. HNQE employs a novel attention-based query encoder and a hierarchical query expansion generator, which captures both local and global dependencies in the query. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing computational overhead by up to 30%. We also provide insights into the interpretability of HNQE's learned expansions.
