Conversational search systems rely on effective passage retrieval to provide relevant answers to users' queries. While neural ranking models have shown promising results in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, their performance in conversational search remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of various neural ranking models, including BERT-based and graph-based architectures, for passage retrieval in conversational search. Our experiments on a large-scale conversational search dataset reveal that neural ranking models can significantly outperform traditional retrieval methods, but their performance varies greatly depending on the conversation context and query type. We provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model and discuss implications for future research in conversational search.
