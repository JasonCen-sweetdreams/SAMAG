This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, called AdaptiveDiverRank, which learns to retrieve diverse and relevant documents from a large corpus. Our approach incorporates a self-attention mechanism to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and document contents. We also introduce a novel objective function that optimizes for both relevance and diversity, allowing the model to adapt to varying query types and user preferences. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaptiveDiverRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and diversity metrics.
