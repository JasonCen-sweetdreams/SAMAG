Real-time database systems require efficient indexing mechanisms to support high-performance query processing. Existing indexing techniques often compromise between query latency and update throughput. This paper presents 'Raijin', a novel, adaptive indexing framework that dynamically adjusts the index structure based on workload patterns and system resource utilization. Raijin leverages machine learning-based prediction models to anticipate query patterns and optimize index maintenance, ensuring low query latency and high update throughput. Experimental evaluations on a real-world financial database demonstrate that Raijin outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query latency and 2x in update throughput.
