Knowledge graphs have become a crucial component of many AI applications, but their scale and complexity pose significant challenges for real-time semantic search. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'KG-Index', which leverages graph neural networks to learn compact, semantic representations of entities and relations. We propose a hierarchical indexing scheme that efficiently supports complex queries with multiple predicates and variables. Experimental results on large-scale knowledge graphs demonstrate that KG-Index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in query response time while achieving comparable accuracy.
