As intelligent virtual assistants (IVAs) become increasingly pervasive, it is essential to understand how design elements influence user trust. This study investigates the effect of anthropomorphic design on user trust in IVAs, leveraging a mixed-methods approach combining surveys, interviews, and usability testing. Our findings suggest that anthropomorphic design elements, such as facial features and conversational tone, can positively impact user trust, but only when balanced with transparency and clear functionality. We propose a framework for IVA designers to optimize trustworthiness while minimizing the risks of anthropomorphism.
