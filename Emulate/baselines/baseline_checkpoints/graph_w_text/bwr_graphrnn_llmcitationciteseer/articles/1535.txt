Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but the lack of embodied cognition in VR interfaces hinders user experience. This paper investigates the role of gesture-based interaction in enhancing cognitive engagement and immersion in VR. We designed a VR system that incorporates gesture recognition and haptic feedback, and conducted a user study to evaluate its effectiveness. Results show that our approach significantly improves user satisfaction, reduces cognitive load, and increases presence in VR environments. Our findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and engaging VR interfaces.
