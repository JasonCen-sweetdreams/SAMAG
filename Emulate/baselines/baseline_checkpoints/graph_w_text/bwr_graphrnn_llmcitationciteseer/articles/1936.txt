This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized coordination of autonomous agents in complex, dynamic environments. We propose an adaptive reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to learn cooperative policies while adapting to changing environmental conditions and agent behaviors. Our approach utilizes a decentralized actor-critic architecture, where each agent maintains a local policy and value function, and communicates with its neighbors to leverage shared knowledge. Experimental results in a simulated robotic swarm scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized coordination methods.
