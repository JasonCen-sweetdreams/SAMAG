Node classification in dynamic networks is a challenging task due to the constantly changing graph structure and lack of labeled data. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global graph features to improve node classification performance. HGAT consists of a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively selects relevant nodes and their features at each layer, and a novel graph-based regularization term that encourages the model to learn consistent representations across different graph snapshots. Experimental results on several real-world dynamic networks demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in node classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
