The proliferation of IoT devices and social media has led to an exponential growth in large-scale, semi-structured data. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, called 'LexiSort', specifically designed for real-time analytics on column-oriented NoSQL databases. LexiSort leverages a combination of lexical sorting and adaptive sampling to efficiently identify and retrieve relevant data blocks. Our experimental evaluation on a commercial NoSQL database demonstrates up to 3x improvement in query performance and 2x reduction in storage overhead compared to existing indexing techniques.
