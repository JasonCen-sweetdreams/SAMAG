Traditional query optimizers rely on static database schema assumptions, which can lead to suboptimal performance in modern dynamic databases. We propose an adaptive query optimization framework, 'DynaOpt', which leverages machine learning to predict schema changes and adjust query plans accordingly. DynaOpt integrates a schema change detector, a query plan reoptimizer, and a cost-based optimizer to minimize query latency and resource utilization. Experimental evaluation on a real-world dynamic database benchmark demonstrates that DynaOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and 2x in terms of resource efficiency.
