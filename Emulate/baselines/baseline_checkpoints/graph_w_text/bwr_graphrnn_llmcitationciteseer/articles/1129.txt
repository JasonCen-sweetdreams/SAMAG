This paper presents a novel decentralized approach to coalition formation for autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments. We introduce a distributed algorithm that enables agents to form coalitions in response to changing environmental conditions, such as task availability or resource scarcity. Our approach leverages a combination of machine learning and game-theoretic techniques to facilitate coalition formation, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in a series of simulations involving robotic agents performing complex tasks. Experimental results show that our approach leads to improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to centralized coalition formation methods.
