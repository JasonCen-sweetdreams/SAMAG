Graph attention networks (GATs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks. However, existing GATs are limited by their inability to handle heterogeneous graphs, which are common in real-world applications. This paper proposes HetGAT, a novel graph attention mechanism that efficiently learns node representations in heterogeneous graphs. HetGAT leverages a hierarchical attention architecture that adaptively aggregates features from different node types, enabling effective node classification. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HetGAT outperforms existing GAT variants and achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods.
