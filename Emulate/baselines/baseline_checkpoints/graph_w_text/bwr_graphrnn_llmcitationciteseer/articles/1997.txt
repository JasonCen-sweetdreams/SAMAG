Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must dynamically allocate tasks to optimize system performance. This paper presents a novel approach using autonomous agents that learn to allocate tasks through reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'AgentRL', which enables agents to adapt to changing task demands and environmental conditions. Our approach leverages a hybrid reward function that balances task completion, agent utilization, and communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentRL outperforms traditional task allocation algorithms in complex, dynamic environments.
