Query expansion (QE) and pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) are two widely used techniques for improving document retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates BERT-based QE with PRF to leverage the strengths of both methods. Our approach, termed BERT-QEPRF, uses BERT to generate context-aware query expansions, which are then utilized to select pseudo-relevant documents for feedback. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and TREC-2004 datasets demonstrate that BERT-QEPRF achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art QE and PRF methods, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
