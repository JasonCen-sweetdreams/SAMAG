Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face the challenge of optimizing query processing across multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach using reinforcement learning (RL) to minimize query latency and maximize throughput. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', learns to select the optimal query plan based on node workload, network latency, and data distribution. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a large-scale DIR system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
