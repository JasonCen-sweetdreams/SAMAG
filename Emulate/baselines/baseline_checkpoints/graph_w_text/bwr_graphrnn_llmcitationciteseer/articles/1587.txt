Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing complex relationships between entities. However, optimizing graph queries remains a challenging problem due to the vast search space of possible execution plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to graph query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a graph query optimizer, 'GROQL', that learns to select efficient execution plans through trial and error. Our approach leverages a Markov decision process to model the query optimization problem and employs deep Q-networks to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GROQL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
