This paper presents a novel approach to gesture recognition systems that adapt to the abilities and needs of individuals with motor impairments. Our system, called 'AdaptaGest', uses a machine learning model to learn the user's gesture patterns and adapt the recognition algorithm in real-time. We evaluate AdaptaGest with a user study involving 20 participants with motor impairments and show that it outperforms existing systems in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. We also contribute a new dataset of gesture recordings from individuals with motor impairments, which can be used to train and evaluate future gesture recognition systems.
