Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to revolutionize assistive technology for people with visual impairments. However, current AR interfaces are often inaccessible or unusable for this population. This paper presents a co-design approach to developing AR interfaces that are tailored to the needs and preferences of visually impaired users. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with visually impaired individuals, resulting in the development of a novel AR-based navigation system that leverages audio and haptic feedback. Our user study demonstrates significant improvements in navigation efficiency and user satisfaction compared to existing AR systems.
