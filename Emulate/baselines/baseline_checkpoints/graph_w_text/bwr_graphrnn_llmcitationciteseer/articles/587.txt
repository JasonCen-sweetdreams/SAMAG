Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has emerged as a crucial technique for link prediction in multi-relational graphs. However, existing KGE methods often neglect the hierarchical structure inherent in many real-world graphs. This paper introduces 'HATT-KGE', a novel framework that leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between entities and their attributes. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HATT-KGE outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods in multi-relational link prediction tasks, while reducing computational overhead.
