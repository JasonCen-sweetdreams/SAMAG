Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but its computational complexity can be prohibitive for large document collections. This paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based approach to query expansion, which leverages the structural properties of hypergraphs to efficiently identify relevant terms and documents. Our methodology, 'HyperQE', represents queries and documents as hyperedges and nodes, respectively, and applies a probabilistic inference framework to estimate the relevance of expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency.
