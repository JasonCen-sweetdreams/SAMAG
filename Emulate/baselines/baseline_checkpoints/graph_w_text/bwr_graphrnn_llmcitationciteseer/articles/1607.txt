Existing neural ranking models for ad-hoc retrieval often rely on static document embeddings, neglecting the nuanced relationships between queries and documents. We propose a novel query-dependent neural embedding approach, 'QDNE', which generates dynamic document representations conditioned on the query context. Our approach leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to capture fine-grained semantic interactions between query terms and document entities. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that QDNE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of NDCG@10 and ERR, while maintaining computational efficiency.
