Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of dynamically allocating resources to meet varying workloads and optimize performance. This paper proposes a novel deep adaptive reinforcement learning framework, 'DARLA', which leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning and adaptive exploration to optimize resource allocation in cloud computing environments. We demonstrate that DARLA achieves significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we show that DARLA can adapt to changing workloads and scales well to large-scale cloud deployments.
