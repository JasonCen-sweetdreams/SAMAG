Query optimization is a critical component of distributed graph databases, as it directly impacts query performance and system scalability. However, existing optimization techniques rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, leading to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed graph databases. We design a custom environment and reward function to train an agent that learns to select efficient query plans based on graph topology, data distribution, and system workload. Our experiments on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and scalability compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
