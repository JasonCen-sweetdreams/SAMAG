Gesture recognition is a crucial component in virtual reality (VR) systems, but existing methods often rely on machine learning models that can be brittle to variations in user input. This paper investigates the effect of visual feedback on gesture recognition accuracy in VR. We design a novel visualization framework that provides users with real-time feedback on their gestures, and conduct a user study to evaluate its impact on recognition accuracy. Results show that our approach improves recognition accuracy by 12.5% compared to baseline methods, and also reduces user fatigue and cognitive load. Our findings have implications for the design of more effective and user-friendly VR interfaces.
