Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that efficiently generates explanations for recommended items. Our approach leverages a hierarchical self-attention mechanism to identify relevant item features and user preferences, enabling the model to focus on the most important aspects of the recommendation process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing transparent and interpretable explanations for recommended items.
