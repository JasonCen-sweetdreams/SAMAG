Fake news detection remains a critical challenge in natural language processing. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) framework that leverages graph-based representation learning and attention mechanisms to identify fake news articles. We introduce a hierarchical graph structure that captures both local and global contextual relationships between news articles and their corresponding user engagements. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fake news detection, while providing interpretable explanations for its predictions.
