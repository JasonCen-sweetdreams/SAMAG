Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various applications, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, existing methods struggle to scale with the increasing volume and complexity of data. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'TS-ADNet', which leverages a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture to learn robust representations of time series data. Our method can efficiently handle long-term dependencies and identify anomalies through a reconstruction-based method. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-ADNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
