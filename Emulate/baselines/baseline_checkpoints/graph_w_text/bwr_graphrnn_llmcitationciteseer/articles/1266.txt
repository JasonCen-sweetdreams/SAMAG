Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to revolutionize assistive technologies for users with visual impairments. However, designing accessible AR interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel framework for creating inclusive AR experiences, focusing on auditory and haptic feedback. We conducted user studies with visually impaired participants to inform the design of an AR-based navigation system, which was then evaluated in a controlled experiment. Results show significant improvements in navigation accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing assistive technologies. Our framework provides a foundation for future research on accessible AR interface design.
