Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning approach, 'RL-QE', which leverages a Markov decision process to optimize query expansion. Our method learns to select and weight relevant terms from a knowledge graph, outperforming traditional techniques based on statistical analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-QE on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
