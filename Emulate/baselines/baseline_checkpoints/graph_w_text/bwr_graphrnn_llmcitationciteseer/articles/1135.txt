Traditional query expansion techniques often struggle to capture the nuances of heterogeneous document collections, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion framework, 'CAQE', which incorporates semantic and syntactic features from the document collection to generate context-specific expansion terms. CAQE leverages a graph-based attention mechanism to weight the contribution of each feature, enabling the model to adapt to diverse document collections. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving up to 25% improvement in retrieval precision.
