Gaze-based interfaces have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but accurate fixation detection remains a significant challenge. This paper presents EyeGaze+, a novel approach that leverages deep learning to improve fixation detection in gaze-based interaction. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to identify fixations from raw eye-tracking data, achieving an average accuracy of 95.2% on a benchmark dataset. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EyeGaze+ in a gaze-based typing application, resulting in a 23.4% reduction in error rate compared to traditional fixation detection methods.
