This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent planning that leverages hierarchical task networks (HTNs) and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). Our method, called HMA-Plan, decomposes complex tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks and assigns them to individual agents. We use MCTS to efficiently explore the vast search space of possible plans and prune infeasible solutions. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark domains demonstrate that HMA-Plan scales to large teams of agents and outperforms state-of-the-art planning algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
