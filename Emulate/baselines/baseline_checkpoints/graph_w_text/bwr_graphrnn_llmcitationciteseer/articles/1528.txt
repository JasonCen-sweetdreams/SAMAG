Column-oriented databases have gained popularity in big data analytics, but their performance is often bottlenecked by inefficient indexing strategies. This paper presents a novel adaptive indexing approach, 'AIIX', which dynamically adjusts the indexing configuration based on query patterns and data distributions. AIIX leverages a cost-based optimization framework to select the most effective indexing strategy for each query, considering factors such as data skew, query frequency, and storage constraints. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AIIX achieves up to 3x query performance improvement compared to traditional indexing methods, with minimal overhead in terms of storage and maintenance costs.
