Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it aims to bridge the gap between the user's query and the relevant documents. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach for query expansion, which leverages the capabilities of neural networks to learn semantic relationships between words. Our approach, dubbed 'NeuroQE', uses a combination of word embeddings and recurrent neural networks to generate expanded queries that better capture the user's intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval effectiveness.
