Real-time data streams have become ubiquitous in modern applications, posing significant challenges for distributed database systems. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'StreamIX', designed to efficiently process high-velocity data streams in distributed settings. StreamIX leverages a combination of in-memory indexing, adaptive sampling, and parallel query processing to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale distributed database cluster demonstrates that StreamIX outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time and 2x in terms of data ingestion rate.
