As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding human-robot collaboration in these environments is crucial. This study explores the role of embodiment in VR on human trust and performance in collaborative tasks with robots. We designed an experiment where participants, immersed in VR, collaborated with a robotic arm to complete a puzzle. Our results show that participants who embodied the robot's movements exhibited higher trust and completed tasks more efficiently than those who did not. Furthermore, we found that embodiment increased the perceived sense of agency and social presence. These findings have implications for the design of VR-based human-robot collaboration systems, highlighting the importance of considering embodiment in these interactions.
