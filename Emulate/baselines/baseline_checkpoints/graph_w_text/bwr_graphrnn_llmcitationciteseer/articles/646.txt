This paper investigates the potential of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) to enhance user experience. We designed a gestural interface that leverages users' bodily movements to interact with virtual objects, fostering a sense of agency and immersion. Our user study reveals that embodied interaction significantly improves task performance, reduces cognitive load, and increases user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems that take advantage of embodied cognition principles to create more engaging and effective user experiences.
