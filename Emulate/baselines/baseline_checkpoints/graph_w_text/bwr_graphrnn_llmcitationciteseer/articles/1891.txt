Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a popular technique to improve retrieval performance, but it often relies on handcrafted rules or traditional machine learning methods. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach to query expansion, which learns to generate context-aware and semantically enriched query representations. Our approach, dubbed 'DeepQE', leverages a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query expansion and document ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
