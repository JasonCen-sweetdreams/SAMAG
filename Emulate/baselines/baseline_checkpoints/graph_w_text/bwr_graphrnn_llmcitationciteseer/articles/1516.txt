This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, where agents form coalitions to execute complex tasks. We introduce a distributed coalition formation algorithm that leverages graph theory and social welfare optimization to ensure efficient task allocation. Our approach is robust to changes in agent capabilities and task requirements, and can adapt to dynamic environments. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and agent utility compared to existing decentralized allocation methods.
