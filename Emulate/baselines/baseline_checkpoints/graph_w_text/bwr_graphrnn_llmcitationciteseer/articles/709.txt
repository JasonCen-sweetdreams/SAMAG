Time-series data warehouses are increasingly used in IoT and financial applications, but indexing large-scale datasets remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'HBIndex', which leverages hierarchical Bloom filters to efficiently query and aggregate time-series data. We demonstrate that HBIndex outperforms existing indexing methods in terms of query latency and storage efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset show that HBIndex can scale to tens of millions of time-series data points with minimal overhead.
