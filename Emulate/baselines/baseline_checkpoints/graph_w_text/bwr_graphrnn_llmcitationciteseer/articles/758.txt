 Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with motor impairments, but existing systems often fail to accommodate their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing an inclusive gesture recognition system, tailored to the abilities and preferences of older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies to identify key design requirements, including adaptable gesture sets, personalized feedback mechanisms, and accessible system interfaces. Our results show that our system achieves high recognition accuracy and user satisfaction, even for users with severe motor impairments.
