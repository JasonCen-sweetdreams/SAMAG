Cognitive load is a critical factor in human-computer interaction, as excessive mental effort can lead to fatigue and decreased performance. This paper presents a novel approach to measuring cognitive load using gaze-based features, which are extracted from eye-tracking data. We propose a machine learning model that leverages these features to predict cognitive load in real-time, enabling intelligent adaptive interfaces to adjust their complexity and support accordingly. Our evaluation on a dataset of 30 participants performing a problem-solving task shows that our approach outperforms existing methods in accuracy and latency.
