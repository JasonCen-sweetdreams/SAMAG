Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used to handle large-scale data workloads, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents an adaptive indexing technique, 'AdapIndex', which dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distributions. Our approach leverages machine learning models to predict query access patterns and optimize index configuration accordingly. Experimental results on a real-world DDS deployment show that AdapIndex reduces query latency by up to 40% and improves throughput by up to 25% compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods.
