Gesture recognition is a crucial component of immersive virtual reality (VR) experiences. While machine learning-based approaches have improved recognition accuracy, the role of visual feedback in enhancing user performance remains understudied. This paper investigates the effects of real-time visual feedback on gesture recognition in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, comparing three feedback conditions: no feedback, abstract feedback, and realistic feedback. Our results show that realistic feedback significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and user confidence, particularly for complex gestures. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR interface design and future research directions.
