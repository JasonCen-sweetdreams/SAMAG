Distributed cloud computing environments face significant challenges in load balancing, leading to reduced system efficiency and increased latency. This paper proposes an autonomous agent-based load balancing framework, 'AALB', which leverages intelligent agents to dynamically allocate workload and resources. AALB integrates a decentralized decision-making mechanism, where agents negotiate and adapt to changing workload patterns, and a reinforcement learning-based policy optimization module to improve system performance. Experimental results on a large-scale cloud computing testbed demonstrate that AALB outperforms traditional load balancing strategies in terms of response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
