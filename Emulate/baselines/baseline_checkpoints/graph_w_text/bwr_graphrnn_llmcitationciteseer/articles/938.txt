Traditional term weighting schemes in information retrieval rely on simple statistics and often fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms and documents. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'TermRank', which leverages a neural network to learn context-aware term weights that incorporate both local and global document features. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that TermRank significantly outperforms state-of-the-art term weighting methods, achieving improved ranking quality and retrieval efficiency.
