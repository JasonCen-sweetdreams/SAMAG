This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for multi-agent systems, leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. We formalize the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and propose a hierarchical Q-network architecture that learns to allocate tasks based on agent capabilities, task priority, and environmental constraints. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional distributed allocation methods.
