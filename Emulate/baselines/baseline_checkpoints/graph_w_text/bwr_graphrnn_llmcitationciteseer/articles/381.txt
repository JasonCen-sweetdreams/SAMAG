Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges when interacting with computers, resulting in high error rates and frustration. This paper presents a novel gaze-based typing error correction system, 'GazeCorrect', designed for users with motor impairments. GazeCorrect utilizes a machine learning-based approach to predict the intended key press based on the user's gaze patterns, correcting errors in real-time. Our evaluation with 20 participants demonstrated a significant reduction in error rates (45.6%) and increased typing speed (23.4%) compared to traditional gaze-based typing systems.
