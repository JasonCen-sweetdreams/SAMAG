E-commerce search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant products from massive catalogs. Traditional ranking models often rely on hand-crafted features, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'NRM-ec', which leverages deep learning techniques to learn hierarchical representations of products and queries. We introduce a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes ranking and product attribute prediction tasks. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that NRM-ec outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of precision, recall, and query latency.
