Medical image segmentation is a crucial task in disease diagnosis, but the uncertainty associated with model predictions can lead to incorrect diagnoses. This paper proposes a deep ensemble learning framework, 'MedSegEnsemble', which leverages multiple diverse models to estimate uncertainty in medical image segmentation tasks. We introduce a novel Bayesian neural network architecture that incorporates Monte Carlo dropout and batch normalization to estimate epistemic uncertainty. Experimental results on the BraTS dataset demonstrate that MedSegEnsemble outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of segmentation accuracy and uncertainty estimation, while providing interpretable uncertainty maps for radiologists.
