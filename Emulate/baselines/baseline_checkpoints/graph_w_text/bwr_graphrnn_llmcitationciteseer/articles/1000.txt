This paper explores the design of gesture-based interfaces that cater to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to identify the challenges they face when interacting with existing gesture recognition systems. Our findings indicate that current systems often neglect the needs of this population, leading to frustration and disengagement. We propose a novel framework, 'GESTALT', which incorporates adaptive gesture recognition, personalized feedback, and error correction mechanisms. Our evaluation demonstrates that GESTALT significantly improves the interaction experience and reduces cognitive load for older adults with cognitive impairments.
