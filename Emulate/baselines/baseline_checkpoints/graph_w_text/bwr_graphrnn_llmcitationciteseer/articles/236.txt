Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but it remains challenging due to the presence of noisy or adversarial nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that learns to selectively focus on informative nodes and filter out noisy ones. Our approach consists of a hierarchical node representation module and a attention-based node classification module. We demonstrate the robustness of HGAT on several benchmark datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the presence of noise and attacks.
