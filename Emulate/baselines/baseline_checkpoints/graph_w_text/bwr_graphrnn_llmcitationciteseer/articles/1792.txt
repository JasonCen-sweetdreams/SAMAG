Resource Description Framework (RDF) databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query processing efficiency remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of RDF data models and the lack of effective indexing strategies. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, RDF-GIN, which leverages the structural properties of RDF graphs to accelerate query processing. We demonstrate that RDF-GIN outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 30% in terms of query response time and reduces memory consumption by up to 25% on real-world RDF datasets.
