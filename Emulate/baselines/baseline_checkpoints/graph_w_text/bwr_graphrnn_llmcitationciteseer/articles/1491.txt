Distributed relational databases are widely used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GRIX', which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to efficiently prune the search space. By exploiting the correlations between query predicates and join orders, GRIX reduces the number of possible execution plans, leading to improved query performance and reduced latency. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that GRIX outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query throughput and resource utilization.
