Hierarchical collections, such as file systems or digital libraries, pose significant challenges for traditional IR systems. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, HiRank, which leverages the hierarchical structure to improve document retrieval. HiRank incorporates a graph attention mechanism to capture semantic relationships between documents and their hierarchical contexts. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HiRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models on hierarchical collections, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
