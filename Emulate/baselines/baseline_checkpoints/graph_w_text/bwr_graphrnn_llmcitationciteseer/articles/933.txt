This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have varying capabilities and tasks have diverse requirements. We design an auction-based mechanism that enables agents to bid on tasks based on their self-assessed capabilities and preferences. Our approach incorporates a novel bid validation scheme to prevent strategic manipulation and ensure truthfulness. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
