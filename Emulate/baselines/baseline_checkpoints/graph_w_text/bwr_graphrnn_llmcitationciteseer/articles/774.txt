In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive solutions. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning approach for autonomous task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We propose a decentralized framework that enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing task requirements. Our approach leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture that combines both task-level and agent-level decision-making. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
