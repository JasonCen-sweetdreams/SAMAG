The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of sensor-generated data, making it increasingly challenging to identify anomalous patterns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for time-series anomaly detection in IoT sensor data. Our approach leverages a multi-scale attention mechanism to capture complex dependencies across different time granularities, allowing for more accurate detection of anomalies. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that our HAN approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and detection latency.
