Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel knowledge graph embedding method, 'ExplainKG', which incorporates both structural and semantic information from knowledge graphs to provide personalized explanations for recommendations. ExplainKG learns entity and relation embeddings by jointly optimizing a multi-task loss function that combines recommendation and explanation objectives. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate that ExplainKG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
