This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for adaptive traffic signal control. We model the traffic network as a Markov game, where each traffic signal is an autonomous agent learning to optimize traffic flow. Our approach, called 'MATraffic', uses a decentralized deep Q-network to learn cooperative policies among agents, taking into account local traffic conditions, pedestrian and cyclist presence, and real-time traffic signal timings. Experimental results on a simulated urban traffic network demonstrate that MATraffic reduces congestion, travel times, and emissions compared to traditional fixed-time signal control methods.
