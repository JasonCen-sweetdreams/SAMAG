Edge computing has given rise to novel applications requiring autonomous decision-making in dynamic environments. This paper presents a decentralized agent-based framework for efficient task allocation in edge computing. We introduce a novel coordination mechanism, 'AgentSync', that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing resource availability and task priorities. Our approach enables agents to learn from experience, negotiate, and adjust their strategies in real-time to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentSync in reducing task completion times by up to 35% in simulated edge computing scenarios.
