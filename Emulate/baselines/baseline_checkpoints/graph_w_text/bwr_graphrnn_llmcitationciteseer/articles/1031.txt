The rapid growth of digital data necessitates efficient information retrieval systems. This paper presents HierRank, a novel neural ranking model for document filtering that scales to large datasets. HierRank adopts a hierarchical architecture, where coarse-grained filtering is performed using a sparse, learned index, and fine-grained ranking is achieved through a dense, neural network-based model. Experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency. We also analyze the performance of HierRank on a large-scale, industrial dataset, showcasing its feasibility in real-world applications.
