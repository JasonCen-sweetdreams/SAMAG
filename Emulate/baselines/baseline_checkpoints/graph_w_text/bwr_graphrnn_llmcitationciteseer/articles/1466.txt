Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when faced with novel tasks. This paper introduces a novel meta-learning approach, 'TaskAware', which leverages task-aware attention mechanisms to adapt to new tasks with limited labeled data. Our method learns to selectively focus on relevant task-specific features and adapt the attention weights based on the task distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TaskAware on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on few-shot image classification tasks while reducing computational overhead.
