This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent system for real-time traffic management, which can efficiently coordinate traffic signals and routing to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. Our approach leverages a novel auction-based mechanism to allocate resources and resolve conflicts between agents, ensuring scalability and robustness in large-scale networks. We evaluate our system using a realistic traffic simulator and demonstrate significant improvements in network throughput and travel time reduction compared to traditional centralized approaches.
