The proliferation of fake news on social media has severe consequences for individuals and society. Despite advances in deep learning-based fake news detection, interpretability remains a major concern. This paper proposes a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages the structural properties of social networks to identify suspicious patterns. Our approach incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to focus on critical nodes and edges, enabling the identification of key propagators and topics contributing to fake news dissemination. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HGAT in improving detection accuracy while providing insights into the underlying diffusion mechanisms.
