This paper addresses the task allocation problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and preferences need to form coalitions to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a decentralized coalition formation algorithm that leverages preference elicitation and graph theory to identify stable and efficient coalitions. Our approach incorporates a novel mechanism for handling conflicting preferences and ensuring fairness among agents. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing decentralized coalition formation methods in terms of coalition stability, task completion rate, and fairness metrics.
