Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant texts for answer extraction. This paper presents a novel hierarchical question embedding (HQE) framework that captures multi-granular semantic relationships between questions and passages. Our approach leverages a transformer-based encoder to generate hierarchical representations of questions, which are then used to retrieve top-k passages from a large corpus. Experimental results on the Natural Questions benchmark demonstrate that HQE-based passage retrieval outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12.3% improvement in top-1 passage accuracy while reducing retrieval time by 30%.
