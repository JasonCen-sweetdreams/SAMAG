Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has revolutionized open-domain question answering by leveraging neural networks to encode queries and passages. However, DPR often struggles with lexical mismatch and limited context. This paper proposes a neural query expansion (NQE) approach that generates semantically rich and diverse query representations. Our NQE model is trained using a combination of contrastive learning and semantic similarity metrics, allowing it to effectively capture latent query intents. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that NQE-enhanced DPR outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving a 13.5% relative improvement in top-1 accuracy.
