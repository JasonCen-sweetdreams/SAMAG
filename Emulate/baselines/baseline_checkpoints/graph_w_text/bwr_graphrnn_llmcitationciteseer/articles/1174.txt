Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. Existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering or supervised learning, which can be time-consuming and require large labeled datasets. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach, Graph-AE, which leverages graph-based autoencoders to learn a compact representation of time-series data. By reconstructing the graph structure, our method detects anomalies as nodes with high reconstruction error. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Graph-AE in identifying anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall.
