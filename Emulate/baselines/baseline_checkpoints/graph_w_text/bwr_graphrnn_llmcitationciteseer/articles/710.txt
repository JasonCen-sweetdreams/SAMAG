Conventional query expansion methods often rely on term co-occurrence and relevance feedback, but may produce homogeneous search results. This paper introduces a novel reinforced query expansion approach, 'RQE-Div', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize search result diversity. By framing query expansion as a Markov decision process, RQE-Div adaptively selects expansion terms that maximize a diversity metric, while balancing precision and recall. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that RQE-Div outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of search result diversity, while maintaining competitive precision and recall.
