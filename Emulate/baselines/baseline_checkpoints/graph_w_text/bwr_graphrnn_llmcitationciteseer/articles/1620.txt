As smart home devices become increasingly pervasive, secure authentication mechanisms are essential to prevent unauthorized access. This paper presents a novel gesture-based authentication system, 'SmartGest', designed for smart home devices. Our approach leverages machine learning algorithms to recognize and verify user-specific hand gestures captured by device-embedded cameras. We conducted a user study with 50 participants, demonstrating a false acceptance rate of 2.1% and a false rejection rate of 1.5%. Our system is robust against various attack scenarios and provides an intuitive, touchless authentication experience for users.
