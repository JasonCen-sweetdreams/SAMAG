Road traffic prediction is a complex task that involves capturing intricate patterns in spatial and temporal data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that leverages both node-level and graph-level attention mechanisms to model traffic dynamics. HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, achieving a 12.5% improvement in mean absolute error. Furthermore, we demonstrate the interpretability of HGAT through visualizations of attention weights, providing insights into the most influential roads and time intervals for traffic prediction.
