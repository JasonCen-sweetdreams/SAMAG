Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for elderly individuals with cognitive impairments, but current interfaces often exacerbate existing accessibility barriers. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating inclusive VR interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 elderly participants with cognitive impairments, revealing key design recommendations for simplifying navigation, enhancing visual cues, and incorporating assistive features. Our prototype, 'ElderVR', demonstrates significant improvements in user engagement and task completion rates compared to commercial VR systems.
