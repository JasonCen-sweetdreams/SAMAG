Temporal graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale, time-evolving graph data. However, existing query optimization techniques are often ineffective for real-time analytics workloads, leading to poor performance and high latency. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'Tempo', which leverages graph structural properties and temporal dependencies to generate efficient query plans. We propose a cost-based optimization approach that incorporates a probabilistic model of query execution times, enabling Tempo to adapt to dynamic workloads and data distributions. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that Tempo outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 5x in terms of query latency and throughput.
