Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging problem in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with complex queries. This paper presents a novel neural ranking model, 'QueryGraph', which represents queries as graph structures to capture semantic relationships between entities and keywords. By incorporating a graph attention mechanism, QueryGraph can selectively focus on relevant query aspects and effectively aggregate evidence from different document regions. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in ranking accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
