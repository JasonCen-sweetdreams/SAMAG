Dialogue state tracking (DST) is a critical component of conversational AI systems, requiring accurate identification of user goals and preferences. We propose a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that leverages the graphical structure of dialogue flows to improve DST performance. HGAT employs a novel hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant dialogue context and entities, reducing computational complexity and improving robustness to noisy user inputs. Experimental results on the MultiWOZ benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art DST models in terms of joint goal accuracy and scalability.
