Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in smart homes, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by usability issues and inaccessible design. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify key challenges and preferences. Our findings inform the development of 'EasyVoice', a voice assistant tailored to older adults' needs, with features such as simplified syntax, audio feedback, and personalized assistance. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrates that EasyVoice outperforms existing voice assistants in terms of accessibility, usability, and user satisfaction.
