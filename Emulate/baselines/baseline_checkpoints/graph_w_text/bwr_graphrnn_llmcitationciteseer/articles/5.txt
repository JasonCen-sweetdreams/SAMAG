Time series forecasting models often struggle to provide interpretable insights into their predictions. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that leverages both local and global dependencies in time series data to improve forecasting accuracy and explainability. Our HAN model uses a novel attention mechanism that adaptively selects the most relevant segments and features at multiple scales, enabling the model to focus on the most informative parts of the input data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of forecasting accuracy and provides more informative feature importance scores.
