As data warehouses continue to scale, query optimization becomes increasingly crucial for efficient data retrieval. This paper presents a novel query optimization technique, 'CSI-Opt', which leverages column store indexing to reduce query latency in distributed data warehouses. We propose a cost-based optimization model that considers both data locality and storage efficiency, resulting in improved query performance and reduced storage costs. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that CSI-Opt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
