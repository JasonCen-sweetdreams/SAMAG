Virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) have become increasingly popular, but their security remains a major concern. This paper presents a novel gaze-based authentication system, 'GazeSecure', designed specifically for VR HMDs. GazeSecure leverages the high-resolution eye-tracking capabilities of modern VR HMDs to authenticate users based on their unique gaze patterns. Our approach uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to analyze the user's gaze behavior and verify their identity. Experimental results show that GazeSecure achieves an accuracy of 97.5% and a false acceptance rate of 0.5%, outperforming existing authentication methods for VR HMDs.
