Virtual reality (VR) technology has become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including gaming, education, and healthcare. However, the security of user authentication in VR environments remains a significant concern. This paper investigates the effectiveness of gesture-based authentication in VR, focusing on the trade-off between security and usability. We designed and implemented a gesture-based authentication system, 'VR-GestureAuth', and evaluated its performance with 30 participants. Our results show that VR-GestureAuth achieves a high authentication accuracy of 95.6% while maintaining a relatively low false rejection rate of 12.5%. Furthermore, our user study reveals that participants prefer gesture-based authentication over traditional password-based methods in VR environments.
