The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to a surge in demand for efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for adaptive resource allocation in IoT networks. Our approach leverages a novel graph neural network architecture to learn a distributed policy that allocates resources based on real-time network conditions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive simulations, showing significant improvements in network throughput and latency compared to centralized optimization methods.
