Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the need to minimize communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using learned index structures, which can efficiently prune the search space and reduce query latency. We introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework that learns to optimize queries based on graph structural properties and query patterns. Experimental results on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
