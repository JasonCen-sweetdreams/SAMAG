In multi-agent systems, achieving consensus in the presence of Byzantine faults is a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel decentralized consensus protocol, 'Byzantine-Resilient Consensus' (BRC), which guarantees consensus even when up to one-third of agents are Byzantine faulty. BRC leverages a combination of digital signatures, voting mechanisms, and a reputation system to detect and isolate faulty agents. We prove the correctness and fault tolerance of BRC through formal verification and evaluate its performance on a simulated multi-agent system, demonstrating improved resilience and efficiency compared to existing Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus protocols.
