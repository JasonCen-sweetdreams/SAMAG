Recommender systems face scalability challenges as the number of users and items grows. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships. HGAT hierarchically aggregates node representations, enabling efficient processing of large graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on several real-world datasets, achieving significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and scalability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
