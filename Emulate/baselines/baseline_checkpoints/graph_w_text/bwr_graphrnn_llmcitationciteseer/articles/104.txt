Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are crucial for efficient querying of large-scale data repositories. However, the high communication overhead between nodes can significantly slow down query processing. This paper presents a novel hierarchical hashing scheme, 'HierHash', which reduces query latency by up to 30% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. HierHash leverages a hierarchical indexing structure to prune unnecessary node communications, resulting in improved query efficiency and fault tolerance. We evaluate HierHash on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness in various query scenarios.
