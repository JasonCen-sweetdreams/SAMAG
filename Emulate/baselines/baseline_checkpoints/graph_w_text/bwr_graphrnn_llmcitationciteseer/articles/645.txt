This paper presents EyeCare, a novel gaze-based interactive system designed to assist visually impaired users in navigating digital interfaces. By leveraging advancements in eye-tracking technology and machine learning, EyeCare enables users to interact with graphical user interfaces using only their gaze. Our system incorporates a novel calibration mechanism that adapts to the user's visual impairment, ensuring accurate and reliable gaze tracking. We evaluate EyeCare through a user study involving 20 visually impaired participants, demonstrating significant improvements in interaction speed and accuracy compared to traditional assistive technologies.
