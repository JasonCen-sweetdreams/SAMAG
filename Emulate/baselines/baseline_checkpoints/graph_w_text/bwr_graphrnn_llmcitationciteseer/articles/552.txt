As AI systems increasingly support human decision-making, understanding cognitive load is crucial for effective collaboration. This paper presents a novel, multimodal approach to visualize cognitive load in real-time, leveraging EEG, eye-tracking, and mouse interaction data. We introduce a cognitive load modeling framework that integrates machine learning and signal processing techniques to detect cognitive workload, mental fatigue, and attention allocation. Our user study with 30 participants demonstrates the efficacy of our approach in enhancing human-AI collaboration, improving decision accuracy by 23%, and reducing cognitive load by 17%. The proposed framework has implications for designing more effective and human-centered AI systems.
