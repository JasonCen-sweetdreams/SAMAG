Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their scalability and fault-tolerance. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization, which models the query plan as a graph and leverages graph neural networks to predict the optimal plan. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
