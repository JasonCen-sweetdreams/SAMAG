As the global population ages, there is a growing need to design user interfaces that are accessible and usable for older adults. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to designing gesture-based interfaces that can adapt to the unique needs and abilities of older adults. We propose a novel gesture recognition system that leverages a probabilistic modeling approach to identify gestures that are most intuitive for older adults. Our user study with 30 older adults reveals that our system achieves a significant reduction in error rates and improves overall user satisfaction compared to traditional gesture recognition systems.
