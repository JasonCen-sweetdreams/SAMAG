As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible voice-based interfaces that cater to older adults with hearing impairments. This paper presents an exploratory study on the design of inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a series of user interviews and usability testing sessions to identify key challenges and preferences. Our results highlight the importance of speech rate adjustment, visual feedback, and personalized acoustic models. We propose a novel multimodal interface that incorporates these features, achieving a 30% improvement in task completion rate and 25% reduction in user frustration.
