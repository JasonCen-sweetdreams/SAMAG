Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods often suffer from lexical mismatch and semantic ambiguity. This paper proposes a neural re-ranking approach, 'NeuQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to capture nuanced context and semantics. NeuQE reformulates the QE problem as a ranking task, where the model predicts the relevance of expansion terms based on their semantic similarity to the original query. Experiments on standard TREC datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art QE methods. We also show that NeuQE can be efficiently integrated into existing retrieval pipelines, making it a viable solution for large-scale search engines.
