Recommender systems have increasingly relied on knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to incorporate semantic information. However, existing KGE methods suffer from scalability issues and fail to capture hierarchical relationships. This paper proposes a novel approach, HierGraph, which leverages hierarchical graph attention to efficiently embed knowledge graphs. By aggregating node representations at multiple scales, HierGraph improves recommendation accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate the applicability of HierGraph in real-world AI-powered recommender systems.
