Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, using a mixed-methods approach to analyze both quantitative and qualitative data. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, improved sense of presence, and reduced cybersickness. We also identify key factors influencing avatar personalization, including facial similarity, body shape, and clothing style.
