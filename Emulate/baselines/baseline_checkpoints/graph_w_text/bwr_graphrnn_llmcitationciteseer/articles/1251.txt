In distributed database systems, query optimization is critical to minimize latency and improve performance. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach to query optimization, which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to identify optimal execution plans. We propose a hierarchical graph decomposition method that reduces the complexity of query optimization and enables the identification of parallelizable sub-queries. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate a significant reduction in query latency and improvement in system throughput compared to traditional optimization techniques.
