This paper proposes a novel approach to document retrieval using supervised neural ranking models. We introduce a deep learning architecture that jointly learns to represent documents and queries in a shared semantic space, enabling accurate retrieval of relevant documents. Our method leverages a large-scale dataset of labeled query-document pairs to train a neural ranking model that outperforms traditional retrieval methods. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain over state-of-the-art baselines.
