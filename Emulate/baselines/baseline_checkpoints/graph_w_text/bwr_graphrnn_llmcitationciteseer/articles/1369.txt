Traditional neural ranking models for information retrieval often rely on exhaustive document encoding, leading to increased computational costs. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive neural ranking framework, 'QNRF', which dynamically selects relevant document snippets based on query semantics. By incorporating a query-dependent attention mechanism, QNRF significantly reduces the number of required document encodings while maintaining retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that QNRF achieves state-of-the-art efficiency gains without compromising ranking accuracy.
