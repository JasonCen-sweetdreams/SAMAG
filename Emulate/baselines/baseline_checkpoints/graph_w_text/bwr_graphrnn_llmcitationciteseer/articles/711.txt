Open-domain question answering (ODQA) models rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant information. We propose a novel approach, Hierarchical Dense Passage Retrieval (HDPR), which leverages hierarchical dense representations to capture both local and global contextual information. Our experiments on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that HDPR significantly outperforms existing dense retrieval methods, achieving state-of-the-art results on both datasets. We also show that HDPR can be seamlessly integrated with existing ODQA architectures, leading to improved end-to-end performance.
