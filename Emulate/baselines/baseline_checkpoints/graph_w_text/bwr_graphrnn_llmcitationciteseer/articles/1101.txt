Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely heavily on query expansion techniques to improve retrieval performance. Traditional methods, however, often rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'NeuQE', which leverages deep neural ranking models to learn semantic query representations. We employ a multi-task learning objective that jointly optimizes query expansion and document ranking, enabling NeuQE to adapt to varying query contexts. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and NDCG@20 over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
