Accurate question answering over knowledge graphs (KGs) has become increasingly important. However, existing methods struggle to handle complex, multi-hop questions. This paper proposes a novel KG embedding approach, 'HierAttKG', which leverages hierarchical attention to model relationships between entities and predicates at different levels of abstraction. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierAttKG outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 10% in terms of answer accuracy, while reducing the number of required model parameters by 30%. We also show that HierAttKG can be easily integrated into existing question answering frameworks, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.
