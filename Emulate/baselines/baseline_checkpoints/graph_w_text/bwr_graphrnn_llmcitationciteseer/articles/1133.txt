Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent from a single query. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) is a well-known technique to improve retrieval performance by incorporating feedback from top-ranked documents. However, existing PRF methods can be computationally expensive and may not effectively leverage the feedback. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'PRF-Boost', which adaptively selects and weights PRF terms based on their semantic relevance to the original query. Our experiments on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, with PRF-Boost outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
