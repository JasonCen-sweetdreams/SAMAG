Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale data. However, query processing remains a significant bottleneck due to the complexities of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraphIX', which leverages graph theory to efficiently prune irrelevant data partitions and minimize communication costs. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphIX reduces query response time by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques, while maintaining comparable query accuracy.
