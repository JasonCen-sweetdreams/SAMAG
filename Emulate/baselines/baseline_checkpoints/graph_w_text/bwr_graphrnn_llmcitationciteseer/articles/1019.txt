We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for autonomous urban traffic management. Our approach, called 'TrafficMAgent', coordinates the actions of multiple traffic agents to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. Each agent learns to make decisions based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents, while a centralized controller provides high-level guidance. We evaluate TrafficMAgent in a simulated urban traffic scenario and demonstrate improved traffic throughput and reduced travel times compared to traditional traffic management strategies.
