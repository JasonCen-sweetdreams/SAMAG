Query optimization is a crucial component of database systems, and join order enumeration is a key step in this process. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, which can lead to suboptimal plans. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize join order enumeration. Our method, called 'JoinRL', uses a neural network to learn a policy that guides the search for optimal join orders. We evaluate JoinRL on a range of benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
