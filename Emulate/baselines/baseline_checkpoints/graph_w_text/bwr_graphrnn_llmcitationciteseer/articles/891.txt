This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing gesture-based interfaces for older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving participatory design workshops, usability testing, and gesture recognition experiments. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive gesture recognition, personalized feedback, and intuitive visual cues in promoting accessibility and user satisfaction. We propose a novel gesture-based interface framework, 'EasyGesture', which incorporates machine learning-driven gesture classification and real-time adaptation to user abilities. Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user experience for older adults with motor impairments.
