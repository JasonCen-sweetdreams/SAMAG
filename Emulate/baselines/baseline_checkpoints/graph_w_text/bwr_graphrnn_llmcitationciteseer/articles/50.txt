In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects the overall performance and efficiency of the system. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that utilizes reinforcement learning to learn optimal task assignment strategies. Our approach, called 'RL-TA', enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing task requirements and system dynamics. We evaluate RL-TA using a simulation-based approach and demonstrate its superiority over traditional task allocation methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system robustness. The proposed framework has applications in various domains, including robotics, smart grids, and autonomous vehicles.
