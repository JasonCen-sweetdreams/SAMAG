Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a given question. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) architecture for passage retrieval, which models the graph structure of the corpus and captures long-range dependencies between passages. Our approach leverages a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy, where the HGNN first identifies relevant clusters of passages and then refines the ranking within each cluster. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art passage retrieval performance, improving upon strong baselines by 12.5% in terms of recall@10.
