Biomedical information retrieval (BIR) systems often struggle to capture the nuances of domain-specific terminology, leading to suboptimal query results. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using word embeddings, tailored to the biomedical domain. Our method, BioQE, leverages pre-trained word2vec models to identify semantically related terms and incorporates them into the original query. We evaluate BioQE on the TREC 2019 CDS dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming traditional query expansion techniques. The proposed approach has the potential to enhance the accuracy and relevance of search results in biomedical information retrieval systems.
