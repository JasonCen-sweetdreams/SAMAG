Short-text documents, such as tweets and product reviews, pose significant challenges to information retrieval systems due to their limited context and vocabulary. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, dubbed 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to capture semantic relationships between words and expand query terms. We employ a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify relevant context words and weighted term embeddings to refine query representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and robustness to query ambiguity.
