Conversational search systems aim to retrieve relevant information through multi-turn dialogues. However, processing complex and context-dependent user queries remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel deep query reformulation approach, 'HierQR', which leverages hierarchical graph attention networks to model query semantics and contextual relationships. HierQR learns to identify key entities, intent, and semantic roles in the query and generates a refined, context-aware representation that improves retrieval performance. Experiments on a large conversational search dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HierQR in reducing query ambiguity and enhancing search accuracy.
