Coordinating multiple agents in complex, dynamic environments is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for multi-agent coordination. Our approach combines a high-level, graph-based policy for task assignment with low-level, deep Q-networks for individual agent control. We evaluate our method in a simulated warehouse management scenario, demonstrating improved coordination and task completion rates compared to traditional decentralized DRL approaches.
