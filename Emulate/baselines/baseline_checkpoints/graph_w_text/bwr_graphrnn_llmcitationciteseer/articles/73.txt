Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis, but its scalability is limited by the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, 'SparseHClust', which leverages sparse representations to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We introduce a hierarchical clustering framework that employes a sparse autoencoder to learn compact representations of the data, which are then clustered using a density-based clustering algorithm. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SparseHClust outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and scalability.
