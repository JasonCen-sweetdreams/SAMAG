Query optimization is a critical component of database systems, but traditional methods often struggle to adapt to dynamic workloads and large-scale distributed environments. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. We design a DRL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database environment and receiving rewards based on query execution time and resource utilization. Our experimental results on a simulated distributed database system show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
