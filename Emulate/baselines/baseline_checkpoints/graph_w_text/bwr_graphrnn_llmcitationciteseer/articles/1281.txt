Coordinating multi-agent systems is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning to enable effective coordination among agents. Our method, called HRL-Coord, consists of a high-level coordinator that learns to allocate tasks to agents and a set of low-level agents that learn to execute tasks using reinforcement learning. We conducted experiments in a simulated robotic soccer domain and demonstrated that HRL-Coord outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of coordination efficiency and task completion rate.
