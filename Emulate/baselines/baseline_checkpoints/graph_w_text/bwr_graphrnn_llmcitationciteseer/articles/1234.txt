Session-based search queries often lack contextual information, leading to ineffective query representations. We propose a novel approach, 'HGAT-Expand', which leverages hierarchical graph attention networks to model complex query relationships and expand the original query. Our method first constructs a hierarchical graph representing the query session, and then applies a graph attention mechanism to learn weighted representations of query terms. Experimental results on the TREC Sessions track dataset demonstrate that HGAT-Expand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of search ranking performance and relevance metrics.
