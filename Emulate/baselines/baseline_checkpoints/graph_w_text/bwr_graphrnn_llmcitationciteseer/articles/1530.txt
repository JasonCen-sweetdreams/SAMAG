Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in treating anxiety disorders by simulating real-world scenarios, but user engagement and emotional response remain significant challenges. This paper presents 'EmpathyBot', an embodied conversational agent (ECA) that employs nonverbal cues, emotional intelligence, and empathetic feedback to facilitate emotion regulation in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that EmpathyBot significantly increased user engagement, reduced anxiety, and improved emotional awareness compared to traditional VR exposure therapy. Our results inform the design of ECAs for mental health applications and highlight the potential of VR-based interventions for emotion regulation.
