In heterogeneous multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem due to varying agent capabilities, diverse task requirements, and decentralized decision-making. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework, 'HTA', which leverages graph neural networks to model agent and task relationships. HTA enables agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to dynamic task arrivals, ensuring efficient and scalable task allocation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HTA through extensive simulations, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.
