Knowledge graph search often relies on query expansion to improve retrieval performance. However, existing methods suffer from high computational costs and limited semantic understanding of query entities. We propose a novel approach, 'GraphExpan', which leverages deep graph embeddings to capture complex relationships between entities and expand queries effectively. Our method uses a graph neural network to learn entity representations, which are then used to generate expanded queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphExpan outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and efficiency.
