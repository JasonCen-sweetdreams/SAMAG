Conventional retrieval models often rely on static document representations, which fail to capture nuanced query semantics and contextual relationships. This paper presents a novel real-time document re-ranking framework, HQE-Rerank, which leverages hierarchical query embeddings to capture multi-level query intent. Our approach combines a coarse-grained query encoder with a fine-grained document encoder, enabling efficient and effective re-ranking of top-k retrieved documents. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that HQE-Rerank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of precision and recall, while reducing computational overhead by up to 30%.
