This paper presents EyeTribe, a novel gaze-based interface designed to improve reading comprehension in children. Our approach leverages eye-tracking technology to identify areas of difficulty in real-time, providing personalized feedback and guidance to young readers. We conducted a user study with 30 children aged 8-10 and found that EyeTribe significantly enhances reading comprehension scores compared to traditional reading methods. Furthermore, our interface was rated highly in terms of user experience and engagement. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of assistive technologies in education.
