Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of individuals with dyslexia. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing accessible conversational interfaces tailored to individuals with dyslexia. We conducted a mixed-methods study, involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing with 25 participants, to identify key challenges and preferences. Our findings inform the development of a set of guidelines and a prototype system that incorporates adaptive text-to-speech, phonetic-based error correction, and personalized feedback mechanisms. Results show significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to existing conversational interfaces.
