Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This study investigates the design of inclusive voice assistants for this demographic, focusing on multimodal interaction. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, exploring the effects of speech rate, tone, and visual feedback on task completion and user experience. Our results show that a slower speech rate and warm tone significantly improve task success, while visual feedback enhances user confidence. We provide design recommendations for creating more accessible voice assistants, highlighting the importance of inclusive design for older adults.
