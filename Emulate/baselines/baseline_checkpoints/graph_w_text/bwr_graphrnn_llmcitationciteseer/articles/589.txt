Traditional document ranking models often rely on handcrafted features and ignore the rich structural information present in document graphs. This paper proposes a novel context-aware document ranking framework, 'GRAPH- Rank', which leverages deep neural graph embeddings to capture semantic relationships between documents. We introduce a hierarchical graph attention mechanism that adaptively weights the importance of neighboring documents based on their contextual relevance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and ClueWeb09 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ranking accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
