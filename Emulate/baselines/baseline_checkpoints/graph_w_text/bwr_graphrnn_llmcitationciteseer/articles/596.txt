Boolean retrieval models are fundamental to many information retrieval systems, but their exact evaluation can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a neural approximation approach to efficiently estimate the retrieval scores of Boolean models. Our method, called Neural Boolean Approximation (NBA), leverages deep neural networks to learn a continuous representation of the Boolean query and document features. We demonstrate that NBA achieves significant speedups over exact evaluation while maintaining retrieval effectiveness. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that NBA outperforms state-of-the-art approximation methods and is robust to varying query complexities.
