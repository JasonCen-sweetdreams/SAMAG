Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that incorporates self-attention mechanisms to identify anomalous patterns in time-series data. Our approach enables feature-level and temporal-level explanations of the detected anomalies, providing insights into the decision-making process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while offering interpretable results.
