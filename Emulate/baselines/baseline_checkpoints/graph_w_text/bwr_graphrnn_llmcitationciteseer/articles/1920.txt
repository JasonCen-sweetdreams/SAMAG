Real-time information retrieval (IR) systems require efficient document filtering to combat information overload. This paper proposes an adaptive thresholding approach, 'AdaFilter', which dynamically adjusts the filtering threshold based on the query's semantic context. Our method leverages a deep learning-based query representation model to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and incorporates a feedback mechanism to refine the threshold over time. Experimental results on the TREC News Track dataset demonstrate that AdaFilter improves filtering accuracy by 12.5% and reduces latency by 30% compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
