Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but the role of embodiment in shaping user experience remains poorly understood. This study investigates how the level of embodiment in VR affects users' sense of presence, engagement, and cognitive load. We designed an experiment where participants performed a series of tasks in a VR environment with varying levels of embodiment, from simple controllers to full-body tracking. Our results show that increased embodiment leads to higher presence and engagement, but also increases cognitive load. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR system design and provide recommendations for optimizing the user experience.
