Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents must coordinate to optimize task execution. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to learn effective task allocation strategies. Our method, 'AgentCoor', uses a decentralized, multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to train agents to coordinate their actions and adapt to changing task dynamics. We evaluate AgentCoor on a simulated logistics scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization compared to traditional, hand-crafted allocation strategies.
