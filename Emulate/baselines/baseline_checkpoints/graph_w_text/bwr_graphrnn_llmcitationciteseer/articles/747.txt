Microblog retrieval poses unique challenges due to the brevity and noisy nature of tweets. This paper introduces 'DQE-Lite', a deep query expansion framework that leverages limited supervision to improve retrieval effectiveness. Our approach combines a neural query expansion module with a novel attention-based tweet representation model, enabling the capture of subtle semantic relationships between query terms and tweet contents. Experimental results on the TREC Microblog 2011-2014 datasets demonstrate that DQE-Lite outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 15% relative improvement in mean average precision.
