Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in building and maintaining large-scale knowledge graphs. However, existing approaches struggle to scale to massive graphs with millions of entities. This paper proposes a novel graph-based entity disambiguation framework, 'GEDGE', which leverages structural graph features and entity contextual information to disambiguate entities efficiently. We introduce a new graph attention mechanism that adaptively weights neighboring entities based on their relevance to the disambiguation task. Experimental results on three large-scale knowledge graphs demonstrate that GEDGE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
