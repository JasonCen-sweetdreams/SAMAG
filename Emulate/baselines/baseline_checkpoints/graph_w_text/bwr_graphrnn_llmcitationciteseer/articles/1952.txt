This paper addresses the problem of coordinating heterogeneous agents in complex systems, such as smart grids and traffic networks, to optimize resource allocation. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'Agent Harmony', which learns to coordinate agents with diverse capabilities and objectives. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and incorporates a hierarchical reward structure to balance individual and system-level goals. Experimental results on a real-world energy management scenario demonstrate that Agent Harmony outperforms traditional optimization methods and improves overall system efficiency by up to 25%.
