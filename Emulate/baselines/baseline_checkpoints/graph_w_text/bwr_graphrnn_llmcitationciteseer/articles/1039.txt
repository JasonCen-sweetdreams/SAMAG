Semi-supervised node classification on graph-structured data remains a challenging problem, especially when dealing with large, sparse graphs. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages both node features and structural information to improve classification accuracy. HGAN learns to selectively focus on relevant nodes and their neighborhoods, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains in accuracy and F1-score.
