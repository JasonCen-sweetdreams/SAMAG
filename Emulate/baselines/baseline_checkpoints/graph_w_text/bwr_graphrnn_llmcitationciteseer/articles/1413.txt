Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their emotional speech synthesis capabilities often neglect the needs of individuals with disabilities. This paper presents an exploratory study on designing inclusive voice assistants that can adapt to the emotional and social needs of users with disabilities. We develop and evaluate a novel emotional speech synthesis framework that incorporates disability-specific requirements, such as accommodating varying emotional intensity and speech patterns. Our user study with 30 participants from diverse disability groups demonstrates improved user satisfaction and emotional engagement with our proposed framework.
