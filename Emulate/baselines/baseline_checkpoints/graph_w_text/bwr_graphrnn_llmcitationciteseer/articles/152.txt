This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to improve learning outcomes. We design and evaluate a gesture-based interaction system that leverages the cognitive benefits of bodily engagement in learning. Our user study with 60 participants shows that the embodied interaction paradigm leads to significant improvements in knowledge retention and recall compared to traditional keyboard-and-mouse interfaces. We also identify key gestures and movement patterns that are correlated with successful learning outcomes, shedding light on the cognitive underpinnings of embodied cognition in VR.
