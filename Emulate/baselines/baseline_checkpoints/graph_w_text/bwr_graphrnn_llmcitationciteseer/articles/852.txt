Task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel approach to task allocation using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the agent-task interactions as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn a robust task allocation strategy that is resilient to agent failures and dynamic changes in the environment. Experimental results on a set of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and adaptability to changing conditions.
