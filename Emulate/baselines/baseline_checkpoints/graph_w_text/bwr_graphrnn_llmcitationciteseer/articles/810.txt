Dialogue systems often struggle to generalize across multiple domains and explain their responses. We propose a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) framework that addresses these limitations by modeling complex dialogue flows and incorporating domain-specific knowledge. Our approach leverages a novel attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant domain-specific contexts, enabling the model to generate more accurate and informative responses. We evaluate our approach on a multi-domain dialogue dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in response quality and explainability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
