Few-shot node classification remains a challenging problem in graph-based machine learning, where only a limited number of labeled nodes are available for training. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global graph structures to improve few-shot learning. HGAT uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant subgraphs and nodes, enabling the model to generalize better to unseen classes. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 12.5% on 5-shot node classification tasks.
