Unsupervised representation learning has seen significant advances with the rise of deep clustering algorithms. However, existing methods often struggle to scale to large datasets, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach, 'HierScale', which leverages a multi-resolution representation learning framework to efficiently discover clusters at varying granularities. By recursively applying a lightweight clustering module, HierScale achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while reducing computational cost by an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HierScale in unsupervised image classification and anomaly detection tasks.
