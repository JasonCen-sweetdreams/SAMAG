Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is a crucial task in various fields, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'TS-Anomaly', which leverages the strengths of autoencoders and convolutional neural networks to detect anomalies in high-dimensional time series data. TS-Anomaly uses a multi-scale convolutional architecture to capture temporal and spatial patterns in the data, followed by an autoencoder-based anomaly scoring mechanism. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that TS-Anomaly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
