Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but existing techniques often struggle with domain-specific terminology and scarce training data. This paper proposes a hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE', which leverages domain knowledge graphs and word embeddings to generate more informative and context-aware queries. HQE iteratively expands the query by incorporating relevant domain concepts, synonyms, and hypernyms, leading to significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall. Experimental results on a collection of biomedical and legal documents demonstrate the effectiveness of HQE in retrieving relevant documents, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 25%.
