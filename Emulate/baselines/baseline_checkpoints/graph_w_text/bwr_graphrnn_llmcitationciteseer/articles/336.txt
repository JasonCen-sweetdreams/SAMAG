Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics, but optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel graph-based indexing approach, dubbed 'Distributed Graph Index' (DGI), which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to efficiently optimize queries. DGI exploits the sparsity of query graphs to reduce the search space and employs a hierarchical indexing scheme to facilitate fast query execution. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that DGI outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
