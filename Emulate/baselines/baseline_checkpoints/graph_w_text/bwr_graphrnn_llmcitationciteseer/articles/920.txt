Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but existing VR systems often exclude people with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive VR experiences. We conducted participatory design workshops with individuals with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities to identify key accessibility barriers. We then developed and evaluated a set of novel VR interaction techniques, including eye-tracking-based navigation and haptic feedback, that cater to diverse abilities. Our results show that these techniques significantly improve user experience and engagement for participants with disabilities, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in VR.
