Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in processing graph-structured data. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning approach to generate targeted attacks on GNNs, leveraging the similarity in graph structures across different datasets. We introduce a graph attention mechanism to identify critical nodes and edges, and develop a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the attack strategy. Experimental results on multiple graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the performance of state-of-the-art GNN models, highlighting the need for robustness mechanisms in graph-based ML applications.
