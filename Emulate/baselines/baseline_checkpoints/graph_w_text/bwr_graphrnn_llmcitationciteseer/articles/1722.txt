Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train a deep reinforcement learning agent to learn an optimal policy for selecting the best execution plan. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
