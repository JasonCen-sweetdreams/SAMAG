The proliferation of IoT devices has led to increasingly complex network dynamics, necessitating adaptive resource allocation strategies. This paper proposes a novel cooperative agent-based framework, 'IoT-CoRA', which leverages decentralized decision-making and multi-agent coordination to optimize resource allocation in dynamic IoT networks. We introduce a hierarchical agent architecture that integrates machine learning-based predictive modeling and distributed constraint optimization techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that IoT-CoRA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of network throughput, latency, and energy efficiency.
