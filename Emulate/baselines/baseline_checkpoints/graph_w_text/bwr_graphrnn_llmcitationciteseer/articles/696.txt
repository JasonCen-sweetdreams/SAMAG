Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments often require forming coalitions to achieve complex tasks. However, existing approaches are limited by scalability and adaptability issues. This paper presents a novel distributed coalition formation algorithm, 'DCFA', that leverages local information exchange and adaptive decision-making to form efficient coalitions in real-time. We evaluate DCFA in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and coalition stability compared to centralized and static coalition formation methods.
