The proliferation of graph datasets has led to a surge in the development of distributed graph databases. However, the complexity of graph queries poses significant challenges to query optimization in these systems. This paper presents a novel optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph rewiring, query decomposition, and adaptive indexing to minimize query latency and resource utilization. We evaluate GraphOpt on a suite of real-world graph datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches.
