Conversational agents have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults, but existing systems often fail to account for their unique needs and abilities. This paper presents a participatory design approach to creating accessible conversational agents for older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, identifying key design requirements and preferences. Our findings inform the development of a prototype conversational agent that incorporates features such as simplified language, visual cues, and adaptive dialogue management. We evaluate the prototype through a usability study, demonstrating significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to existing systems.
