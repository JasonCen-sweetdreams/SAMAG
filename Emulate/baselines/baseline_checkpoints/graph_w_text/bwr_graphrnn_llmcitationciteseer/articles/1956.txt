As virtual reality (VR) technology continues to advance, understanding the role of embodiment in shaping user experiences is crucial. This study investigates how embodiment affects social presence in VR, a critical factor in social interactions and collaboration. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with either an embodied or non-embodied virtual agent, and measured social presence using a mixed-methods approach. Our results show that embodiment significantly enhances social presence, and that this effect is moderated by individual differences in anthropomorphism and spatial awareness. The findings have implications for the design of VR-based social interfaces and future research on human-computer interaction.
