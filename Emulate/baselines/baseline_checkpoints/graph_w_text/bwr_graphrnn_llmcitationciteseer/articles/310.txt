Multimedia retrieval systems often struggle to capture the complexity of user queries, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of both queries and documents. Our method, called 'NeuroQE', combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the visual and textual features of multimedia documents, respectively. Experimental results on a large-scale image dataset demonstrate that NeuroQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, improving mean average precision by up to 23.7%.
