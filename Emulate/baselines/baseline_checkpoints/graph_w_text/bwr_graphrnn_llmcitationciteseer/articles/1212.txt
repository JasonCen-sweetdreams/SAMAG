Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face significant challenges in efficiently retrieving relevant documents from large-scale, geographically dispersed repositories. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages semantic relationships between query terms to improve retrieval effectiveness. Our HQE method integrates a graph-based term clustering algorithm with a distributed indexing framework, enabling efficient query processing and document ranking. Experimental results on a large-scale DIR testbed demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall, while reducing query response times by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art methods.
