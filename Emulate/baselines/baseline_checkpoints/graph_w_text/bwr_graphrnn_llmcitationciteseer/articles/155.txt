Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their lack of personalization often excludes users with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop inclusive voice assistants that cater to diverse abilities. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, including individuals with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive impairments, to identify key challenges and preferences. Our findings inform the design of three personalization strategies: adaptive speech recognition, multimodal output, and customizable feedback mechanisms. We evaluate these strategies through a usability study, demonstrating significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates for users with disabilities.
