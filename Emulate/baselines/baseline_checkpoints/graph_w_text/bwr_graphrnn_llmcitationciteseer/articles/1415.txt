With the increasing adoption of virtual reality (VR) technology, providing effective feedback to users has become crucial for an immersive experience. This paper investigates the role of multimodal feedback (combining visual, auditory, and haptic cues) in enhancing user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study comparing three feedback conditions: unimodal visual, multimodal, and no feedback. Our results show that multimodal feedback significantly improves user performance and satisfaction in VR tasks, particularly for users with limited VR experience. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems and highlight avenues for future research.
