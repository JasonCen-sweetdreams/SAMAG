Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current VR interfaces often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents 'EchoVR', a novel VR interface designed specifically for users with visual impairments. EchoVR uses 3D audio cues, haptic feedback, and voice commands to enable users to navigate and interact with virtual environments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion times and user satisfaction compared to traditional screen-reader-based approaches. Our work contributes to the development of inclusive VR experiences that can benefit users with visual impairments.
