State-of-the-art neural ranking models for document retrieval often rely on complex architectures that may not generalize well to diverse query types. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based neural ranking framework, 'HANR', which models the hierarchical structure of documents and queries to improve retrieval accuracy. HANR employs a query-aware attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant document segments and a hierarchical aggregation strategy to capture both local and global contextual information. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HANR outperforms existing neural ranking models, especially for long-tail queries and documents with complex structures.
