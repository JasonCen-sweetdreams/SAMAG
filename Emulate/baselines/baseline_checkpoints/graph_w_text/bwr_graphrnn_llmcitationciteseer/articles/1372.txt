Passage retrieval is a crucial component of many information retrieval systems, but it can be computationally expensive and prone to suboptimal results. This paper introduces a novel query-driven document expansion approach, which selectively incorporates relevant terms from the top-retrieved documents to augment the original query. Our approach leverages a neural ranking model to predict the relevance of each document and identify the most informative terms. Experimental results on the MS MARCO dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves the retrieval efficiency while maintaining the accuracy of the top-ranked passages.
