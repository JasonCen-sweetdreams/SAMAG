Peer-to-peer (P2P) information retrieval (IR) systems have gained popularity due to their scalability and fault tolerance. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel distributed indexing framework, 'PeerIndex', which leverages a hierarchical indexing strategy to minimize query latency. We introduce a load balancing mechanism that dynamically reassigns indexing tasks based on node availability and query workload. Experimental results on a large-scale P2P IR system demonstrate that PeerIndex reduces query response time by up to 40% compared to existing indexing approaches.
