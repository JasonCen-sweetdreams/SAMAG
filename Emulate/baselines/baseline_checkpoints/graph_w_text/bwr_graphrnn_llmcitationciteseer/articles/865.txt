Real-time database systems require efficient concurrency control mechanisms to ensure predictable and reliable performance. This paper presents a novel multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) algorithm, 'RT-MVCC', which leverages a hybrid approach combining optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control techniques. RT-MVCC reduces the overhead of version management and abort handling, resulting in improved system throughput and responsiveness. Experimental evaluations on a real-time database benchmark demonstrate that RT-MVCC outperforms existing MVCC algorithms in terms of transaction latency and throughput under high-contention workloads.
