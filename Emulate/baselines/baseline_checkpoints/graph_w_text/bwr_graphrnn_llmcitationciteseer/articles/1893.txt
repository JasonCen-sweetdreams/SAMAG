Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of allocating resources efficiently to meet dynamic user demands. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'CloudOpt', which learns to optimize resource allocation in cloud data centers. CloudOpt leverages a hierarchical architecture consisting of a deep Q-network and a resource allocation policy, which adaptively adjusts to changing workload patterns and resource availability. Experimental results on a real-world cloud workload dataset demonstrate that CloudOpt achieves significant improvements in resource utilization, response times, and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art heuristics.
