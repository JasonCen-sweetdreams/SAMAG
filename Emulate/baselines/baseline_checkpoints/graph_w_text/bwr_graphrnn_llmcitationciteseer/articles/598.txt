Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges in interacting with computers. This paper presents EyeType, a novel gaze-based text entry system that leverages deep learning-based gaze estimation and probabilistic language modeling. EyeType achieves an average text entry rate of 15.6 words per minute with an accuracy of 92.5%, outperforming existing gaze-based systems. We also propose a novel calibration-free approach that adapts to individual eye movement patterns, ensuring high system usability. A user study with 12 participants with motor impairments demonstrates the effectiveness of EyeType in facilitating efficient and accurate text entry.
