Online index maintenance is crucial for high-performance transactional databases, as it directly impacts query latency and system throughput. This paper presents 'OIMax', a novel online index maintenance algorithm that leverages statistical models to predict update patterns and adaptively reorganize index structures. OIMax incorporates a novel cost model that accounts for the trade-off between index maintenance overhead and query performance. Experimental results on a real-world transactional workload show that OIMax outperforms state-of-the-art online indexing techniques by up to 30% in terms of query throughput and 25% in terms of index maintenance overhead.
