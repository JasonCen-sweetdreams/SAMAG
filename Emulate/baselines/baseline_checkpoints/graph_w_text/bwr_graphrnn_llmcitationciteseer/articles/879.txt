Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization that leverages machine learning and graph-based models to identify efficient query plans. Our approach, called 'DistOpt', uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group queries based on their characteristics and then applies a reinforcement learning framework to learn the optimal query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DistOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
