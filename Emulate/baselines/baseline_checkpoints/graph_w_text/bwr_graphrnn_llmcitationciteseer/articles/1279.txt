The rapid growth of digital information has led to an increased demand for efficient and scalable information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach for document filtering, which significantly reduces the computational overhead of traditional retrieval methods. Our model, called 'DocFilter', learns a hierarchical representation of documents and queries, enabling efficient filtering of irrelevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DocFilter achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computation time by up to 75%.
