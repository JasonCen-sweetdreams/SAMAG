Relation extraction (RE) from unstructured text is a fundamental task in natural language processing. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that learns to extract relevant relations by modeling entity interactions at multiple scales. HGAN incorporates a graph attention mechanism to selectively focus on informative entity pairs and a hierarchical aggregation strategy to capture complex relationships. Experimental results on the TACRED dataset demonstrate that HGAN outperforms existing RE models while providing transparent and explainable relation extraction.
