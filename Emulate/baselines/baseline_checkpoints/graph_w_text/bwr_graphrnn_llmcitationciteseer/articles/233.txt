Time series clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis, but existing methods struggle with large-scale datasets. This paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Embedding Clustering (HEC), which leverages deep learning to efficiently cluster time series data. HEC first learns a hierarchical representation of the data using a deep embedding network, and then applies a traditional clustering algorithm to the learned representation. Our experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HEC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale time series analysis.
