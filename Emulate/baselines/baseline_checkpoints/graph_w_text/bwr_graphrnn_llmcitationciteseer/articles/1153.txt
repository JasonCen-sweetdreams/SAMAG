Node classification in heterogeneous networks is a challenging task due to the varying node types and relationships. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages the hierarchical structure of networks to capture local and global dependencies. HGAT employs a multi-level attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges, enhancing the representation learning of nodes. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network models in node classification tasks, especially in networks with diverse node types and sparse connections.
