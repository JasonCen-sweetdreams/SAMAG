Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in data integration and retrieval, particularly in distributed databases where data freshness and consistency are paramount. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'EDIndex', which enables real-time entity disambiguation by efficiently indexing and querying large-scale datasets. EDIndex leverages a combination of Bloom filters, graph-based clustering, and parallel processing to reduce the computational overhead and improve the accuracy of entity disambiguation. Experimental results on a large-scale synthetic dataset demonstrate that EDIndex outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of accuracy.
