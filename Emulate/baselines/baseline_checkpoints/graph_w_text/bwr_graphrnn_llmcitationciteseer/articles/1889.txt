Multi-label node classification is a fundamental problem in graph-based data analysis, where each node can have multiple labels. Existing methods often suffer from label correlations and node feature heterogeneity. We propose a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages both node-level and graph-level attention mechanisms to capture complex dependencies between labels and nodes. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of macro-F1 score and label-wise accuracy, especially for nodes with multiple labels.
