Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively incorporate domain-specific knowledge, particularly when limited training data is available. This paper presents a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NQE-Lite', which leverages a compact, learnable knowledge graph to augment query representations. By incorporating a lightweight attention mechanism, NQE-Lite can adapt to diverse query types and domains, outperforming traditional query expansion methods on several benchmark datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NQE-Lite in improving retrieval performance, especially for tail queries, and discuss its potential applications in specialized search engines and recommender systems.
