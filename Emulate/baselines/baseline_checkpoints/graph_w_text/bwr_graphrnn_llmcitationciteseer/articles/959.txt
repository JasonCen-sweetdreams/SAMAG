Virtual reality (VR) has immense potential to enhance the lives of people with disabilities, but existing VR interfaces often neglect their needs. This paper presents an accessible VR interface framework, 'IncluVR', which integrates multimodal input mechanisms, personalized adaptive feedback, and real-time accessibility analytics. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants with disabilities, revealing significant improvements in user experience, task completion rates, and subjective satisfaction. Our approach enables VR systems to better accommodate diverse user needs, promoting inclusivity and equity in VR-based applications.
