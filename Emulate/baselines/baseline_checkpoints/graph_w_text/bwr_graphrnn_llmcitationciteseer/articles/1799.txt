Time-series forecasting with multivariate dependencies is a crucial task in various applications, including finance, healthcare, and climate modeling. However, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying relationships between variables. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to capture complex dependencies. Our approach enables interpretable forecasting by providing attention weights that highlight the most influential variables and time steps. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HAN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and interpretability.
