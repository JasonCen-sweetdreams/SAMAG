E-commerce product search often relies on simplistic query matching, leading to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE-Prod', which leverages deep learning to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and product attributes. HQE-Prod uses a novel attention-based neural network to generate a weighted set of expansion terms, which are then combined using a probabilistic scoring function. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HQE-Prod significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, improving mean average precision by 23.4% and reducing search latency by 15.6%.
