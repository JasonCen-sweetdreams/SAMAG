In multi-agent systems, negotiation is a crucial mechanism for agents to reach mutually beneficial agreements. However, when agents have incomplete information about each other's preferences and utilities, negotiation becomes a challenging problem. This paper proposes a decentralized negotiation strategy, 'InfoNeg', which leverages probabilistic modeling and Bayesian inference to reason about other agents' private information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of InfoNeg in various negotiation scenarios, showing improved agreements and faster convergence compared to existing decentralized negotiation protocols. Our approach has applications in autonomous vehicles, smart grids, and e-commerce platforms.
