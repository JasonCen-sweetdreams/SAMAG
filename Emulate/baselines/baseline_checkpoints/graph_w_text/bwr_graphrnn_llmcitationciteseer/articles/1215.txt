Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it helps to bridge the vocabulary gap between the user's query and the relevant documents. However, existing methods rely on manual feature engineering and often suffer from over-expansion. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based approach, 'RL-QE', which learns to select the most informative expansion terms by interacting with a simulated environment. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
