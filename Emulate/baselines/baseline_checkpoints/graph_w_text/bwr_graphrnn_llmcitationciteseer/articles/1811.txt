Effective task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities need to work together to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel graph attention network-based approach for coordinated task allocation, which learns to identify relevant agent-agent and agent-task relationships. Our method, called GATask, integrates task features, agent capabilities, and communication constraints to generate optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that GATask outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
