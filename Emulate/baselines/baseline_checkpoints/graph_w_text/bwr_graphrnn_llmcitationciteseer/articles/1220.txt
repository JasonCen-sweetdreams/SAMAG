Multi-agent systems often require coordination mechanisms to ensure efficient and fair decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized reputation system based on blockchain technology to facilitate trustful interactions among autonomous agents. Our approach leverages smart contracts to maintain a tamper-proof reputation ledger, enabling agents to evaluate the credibility of their peers and make informed decisions. We evaluate our system through simulations, demonstrating improved coordination outcomes and resistance to malicious behavior compared to traditional centralized reputation systems.
