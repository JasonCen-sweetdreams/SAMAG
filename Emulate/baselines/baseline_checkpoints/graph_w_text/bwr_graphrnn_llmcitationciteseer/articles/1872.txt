Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in education, but its effectiveness can be hindered by a one-size-fits-all approach. This study explores the role of personalization in VR learning environments, focusing on user engagement and learning outcomes. We designed a VR-based educational platform that incorporates user modeling, adaptive difficulty adjustment, and real-time feedback. Our user study with 120 participants reveals that personalized VR experiences lead to significant increases in engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention compared to non-personalized counterparts. We discuss implications for VR-based education and highlight avenues for future research.
