In multi-agent systems, trust is a critical component for effective task allocation. This paper proposes an adaptive trust mechanism, 'TrustAdapt', which dynamically updates trust values based on agent behavior and performance. TrustAdapt integrates reputation-based trust with a novel probabilistic trust model, allowing agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and optimize task allocation. We evaluate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing trust-based mechanisms.
