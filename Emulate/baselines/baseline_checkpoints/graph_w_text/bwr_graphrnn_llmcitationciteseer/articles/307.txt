Voice assistants have the potential to improve the independence and quality of life of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, existing systems often fail to account for the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an inclusive voice assistant, 'EasySpeak', which incorporates cognitive support features and personalized adaptation to facilitate successful interactions. Our user study with 20 older adults with MCI demonstrates that EasySpeak significantly reduces error rates and improves user satisfaction compared to a commercial voice assistant. The findings inform the development of more accessible and supportive voice interfaces for this growing demographic.
