Long-sequence time series forecasting is crucial in various applications, such as climate modeling and financial analysis. However, existing methods often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies and suffer from quadratic computational complexity. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention mechanism, 'HiAttn', which leverages a hierarchical representation of the input sequence to selectively focus on relevant segments. HiAttn reduces the computational complexity to linear while achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of HiAttn in forecasting tasks, including weather and stock price prediction.
