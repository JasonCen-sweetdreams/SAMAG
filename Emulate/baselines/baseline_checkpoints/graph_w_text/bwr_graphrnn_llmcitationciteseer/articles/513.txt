Autonomous urban traffic control aims to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that incorporates attention mechanisms to handle complex urban traffic dynamics. Our approach, called HART, consists of a high-level policy that selects traffic signal control strategies and a low-level policy that adjusts signal timings. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HART on a realistic simulation platform, showcasing improved traffic efficiency and reduced congestion compared to state-of-the-art methods.
