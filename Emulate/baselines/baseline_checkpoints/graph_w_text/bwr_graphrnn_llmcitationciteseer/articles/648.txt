The increasing scale of modern datasets has led to a growing need for efficient parallel processing in distributed database systems. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ParaOpt', which leverages a graph-based representation of query plans to identify opportunities for parallel execution. By incorporating a cost-based optimization algorithm and a dynamic task scheduling strategy, ParaOpt achieves significant performance improvements over existing optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world cluster setup demonstrate that ParaOpt reduces query execution times by up to 45% for complex analytical workloads.
