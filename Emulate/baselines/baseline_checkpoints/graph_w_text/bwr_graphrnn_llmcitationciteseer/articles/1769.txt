E-commerce product search often relies on query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. However, existing methods typically employ rule-based or probabilistic approaches, which may not capture complex semantic relationships between queries and products. This paper proposes a deep learning-based query expansion framework, 'DeepQE', which leverages a transformer-based architecture to learn query and product embeddings. We introduce a novel attention mechanism that selectively incorporates relevant product attributes into the expansion process. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision.
