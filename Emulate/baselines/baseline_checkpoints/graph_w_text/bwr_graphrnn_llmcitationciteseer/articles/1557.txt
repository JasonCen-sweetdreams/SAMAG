Optimizing queries in star-schema data warehouses is crucial for efficient decision-making. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which often fall short in handling complex queries. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach, 'LearnOpt', which leverages query execution logs to predict optimal execution plans. We design a graph neural network that captures the structural dependencies between query operators and data distributions, enabling LearnOpt to generalize well to unseen queries. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that LearnOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 3.5x in terms of query execution time, making it a promising solution for large-scale data analytics.
