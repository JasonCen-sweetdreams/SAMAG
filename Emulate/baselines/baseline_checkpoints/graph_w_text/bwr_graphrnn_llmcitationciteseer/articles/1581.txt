Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but older adults often struggle to use them due to limitations in speech recognition, dialogue flow, and cognitive demands. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create inclusive voice assistants tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted co-design workshops with 15 older adults and 5 caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise language, simple navigation, and personalized support. We propose a set of design guidelines and a prototype voice assistant, 'ElderAssist', which incorporates these insights. Our evaluation with 20 older adults shows significant improvements in usability, satisfaction, and perceived accessibility.
