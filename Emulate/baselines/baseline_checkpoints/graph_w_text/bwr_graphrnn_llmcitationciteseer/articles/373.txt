The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential increase in sensor data, posing significant challenges for real-time analytics. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'RT-Index', which leverages a combination of in-memory caching, prefix-compression, and probabilistic indexing to achieve efficient query processing on high-volume sensor streams. Our approach reduces query latency by up to 75% compared to existing indexing techniques, while maintaining a low memory footprint. We evaluate RT-Index on a large-scale industrial IoT dataset, demonstrating its applicability in real-world scenarios.
