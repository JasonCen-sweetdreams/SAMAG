Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is a challenging task, particularly when dealing with large datasets. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical contrastive learning framework, 'HiCAD', which leverages the strengths of both self-supervised learning and anomaly detection. HiCAD employs a hierarchical clustering approach to group similar time series segments, and then applies contrastive learning to learn robust representations that distinguish normal patterns from anomalies. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiCAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
