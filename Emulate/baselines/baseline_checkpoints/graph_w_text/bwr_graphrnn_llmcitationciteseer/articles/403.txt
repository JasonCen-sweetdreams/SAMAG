Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in constructing large-scale knowledge graphs, but existing methods struggle to handle the complexity and scalability of real-world datasets. This paper presents a novel approach, GraphDE, which leverages graph-based embeddings to model the semantic relationships between entities and their contexts. By incorporating a hierarchical attention mechanism, GraphDE can effectively capture long-range dependencies and disambiguate entities with high accuracy. Experimental results on two large-scale knowledge graphs demonstrate that GraphDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, while maintaining a linear computational complexity.
