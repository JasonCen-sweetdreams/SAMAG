Traffic signal control is a challenging problem in urban planning, requiring real-time adaptation to dynamic traffic patterns. We propose a multi-agent system that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize traffic signal timing. Our approach, called MARL-TSC, consists of multiple agents, each controlling a traffic signal, which learn to coordinate their actions to minimize travel time and reduce congestion. We evaluate MARL-TSC using a realistic traffic simulator and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional fixed-time and adaptive signal control methods. Our results show that MARL-TSC can reduce travel time by up to 23% and decrease congestion by 18% during peak hours.
