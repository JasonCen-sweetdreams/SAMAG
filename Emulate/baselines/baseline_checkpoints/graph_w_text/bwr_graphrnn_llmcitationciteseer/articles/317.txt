The increasing volume of data has led to a surge in information retrieval (IR) queries, posing significant challenges to query efficiency. This paper presents an adaptive indexing approach, QueryScalpel, that dynamically optimizes index structures based on query patterns and data distributions. Our approach leverages a reinforcement learning framework to learn the most effective indexing strategy, achieving up to 3.5x query speedup and 2x storage reduction compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques. Experimental results on a large-scale web dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of QueryScalpel in improving query efficiency and scalability.
