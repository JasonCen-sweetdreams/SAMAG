This paper presents a novel holonic agent-based architecture for decentralized resource allocation in smart grids. The proposed framework leverages the concept of holons to model complex energy distribution systems, enabling autonomous decision-making and adaptability to changing environmental conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study on a real-world smart grid scenario, showcasing improved resource allocation efficiency and reduced energy losses compared to traditional centralized control strategies.
