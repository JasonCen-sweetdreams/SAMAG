Virtual reality (VR) technology has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information. However, navigation in VR environments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents EyeGazePath, a novel gaze-based navigation system that utilizes eye-tracking technology to enable users to navigate through virtual spaces more efficiently. Our system leverages machine learning algorithms to predict user intent and provide personalized navigation paths. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of EyeGazePath and found significant improvements in navigation time, accuracy, and user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based navigation methods.
