Coordinated exploration is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to efficiently explore an environment while avoiding redundant actions. This paper proposes a novel graph-based planning approach, 'AdaptGraph', which adaptively constructs a graph representation of the environment and allocates agents to explore different regions. We introduce a probabilistic model that updates the graph structure based on the agents' observations, enabling them to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that AdaptGraph outperforms existing methods in terms of exploration efficiency and communication overhead.
