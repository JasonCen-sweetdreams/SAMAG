Passage retrieval is a crucial component of many natural language processing applications, but its efficiency is often hindered by the high dimensionality of document representations. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document representation learning (QADRL) framework that learns to adaptively compress and refine document embeddings based on the query context. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder architecture with a query-aware attention mechanism, enabling efficient passage retrieval while maintaining retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of QADRL in reducing retrieval latency while improving recall and MRR scores.
