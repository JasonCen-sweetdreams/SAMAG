Predicting protein-ligand binding affinities is a crucial task in drug discovery and design. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) model that leverages the protein-ligand interaction graph to predict binding affinities. Our model employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on critical protein-ligand interactions, and incorporates graph convolutional layers to capture local and global structural patterns. Experimental results on the PDBbind dataset demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean absolute error and Pearson correlation coefficient.
