Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for various applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', specifically designed for column-store databases. ColOpt utilizes a combination of machine learning-based predicate selectivity estimation and a novel cost model that takes into account the column-store layout. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that ColOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average query speedup of 3.2x. Furthermore, we show that ColOpt can effectively handle high-dimensional data and large-scale datasets.
