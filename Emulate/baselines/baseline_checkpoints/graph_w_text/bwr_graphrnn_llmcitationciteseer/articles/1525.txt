Real-time traffic management poses significant challenges due to the complexity and dynamics of urban transportation networks. This paper proposes a novel distributed agent-based decision support system (D-ABDSS) that leverages multi-agent systems and distributed computing to optimize traffic signal control and routing. The D-ABDSS framework consists of autonomous agents that cooperate to minimize travel times, reduce congestion, and improve traffic safety. We evaluate the system using real-world traffic data from San Francisco, demonstrating significant improvements in traffic flow and reductions in travel times compared to traditional centralized approaches.
