Gesture-based interfaces have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but users with motor impairments often struggle to use these systems. This paper presents a novel approach to designing inclusive gesture-based interfaces that cater to users with varying motor abilities. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 participants with motor impairments, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed framework, ' GestureAid', incorporates personalized gesture recognition, adaptive feedback, and compensatory strategies to enhance accessibility. Evaluations with 30 participants demonstrate significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user experience.
