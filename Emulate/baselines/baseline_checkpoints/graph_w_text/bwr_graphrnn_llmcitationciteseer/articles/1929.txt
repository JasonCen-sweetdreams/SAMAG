Explainable recommendation systems have garnered significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages graph-based representation learning to model complex relationships between users, items, and their attributes. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant graph structures to generate interpretable recommendations. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
