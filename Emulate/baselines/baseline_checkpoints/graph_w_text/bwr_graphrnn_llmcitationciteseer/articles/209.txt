Distributed database systems face significant performance challenges due to complex query optimization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, 'RL-QO'. By modeling query optimization as a Markov decision process, RL-QO learns to adapt to dynamic query workloads and optimize query execution plans. We evaluate RL-QO on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query throughput and latency compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers. Our results show that RL-QO can effectively scale to large distributed systems and provide robust performance under varying workloads.
