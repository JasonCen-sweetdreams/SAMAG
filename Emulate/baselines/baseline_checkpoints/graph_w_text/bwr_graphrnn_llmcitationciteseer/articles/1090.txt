Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based neural network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of each modality to recognize emotions more accurately. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific encoders, a multi-modal fusion module, and a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weighs the importance of each modality. Experiments on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal inputs.
