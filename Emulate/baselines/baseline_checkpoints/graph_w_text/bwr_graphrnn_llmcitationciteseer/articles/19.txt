Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human life, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of personalized avatar representation on user involvement and experience in VR environments. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment involving 120 participants, who interacted with either a personalized or a generic avatar in a VR game. Our results show that users with personalized avatars reported higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and emotional arousal, and demonstrated improved performance in the game. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR system design and potential applications in education, entertainment, and therapy.
