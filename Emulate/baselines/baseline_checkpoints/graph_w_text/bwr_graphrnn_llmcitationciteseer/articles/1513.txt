Traditional document retrieval systems rely on keyword matching, neglecting the semantic context of user queries. This paper presents a novel approach to document retrieval, leveraging latent semantic analysis (LSA) to capture the contextual relationships between words. We propose a multi-graph neural network (MGN) model that incorporates both local and global context, enabling more accurate query-document matching. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall.
