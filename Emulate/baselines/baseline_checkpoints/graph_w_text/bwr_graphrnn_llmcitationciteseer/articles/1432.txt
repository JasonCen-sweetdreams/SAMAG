In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem due to the complexity of agent interactions and task dependencies. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep graph reinforcement learning to coordinate task allocation among agents. Our method, called GraphMAT, represents the agent-task graph as a Markov decision process and learns a policy to allocate tasks that maximizes system efficiency and minimizes conflicts. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that GraphMAT outperforms existing approaches in terms of task completion rate and agent utilization.
