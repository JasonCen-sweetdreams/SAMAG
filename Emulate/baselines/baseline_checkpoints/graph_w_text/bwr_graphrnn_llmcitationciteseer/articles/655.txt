Distributed databases have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in such systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize query performance by adaptively sampling the data distribution. Our method, called 'AdaSample', dynamically adjusts the sample size based on the query's selectivity and the underlying data distribution. We demonstrate that AdaSample outperforms existing sampling-based query optimization techniques in terms of query latency and accuracy, while also reducing the overhead of data transfer and processing.
