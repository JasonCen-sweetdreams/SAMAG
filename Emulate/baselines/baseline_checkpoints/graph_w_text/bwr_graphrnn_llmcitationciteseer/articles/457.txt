Materialized aggregates are crucial for accelerating query performance in column-store databases. However, maintaining these views incrementally in the presence of continuous data updates poses significant challenges. This paper presents a novel approach, 'IVM-C', which leverages the column-store layout to minimize the overhead of incremental view maintenance. IVM-C employs a hybrid strategy that combines batch processing with micro-batching to achieve efficient and adaptive maintenance of materialized aggregates. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that IVM-C outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by up to 3x in terms of maintenance time and 2x in terms of query performance.
