This paper presents a novel approach to gesture recognition in augmented reality (AR) interfaces, focusing on adapting to individual users' motor patterns and preferences. We propose a machine learning-based framework that incorporates both kinematic and kinetic features from hand and finger tracking data. Our system, AR Gesture Adapt, employs a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize gesture recognition accuracy and user experience in real-time. Experimental results with 30 participants demonstrate significant improvements in gesture recognition rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches.
