Multi-agent systems (MAS) often operate in dynamic environments, where agents must adapt to changing circumstances to achieve their goals. This paper introduces a novel negotiation framework for MAS, which leverages machine learning to learn adaptive strategies for agents in dynamic environments. Our approach, called AdaptNeg, uses a hybrid approach combining reinforcement learning and game-theoretic analysis to enable agents to negotiate effectively in the face of uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptNeg significantly outperforms existing negotiation strategies in a variety of dynamic scenarios, including resource allocation and task assignment problems.
