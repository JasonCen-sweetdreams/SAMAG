Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complexity of patent documents and the ambiguity of query terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'Patent2Vec', which leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method uses a combination of word and patent embeddings to generate expanded queries that better match the intent of the user. Experimental results on a large patent dataset show that Patent2Vec significantly improves retrieval performance, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
