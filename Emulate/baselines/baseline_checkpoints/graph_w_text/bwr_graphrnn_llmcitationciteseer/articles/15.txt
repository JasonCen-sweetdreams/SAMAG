Query optimization is a crucial aspect of relational database management systems. Despite significant advances, existing indexing techniques often struggle to efficiently handle complex queries. This paper introduces SQL-Scalpel, a novel indexing technique that leverages machine learning-based pattern recognition to identify and optimize critical query paths. By dynamically adapting to query workloads, SQL-Scalpel reduces query latency by up to 40% and improves overall system throughput. We evaluate SQL-Scalpel using the TPC-H benchmark and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world database applications.
