Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize accessibility for individuals with disabilities. However, current VR interfaces often lack adaptability and accessibility features, limiting their usability. This paper presents a novel framework, 'AccessibleVR', which incorporates a range of adaptive and customizable interface elements to accommodate diverse user needs. We conducted a user study with participants with varying disabilities, demonstrating significant improvements in usability and user satisfaction compared to standard VR interfaces. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and accessible VR experiences.
