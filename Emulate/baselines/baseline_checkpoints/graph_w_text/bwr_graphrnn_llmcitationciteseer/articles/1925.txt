Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly prevalent in modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between data distribution, network latency, and query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query performance in DDS. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to adaptively adjust query execution plans based on real-time system conditions. Experimental results on a simulated DDS environment demonstrate that our RL-based approach achieves significant improvements in query response time and throughput compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
