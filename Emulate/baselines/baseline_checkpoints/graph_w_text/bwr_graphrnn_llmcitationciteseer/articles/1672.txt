Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with digital information. However, current VR systems often neglect the complex interplay between the user's body and the virtual environment. This paper presents an embodied cognition framework for VR, which incorporates gestural input, proprioceptive feedback, and spatial awareness to enhance user experience. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a user study, showing improved task performance, increased user engagement, and reduced cognitive load. Our findings have significant implications for the design of future VR systems, highlighting the importance of embodied cognition in creating immersive and intuitive interfaces.
