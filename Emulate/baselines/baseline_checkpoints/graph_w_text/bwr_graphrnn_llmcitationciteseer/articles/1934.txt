Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel neural-based approach, 'ContextEmb', which leverages contextualized embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and their surroundings. By integrating ContextEmb into a state-of-the-art retrieval framework, we demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance on several benchmark datasets, particularly in scenarios where the original query is ambiguous or contains out-of-vocabulary terms.
