Dynamic graph databases have become increasingly popular in modern applications, but their efficient indexing remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'GraphSprint', a novel indexing technique that leverages the graph's structural properties to support fast query execution. GraphSprint uses a combination of graph summarization, incremental indexing, and optimized query planning to achieve an average speedup of 3.5x over existing indexing methods. Our experimental evaluation on real-world graph datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of GraphSprint in supporting various graph queries, including node and edge insertions, deletions, and pattern matching.
