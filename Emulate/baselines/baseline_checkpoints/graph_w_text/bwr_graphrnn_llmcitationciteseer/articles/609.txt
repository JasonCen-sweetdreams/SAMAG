Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by accessibility barriers. This study investigates the impact of interface modality on the usability and user experience of voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study, comparing three interface modalities: voice-only, visual-only, and multimodal (combining voice and visual cues). Our results show that multimodal interfaces significantly improve task completion rates and user satisfaction, particularly for older adults with hearing or visual impairments. We provide design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants and discuss implications for future research.
