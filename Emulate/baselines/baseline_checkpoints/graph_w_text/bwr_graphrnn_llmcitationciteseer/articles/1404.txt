This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to decentralized multi-agent task allocation in dynamic environments. We propose a novel framework, 'MALTA', which enables agents to learn task allocation strategies through interactions with their peers and the environment. MALTA utilizes a decentralized actor-critic architecture, where each agent learns to predict the task allocation outcomes and adjusts its strategy accordingly. Experimental results on a simulated search and rescue scenario demonstrate that MALTA achieves improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional, centralized approaches.
