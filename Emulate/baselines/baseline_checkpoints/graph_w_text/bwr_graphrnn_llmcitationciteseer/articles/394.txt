Touchless displays are increasingly popular in various applications, including public kiosks, smart home devices, and automotive systems. However, securing user authentication on these devices remains an open challenge. This paper investigates the feasibility of using gesture-based authentication on touchless displays. We design and implement a gesture-recognition system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. Our user study with 50 participants evaluates the system's performance under various conditions, including lighting variations, gesture complexity, and user familiarity. The results show that our approach achieves an average accuracy of 92.1% and outperforms existing authentication methods in terms of user experience and security.
