Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) to enhance the retrieval performance. Existing methods, however, often rely on simplistic word representations, neglecting the contextual nuances of query terms. We propose a novel approach, 'ContextEmb', which leverages context-aware word embeddings to better capture the semantic relationships between query words. By incorporating contextualized embeddings into a probabilistic retrieval framework, we demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness on several benchmark datasets. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, especially in scenarios with ambiguous or polysemous query terms.
