Column stores have become increasingly popular for analytical workloads due to their ability to efficiently store and query large amounts of data. However, real-time aggregation queries still pose a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'CAI', which leverages the characteristics of column stores to accelerate aggregation queries. CAI uses a combination of Bloom filters and bit-vector indexing to reduce the number of rows that need to be accessed during aggregation, resulting in significant performance improvements. Our experiments on a popular column store DBMS demonstrate that CAI outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 3x for real-time aggregation workloads.
