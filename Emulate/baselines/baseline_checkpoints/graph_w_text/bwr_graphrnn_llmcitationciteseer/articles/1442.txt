Existing document representation techniques in information retrieval (IR) often neglect the spatial relationships between query terms, leading to suboptimal ranking performance in ad-hoc retrieval tasks. This paper proposes a novel proximity-aware document representation framework, 'ProxRep', which incorporates term co-occurrence patterns and proximity features into a dense vector space. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProxRep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain, while requiring fewer computational resources.
