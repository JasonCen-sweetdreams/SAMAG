Few-shot learning has made significant progress in recent years, but most existing methods are limited to closed-set domain adaptation, where the target domain is known during training. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical few-shot learning framework, 'HierFA', that tackles the more challenging open-set domain adaptation problem, where the target domain is unseen during training. HierFA utilizes a hierarchical meta-learning strategy to learn domain-invariant representations and adapt to new domains with few labeled examples. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HierFA in adapting to novel domains and improving the robustness of few-shot learning models.
