Node classification in heterogeneous networks is a challenging task due to the varying node degrees, types, and relationships. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) architecture that addresses these challenges. HAGNN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture node-level, subgraph-level, and graph-level features, enabling effective node classification. We evaluate HAGNN on several real-world heterogeneous networks and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art graph neural network models, achieving an average improvement of 12.5% in F1-score.
