High-dimensional text data poses significant challenges to traditional clustering algorithms. This paper presents a novel hierarchical clustering approach, 'ADWISE', which adapts density-based methods to the inherent structure of text data. ADWISE employs an efficient node-splitting strategy that leverages local density estimates to identify clusters at varying scales. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ADWISE outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods in terms of clustering quality, robustness to noise, and computational efficiency.
