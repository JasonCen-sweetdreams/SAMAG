In distributed systems, efficient resource allocation is crucial for optimal system performance. This paper proposes an autonomous agent-based framework, 'AgentCoord', to coordinate resource allocation among agents in a decentralized manner. AgentCoord utilizes a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, where agents learn to negotiate and allocate resources based on local observations and feedback. We introduce a novel communication protocol that enables agents to share knowledge and adapt to changing system dynamics. Experimental results on a simulated distributed system demonstrate that AgentCoord outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of resource utilization and system throughput.
