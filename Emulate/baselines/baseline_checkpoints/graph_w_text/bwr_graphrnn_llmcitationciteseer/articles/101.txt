Virtual reality (VR) has shown immense potential in various domains, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of haptic feedback on user engagement in VR environments. We designed a VR game that incorporates multiple levels of haptic feedback, from basic vibrotactile to more sophisticated electroencephalography-based feedback. Our user study involving 30 participants reveals that haptic feedback significantly enhances user engagement, measured through metrics such as completion rate, time spent, and subjective experience. We also identify specific haptic feedback types that are more effective in different VR scenarios.
