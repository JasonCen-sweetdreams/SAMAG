Relevance feedback is a powerful technique for improving the accuracy of information retrieval systems. However, existing methods rely on manual user input, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach that leverages user feedback to automatically refine document filtering. Our model, called 'DeepRF', incorporates a hierarchical neural network that learns to encode user preferences from a small set of labeled examples. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepRF outperforms state-of-the-art filtering methods, achieving a 25% improvement in precision at the top-10 ranked documents.
