E-commerce search engines struggle to accurately retrieve relevant products due to the ambiguity of user queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to real-time query expansion using reinforcement learning. Our method, 'RL-QE', learns to automatically generate context-aware query expansions by interacting with the search engine and receiving feedback in the form of user click-through rates. We demonstrate the efficacy of RL-QE on a large-scale e-commerce dataset, showing significant improvements in search accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
