Virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) have become increasingly popular, but their security remains a concern. This paper presents a novel eye-gaze based authentication system for VR HMDs, which leverages the unique characteristics of eye movements to verify user identities. Our approach uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to analyze the user's gaze patterns, achieving an accuracy of 95.6% in a user study with 30 participants. We also discuss the trade-offs between security, user experience, and system complexity, providing guidelines for the design of secure and usable VR authentication systems.
