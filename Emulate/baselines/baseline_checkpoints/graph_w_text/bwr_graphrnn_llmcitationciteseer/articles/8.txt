Node classification in heterogeneous graphs is a challenging task due to the presence of multiple node types and edge relationships. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages the graph structure to learn node representations. HGAT uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant neighbors and edge types, enabling the model to capture complex relationships between nodes. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art node classification methods, particularly in graphs with high heterogeneity.
