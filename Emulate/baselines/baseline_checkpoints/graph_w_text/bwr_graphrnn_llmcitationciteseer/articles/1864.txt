Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often rely on query expansion to improve retrieval effectiveness. However, existing methods struggle to capture complex contextual relationships between query terms and relevant entities. We propose a novel approach, EntityEmbEx, which leverages neural entity embeddings to enrich query representations. By integrating entity embeddings with traditional query expansion techniques, our method achieves significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 Ad-Hoc Retrieval dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of EntityEmbEx, particularly for queries with low term frequency.
