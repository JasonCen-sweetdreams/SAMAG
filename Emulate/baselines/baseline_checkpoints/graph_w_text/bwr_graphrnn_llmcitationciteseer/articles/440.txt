E-commerce search engines rely on query suggestion to improve user experience. Existing methods often rely on supervised learning, which requires expensive annotation and may not generalize well to unseen queries. This paper proposes 'HRL-QS', a novel unsupervised query suggestion framework that leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning. HRL-QS learns to identify relevant query suggestions by maximizing a reward function that balances search result relevance and diversity. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HRL-QS outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised baselines, while reducing annotation costs.
