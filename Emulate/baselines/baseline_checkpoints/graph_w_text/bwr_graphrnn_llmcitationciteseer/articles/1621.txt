The use of personalized avatars in virtual reality (VR) gaming has gained significant attention in recent years. However, there is a lack of understanding of how these avatars impact user engagement. This paper presents a study that investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR gaming. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR game with varying levels of avatar personalization. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, particularly among players who strongly identify with their avatars. We also found that the level of personalization affects user behavior, with more personalized avatars leading to increased exploration and social interaction.
