Traditional search engines rely on exact keyword matching, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Neural Ranking (HNR) model for efficient document filtering. HNR leverages a two-stage architecture, where a coarse-grained neural filter eliminates irrelevant documents, followed by a fine-grained ranking module that refines the search results. We demonstrate the efficacy of HNR on several benchmark datasets, showcasing significant improvements in retrieval precision and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
