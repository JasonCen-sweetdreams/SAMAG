As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the factors that influence user engagement is crucial. This study investigates the effect of haptic feedback on user experience in VR interfaces. We designed a controlled experiment wherein participants performed a series of tasks with and without haptic feedback. Our results show that the inclusion of haptic feedback significantly enhances user engagement, as measured by both subjective self-reporting and objective metrics such as task completion time and accuracy. We also explore the role of individual differences in haptic perception and discuss implications for the design of VR systems.
