Traditional query expansion techniques often struggle with heterogeneous document collections, where diverse formats and modalities hinder effective retrieval. We propose a novel deep learning-based approach, 'HetQEx', which leverages multimodal embeddings to expand queries and adapt to the collection's heterogeneity. Our method incorporates a dynamic weighting scheme to balance the contributions of different modalities and reduce the impact of noisy or irrelevant features. Experimental results on a large-scale, heterogeneous document collection demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency over state-of-the-art baseline methods.
