Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to enhance the daily lives of older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing AR interfaces are often inaccessible to this population due to their complex design and high cognitive demands. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible AR interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to inform the design of our AR system, which incorporates simple and intuitive interactions, audio cues, and personalized assistance. Our evaluation results show that our system significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional AR interfaces.
