Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but existing methods often struggle with scalability and capturing complex relationships. We propose HAGCN, a hierarchical attention graph convolutional network that leverages self-attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant neighboring nodes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets, including ogbn-arxiv and ogbn-products, while reducing computational complexity by up to 50% compared to existing GNN-based methods. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of HAGCN in real-world applications, such as user profiling and recommender systems.
