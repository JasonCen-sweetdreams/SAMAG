Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their conversational style often lacks personalization, leading to user frustration. This paper investigates the impact of personality traits on user experience with voice assistants. We conducted a user study with 100 participants, analyzing their interactions with a voice assistant designed to exhibit different personality traits (e.g., extraverted, agreeable, conscientious). Our results show that users with certain personality traits (e.g., introverted, neurotic) prefer a more reserved, empathetic conversational style. We propose a novel framework for designing inclusive voice assistants that adapt to individual personality traits, enhancing user satisfaction and accessibility.
