Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve access to information and experiences for individuals with visual impairments. However, the lack of tactile feedback in VR environments can hinder user engagement and navigation. This paper presents a novel adaptive haptic feedback system, 'HapticGuide', designed to provide personalized tactile cues to users with visual impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, comparing HapticGuide to traditional audio-based feedback. Results show significant improvements in navigation efficiency, user satisfaction, and reduced cognitive load with HapticGuide. Our findings have implications for the development of inclusive VR experiences.
