Virtual assistants (VAs) have transformed human-computer interaction, but their lack of emotional intelligence hinders their effectiveness for people with disabilities. This paper presents an emotionally intelligent VA framework, 'EmpaVA', which incorporates affective computing, natural language processing, and machine learning to recognize and respond to users' emotional states. We conducted a user study with 30 participants with disabilities, demonstrating that EmpaVA significantly improves user satisfaction, trust, and task completion rates compared to traditional VAs. Our findings inform the design of more empathetic and inclusive VAs.
