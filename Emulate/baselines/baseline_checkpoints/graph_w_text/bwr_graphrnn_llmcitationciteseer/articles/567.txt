Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing complex relationships between data entities. However, query optimization for graph databases remains a challenging problem, especially for large-scale graphs. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a neural network-based agent that learns to select optimal query execution plans based on graph characteristics and query patterns. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
