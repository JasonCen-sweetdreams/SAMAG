The proliferation of IoT devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper introduces a novel approach to adaptive resource allocation using self-organizing agent networks. Our framework, SOAR, leverages decentralized decision-making and multi-agent coordination to optimize resource utilization in dynamic IoT environments. We evaluate SOAR through simulations and experiments on a real-world IoT testbed, demonstrating improved resource allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional centralized approaches.
