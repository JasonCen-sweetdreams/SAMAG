This paper presents a decentralized autonomous agent framework for real-time traffic management, which leverages multi-agent systems to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. Our framework, 'TrafficAgent', utilizes a novel distributed decision-making approach that enables agents to adapt to changing traffic conditions and communicate with each other in real-time. We evaluate TrafficAgent using a large-scale simulation of a metropolitan area and demonstrate significant reductions in travel time and traffic congestion compared to traditional centralized traffic management systems.
