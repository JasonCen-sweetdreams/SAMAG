This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize task assignment and execution. We introduce a hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) to model agent interactions and task dependencies, enabling agents to learn distributed policies that adapt to dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization, making it suitable for real-world applications such as autonomous robotics and smart cities.
