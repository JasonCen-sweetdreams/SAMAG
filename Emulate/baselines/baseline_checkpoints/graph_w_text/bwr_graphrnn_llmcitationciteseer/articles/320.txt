Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to rank documents relevant to a given query. While neural ranking models have shown promising results, they often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural network architecture, 'HierRank', which leverages a hierarchical representation of documents to reduce computational complexity while improving ranking effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of both efficiency and retrieval quality.
