Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but existing VR systems often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences, focusing on haptic and auditory feedback mechanisms. We conduct a user study with 20 visually impaired participants, evaluating the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing user engagement and navigation. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction, highlighting the potential of our framework to promote inclusive VR design.
