Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in older adults' daily lives, but their lack of emotional intelligence can lead to user frustration and mistrust. This study investigates the impact of emotion-aware voice assistants on trust and perceived empathy in older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, aged 65-85, who interacted with either an emotion-aware or a standard voice assistant. Results show that the emotion-aware assistant significantly improved user trust and perceived empathy, particularly among participants with higher levels of anxiety and depression. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing more empathetic and supportive voice assistants for older adults.
