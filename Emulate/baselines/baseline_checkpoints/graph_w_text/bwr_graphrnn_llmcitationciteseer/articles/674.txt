Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents need to coordinate to achieve global objectives. This paper proposes a novel negotiation-based distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) framework for task allocation. Our approach leverages local negotiation protocols and constraint propagation to efficiently allocate tasks to agents, while ensuring global constraints are satisfied. We evaluate our approach on a realistic robotics scenario, demonstrating improved scalability and solution quality compared to centralized optimization methods.
