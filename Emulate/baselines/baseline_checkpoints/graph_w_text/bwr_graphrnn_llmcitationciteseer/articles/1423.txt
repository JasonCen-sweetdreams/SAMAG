Virtual reality (VR) systems are increasingly being used in various domains, but traditional input methods can hinder the overall user experience. This paper explores the use of gaze-based interaction as a natural and intuitive interface for VR environments. We conducted a user study to investigate the effects of gaze-based interaction on user experience, eye movement patterns, and task performance. Our results show that gaze-based interaction significantly improves user satisfaction and reduces eye movement complexity compared to traditional controller-based input. We also identify key factors influencing gaze behavior in VR, including visual attention and cognitive load.
