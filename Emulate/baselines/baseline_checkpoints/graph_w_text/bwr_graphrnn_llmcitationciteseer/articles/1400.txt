Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in information retrieval (IR) systems, aiming to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. This paper presents a novel QE approach, leveraging deep learning-based semantic graph embeddings to model complex relationships between query terms and concepts. Our proposed method, GraphQE, incorporates a heterogeneous graph neural network to jointly learn query and document representations, enabling more effective term weighting and expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming state-of-the-art QE techniques.
