Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution in DDS remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive query optimization approach, 'AQORL', that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans. AQORL uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on real-time system workload, data distribution, and query patterns. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that AQORL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x and reducing query latency by 30%.
