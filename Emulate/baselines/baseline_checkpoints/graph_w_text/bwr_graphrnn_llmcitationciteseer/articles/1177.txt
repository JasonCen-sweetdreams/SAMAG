Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization that leverages workload-aware partitioning to minimize resource contention among tenants. Our method, called 'PartiOpt', uses machine learning-based workload forecasting to dynamically adjust partitioning schemes and optimize query plans. Experimental results on a real-world cloud database show that PartiOpt reduces average query latency by up to 35% and improves resource utilization by 25% compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
