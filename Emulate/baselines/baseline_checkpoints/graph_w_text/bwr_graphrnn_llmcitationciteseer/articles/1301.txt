The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosive growth in edge-generated data, making real-time analytics a critical component of many applications. However, existing query optimization techniques are inadequate for edge computing environments, where resources are limited and latency is paramount. This paper presents 'ECHO', a novel distributed query optimization framework designed specifically for edge computing. ECHO leverages a hierarchical clustering approach to partition the query graph, enabling efficient query processing and minimizing network latency. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world edge computing platform demonstrates that ECHO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
