The increasing volume and velocity of time-series data pose significant challenges to traditional indexing techniques in distributed database systems. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'TS-Index', designed to efficiently support real-time querying and analytics workloads. TS-Index leverages a hierarchical, partitioned indexing structure that adapts to the underlying data distribution and query patterns. Experimental evaluations on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that TS-Index achieves up to 5x faster query response times and reduces storage overhead by 30% compared to existing indexing solutions.
