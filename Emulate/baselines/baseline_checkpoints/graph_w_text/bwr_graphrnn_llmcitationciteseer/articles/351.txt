This paper presents a novel multi-agent system (MAS) architecture for real-time traffic management. We propose a hierarchical framework where agents at different levels of abstraction collaborate to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. Our approach leverages advanced sensing technologies and distributed optimization algorithms to scale up to large urban networks. Evaluation on a simulated traffic network demonstrates significant improvement in travel times and reduced congestion compared to traditional centralized approaches. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities of integrating MAS with emerging transportation technologies such as autonomous vehicles.
