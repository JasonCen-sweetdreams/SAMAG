Distributed systems face significant challenges in efficiently retrieving relevant documents from large-scale repositories. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical semantic indexing (HSI) approach that leverages both local and global context to improve document retrieval performance. Our method utilizes a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group semantically similar documents, followed by a distributed indexing scheme that reduces query latency. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HSI outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in terms of precision, recall, and query response time.
