Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle with indexing and querying large document collections, leading to slow response times. We propose a novel hierarchical document representation, HDRep, which leverages a combination of semantic and syntactic features to capture document structure and content. HDRep enables efficient indexing and querying by facilitating the pruning of irrelevant documents at multiple levels of granularity. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate that HDRep achieves a 30% reduction in query latency while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy to state-of-the-art methods.
