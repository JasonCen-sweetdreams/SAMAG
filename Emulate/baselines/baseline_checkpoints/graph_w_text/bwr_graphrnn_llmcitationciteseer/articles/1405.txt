In multi-agent systems, trust and reputation models play a crucial role in facilitating cooperation and preventing malicious behavior. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'AdaptTrust', which integrates adaptive trust and reputation models to improve the coordination of autonomous agents. Our approach leverages probabilistic graphical models to capture the uncertainty of agent interactions and adaptively updates trust values based on observed behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaptTrust outperforms traditional trust models in dynamic environments, achieving higher cooperation rates and improved system resilience.
