Ad-hoc retrieval remains a crucial information retrieval task, where query expansion (QE) is a key technique to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'DNE QE', which leverages deep neural network-based document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between queries and documents. Our method first generates a dense query representation using a pre-trained language model, and then uses a neural ranking model to select the most relevant expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DNE QE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
