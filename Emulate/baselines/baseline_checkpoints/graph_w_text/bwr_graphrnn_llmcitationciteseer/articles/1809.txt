Data integration across distributed databases is a crucial task in modern data processing. However, it is often hindered by the complexity of data heterogeneity and the lack of scalable integration methods. This paper proposes a novel approach to data integration using multi-resolution histograms (MRHs), which enables efficient and scalable data integration across distributed databases. MRHs allow for flexible data representation at multiple resolutions, enabling efficient data summarization and integration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on real-world datasets, showcasing improved data integration performance and reduced computational overhead.
