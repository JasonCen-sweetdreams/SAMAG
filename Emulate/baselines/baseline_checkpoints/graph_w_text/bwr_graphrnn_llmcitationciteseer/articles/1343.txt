Efficient task allocation is crucial for multi-agent systems, but centralized approaches can be brittle and vulnerable to single points of failure. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to enable autonomous agents to adaptively allocate tasks based on their capabilities and environmental conditions. We introduce a novel algorithm, 'DARA', which utilizes a decentralized Q-learning approach to optimize task allocation in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate that DARA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and robustness to agent failures.
