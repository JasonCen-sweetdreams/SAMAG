This paper presents a novel approach to designing gesture-based interfaces that are accessible and usable by individuals with motor disabilities. We conducted a series of user studies to identify the challenges faced by individuals with motor impairments when interacting with gesture-based systems. Based on our findings, we developed a set of design guidelines and a prototype system that incorporates machine learning-based gesture recognition, adaptive feedback, and personalized customization. Our evaluation results show significant improvements in user performance and satisfaction compared to existing gesture-based interfaces.
