Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies heavily on efficient passage retrieval from a large corpus. This paper proposes a novel sparse document representation method, 'SparsePass', which reduces the dimensionality of document embeddings while preserving their semantic meaning. We leverage a hierarchical clustering-based approach to identify and prune redundant dimensions, resulting in a 30% reduction in storage and a 25% speedup in passage retrieval time. Experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that SparsePass achieves comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art dense representations while significantly reducing computational resources.
