Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for generating efficient query plans. Our approach, called 'RL-Opt', outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of execution time and resource utilization. We evaluate RL-Opt on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate its scalability and robustness.
