Ad-hoc retrieval in heterogeneous document collections poses significant challenges due to the diverse nature of documents and user queries. This paper proposes a novel reinforced query expansion approach, 'RQE-HDC', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion for efficient retrieval. RQE-HDC incorporates a document similarity graph to capture complex relationships between documents and a query-dependent reward function to guide the expansion process. Experimental results on a large-scale heterogeneous dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
