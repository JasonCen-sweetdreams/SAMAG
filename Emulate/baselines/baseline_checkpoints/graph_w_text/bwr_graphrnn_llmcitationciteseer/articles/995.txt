Distributed database systems (DDS) are crucial for modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing query execution in DDS remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an adaptive query optimization (AQO) framework that leverages machine learning to dynamically adjust query execution plans based on real-time system performance metrics. AQO incorporates a novel cost-based optimization model that considers data distribution, network latency, and node availability. Experimental results on a large-scale DDS prototype demonstrate that AQO reduces query response times by up to 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
