This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) interaction design. We conducted a user study to investigate the effects of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load, user experience, and task performance in a VR environment. Our results show that incorporating embodied cognition principles into VR interaction design can significantly reduce cognitive load and improve user experience. We also identify key design recommendations for VR interface designers and provide implications for future research in this area.
