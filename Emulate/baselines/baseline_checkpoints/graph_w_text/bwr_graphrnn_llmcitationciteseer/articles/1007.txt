The increasing demand for real-time analytics in distributed database systems (DDS) necessitates efficient query optimization techniques. We propose 'RTOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages a combination of machine learning-based cost estimation and dynamic reordering of query operators to minimize response time. Our approach takes into account DDS-specific characteristics, such as node heterogeneity and network latency, to optimize query execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that RTOpt reduces average query response time by up to 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
