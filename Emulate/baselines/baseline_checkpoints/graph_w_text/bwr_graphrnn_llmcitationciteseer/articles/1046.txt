Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel neural passage retrieval approach, 'NeuPass', to enhance query expansion. NeuPass leverages a dense passage retriever to identify semantically similar passages, which are then used to expand the original query. We demonstrate that NeuPass outperforms traditional query expansion methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
