Effective traffic signal control is crucial for reducing congestion and improving urban mobility. This paper presents a novel hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'HMAC', for autonomous traffic signal control. HMAC consists of two levels: a high-level policy that coordinates the traffic signals at adjacent intersections and a low-level policy that optimizes the signal timing at each individual intersection. We evaluate HMAC using a realistic traffic simulator and demonstrate significant improvements in traffic flow and reduced congestion compared to traditional fixed-time and adaptive signal control strategies.
