In multi-agent systems, forming coalitions is a crucial task to achieve common goals. However, finding the optimal coalition structure is an NP-hard problem. This paper presents a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to distributedly form coalitions in multi-agent systems. We propose a decentralized, asynchronous algorithm that allows agents to learn effective coalition formation strategies through self-play. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model agent relationships and deep Q-networks to learn optimal coalition formation policies. Experimental results on various multi-agent scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in forming coalitions that achieve better system-wide performance compared to traditional methods.
