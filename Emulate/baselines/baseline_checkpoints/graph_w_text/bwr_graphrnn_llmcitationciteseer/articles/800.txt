Neural search engines have shown promising results in various information retrieval tasks. However, they often struggle with vocabulary mismatch, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal expansion strategies. Our approach, dubbed 'RL-QE', uses a neural agent to iteratively select expansion terms based on their expected reward, measured by the predicted relevance of the expanded query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
