Modern main-memory databases require efficient query processing to support real-time analytics. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'LIX', which leverages learned index structures to accelerate query execution. We introduce a hybrid indexing scheme that combines traditional B-tree indexing with machine learning-based indexing, exploiting the statistical properties of the data. Experimental results on a popular benchmark dataset demonstrate that LIX achieves an average query performance improvement of 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques, while maintaining similar storage overhead.
