Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the gap between the user's query and the relevant documents. While traditional methods rely on hand-crafted rules and heuristics, this paper explores the application of deep neural networks to learn query expansion strategies. We propose a novel architecture, 'QNLP', which leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent layers to capture both local and global patterns in the query and document representations. Experimental results on the TREC benchmark demonstrate that QNLP outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
