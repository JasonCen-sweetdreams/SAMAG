Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their conversational interfaces often exclude older adults with hearing or cognitive impairments. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the effects of personalized conversational strategies on the usability and accessibility of voice assistants for older adults. We designed and evaluated three novel strategies: slow-and-clear speech, semantic repetition, and turn-based dialogues. Our results show significant improvements in task completion rates, user satisfaction, and cognitive load reduction using these strategies. We also provide guidelines for designing inclusive voice assistants that cater to diverse older adult populations.
