Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have shown promise in personalized education, but often neglect the role of human gaze in learning. This paper presents 'EyeGuide', a novel ITS that leverages gaze-tracking technology to infer students' cognitive states and adapt instructional content accordingly. Our system uses machine learning-based gaze pattern analysis to detect instances of confusion, boredom, or engagement, and responds with targeted interventions to improve learning outcomes. A user study with 120 participants demonstrates significant improvements in student understanding and satisfaction when using EyeGuide compared to traditional ITSs.
