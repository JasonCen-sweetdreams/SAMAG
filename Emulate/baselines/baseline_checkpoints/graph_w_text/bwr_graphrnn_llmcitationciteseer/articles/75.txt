Virtual reality (VR) systems have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing intuitive and immersive interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of embodiment and gesture-based interaction in VR, examining how users' sense of bodily presence and agency affects their experience. We present a study comparing three VR interaction modalities: controller-based, gesture-based, and hybrid. Our results show that gesture-based interaction enhances user engagement, reduces cognitive load, and increases feelings of presence, but also introduces challenges related to gesture recognition and feedback. We discuss implications for VR interface design and future research directions.
