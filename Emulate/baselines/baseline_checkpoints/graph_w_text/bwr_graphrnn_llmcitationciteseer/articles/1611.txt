Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, optimizing query execution plans for graph databases remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize graph database query execution. Our method, 'GraphRL', learns to select the most efficient query plan by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query performance. We evaluate GraphRL on several real-world graph datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
