Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic feature attribution methods, neglecting complex user-item relationships. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HiGAT) for ERS, which models user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph structure. HiGAT leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant user and item features, generating explanations in the form of feature importance scores. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
