This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems for real-time task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework that enables agents to learn cooperative strategies for task allocation and execution. Our method leverages a multi-agent deep Q-network (MA-DQN) that incorporates a graph neural network (GNN) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time, resource utilization, and robustness to agent failures. We validate our approach using a realistic simulation environment and a real-world case study.
