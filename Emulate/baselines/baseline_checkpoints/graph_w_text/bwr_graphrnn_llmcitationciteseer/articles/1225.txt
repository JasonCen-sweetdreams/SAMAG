Distributed database systems often require secure data sharing among multiple parties. Existing solutions rely on trusted third-party mediators or encrypted data transfer, which compromise on performance or scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'SecureShare', that leverages multi-party computation (MPC) to enable secure data sharing in distributed database systems. SecureShare uses a combination of homomorphic encryption and secure function evaluation to enable queries on shared data without revealing individual party's data. Our experiments on a real-world healthcare dataset demonstrate that SecureShare achieves a 3x performance improvement over existing solutions while maintaining strong security guarantees.
