Effective search intent disambiguation is crucial for e-commerce search engines to provide relevant results. Existing approaches rely on labor-intensive manual annotation or supervised learning, which can be time-consuming and costly. This paper proposes an unsupervised query intent disambiguation framework, 'IntentMine', that leverages graph-based clustering and semantic role labeling to identify underlying intent behind ambiguous queries. Our experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset show that IntentMine outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, while eliminating the need for manual annotation.
