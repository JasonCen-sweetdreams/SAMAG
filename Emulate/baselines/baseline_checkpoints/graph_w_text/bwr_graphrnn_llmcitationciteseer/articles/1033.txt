Complex query optimization is a critical challenge in multi-source data integration, where data is sourced from diverse, autonomous systems. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach for efficient query optimization, leveraging graph neural networks to model data dependencies and correlations. Our method, called GraphOpt, incorporates a two-stage optimization strategy that first identifies optimal data sources and then generates an execution plan. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques, reducing query execution time by up to 40% while maintaining result accuracy.
