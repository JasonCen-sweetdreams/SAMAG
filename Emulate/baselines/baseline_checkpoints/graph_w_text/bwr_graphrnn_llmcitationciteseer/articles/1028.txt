The proliferation of voice-based interfaces has led to a growing need to understand how personalization affects user engagement. This paper presents a mixed-methods study that explores the impact of personalization on user experience in voice-based interfaces. We designed and developed a voice-based assistant that incorporates user preferences and adapts to their behavior over time. Our results show that personalized responses lead to increased user satisfaction and engagement, but also raise concerns about bias and transparency. We provide design recommendations for voice-based interface designers and discuss the implications for future research in this area.
