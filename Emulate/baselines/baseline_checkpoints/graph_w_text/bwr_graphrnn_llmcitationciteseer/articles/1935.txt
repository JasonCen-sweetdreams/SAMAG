Traditional indexing techniques fail to scale with the exponential growth of big data, resulting in inefficient query execution times. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using learned index structures, which leverage machine learning models to predict the optimal index configuration for a given query workload. We develop a reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize index structures based on query patterns and data distributions, and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and storage efficiency on real-world datasets.
