Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document embedding approach, 'HDE', which captures both local and global semantic relationships within documents. Our method represents documents as a hierarchy of embeddings, where each node corresponds to a passage or section. This allows for more accurate and efficient retrieval of relevant passages, reducing the computational cost of downstream answer extraction. Experimental results on the SQuAD-Open dataset demonstrate significant improvements in passage retrieval accuracy and ODQA performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
