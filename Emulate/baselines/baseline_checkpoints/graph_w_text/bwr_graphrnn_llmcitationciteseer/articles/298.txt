The increasing volume and complexity of big data has led to a growing need for efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using column store indexing, which leverages the benefits of columnar storage to reduce query execution times. We propose a cost-based optimization framework that incorporates a probabilistic model to estimate query selectivity and a machine learning-based indexing strategy to adapt to changing data distributions. Experimental results on a large-scale analytics workload demonstrate a significant reduction in query execution times and improved resource utilization compared to traditional row store indexing.
