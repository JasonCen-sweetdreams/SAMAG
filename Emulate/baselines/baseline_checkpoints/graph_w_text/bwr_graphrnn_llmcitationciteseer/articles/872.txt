Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it helps to refine the search query and improve the retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion approach based on deep neural ranking models. Our method leverages the semantic relationships between words in the query and the document collection to generate effective expansion terms. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion methods. Our results show that the proposed method is particularly effective in retrieving relevant documents for ambiguous queries.
