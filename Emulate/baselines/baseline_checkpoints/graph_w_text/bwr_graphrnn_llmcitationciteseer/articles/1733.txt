Real-time traffic control in urban areas is a complex problem that requires efficient coordination of multiple agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for multi-agent systems, where each agent learns to optimize its own reward function while taking into account the actions of other agents. We introduce a novel graph-based representation of the traffic network, which enables efficient communication and coordination between agents. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network show that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized control methods in terms of reducing congestion and travel time.
