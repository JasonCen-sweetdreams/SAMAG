Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant context for answering questions. This paper presents a novel approach, DensePass, which leverages dense embeddings to index and search a large corpus of passages. We propose a hierarchical clustering method to construct a compact index, enabling fast and accurate passage retrieval. Experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that DensePass outperforms existing methods, achieving a 2.5x speedup while maintaining a 95% recall rate.
