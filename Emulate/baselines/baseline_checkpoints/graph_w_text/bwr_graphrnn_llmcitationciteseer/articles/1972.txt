In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our method, 'AgentTasker', learns to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, tasks' requirements, and environmental factors. We employ a decentralized DRL framework, where each agent learns to make decisions autonomously, while sharing knowledge with other agents through a communication network. Experimental results show that AgentTasker outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in complex, dynamic environments, and is scalable to large-scale systems.
