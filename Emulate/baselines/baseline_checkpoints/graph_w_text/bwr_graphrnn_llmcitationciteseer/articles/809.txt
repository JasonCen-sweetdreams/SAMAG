In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. Our approach represents the agent-task graph as a dynamic neural network, allowing agents to learn from their local observations and make autonomous decisions. We evaluate our framework in a simulated urban search and rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
