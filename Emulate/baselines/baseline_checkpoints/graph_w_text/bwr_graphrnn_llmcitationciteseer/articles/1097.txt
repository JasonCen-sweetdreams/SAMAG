Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval from a massive corpus to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Dense Passage Retrieval (HDPR), which leverages hierarchical dense representations to capture complex semantic relationships between questions and passages. Our method first encodes questions and passages into dense vectors using a neural retriever, and then applies a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group similar passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDPR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods in terms of both retrieval efficiency and downstream QA performance.
