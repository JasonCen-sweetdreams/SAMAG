Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval to reduce the search space for answer generation. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Neural Dense Passage Retrieval (HN-DPR) model that leverages a hierarchical architecture to prune irrelevant passages. Our approach combines a coarse-grained retrieval module with a fine-grained re-ranking module, achieving a 30% increase in retrieval accuracy and a 2x speedup compared to state-of-the-art DPR models. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HN-DPR in improving ODQA performance.
