Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-based learning, where the goal is to predict the labels of nodes in a graph. Recently, graph attention networks (GATs) have shown promising results in this domain. However, existing GAT models suffer from two major limitations: they are shallow and lack hierarchical representations. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hierarchical graph attention network (DHGAT) that addresses these limitations. Our model uses a hierarchical architecture to capture node representations at multiple scales, and employs a novel attention mechanism that adapts to the graph structure. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DHGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks.
