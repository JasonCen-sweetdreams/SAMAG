Color is a ubiquitous attribute in data visualization, but it can create barriers for individuals with color vision deficiency (CVD). This paper presents a human-centered design approach to create accessible visualizations for users with CVD. We conducted a series of user studies to identify effective color palette design principles and developed a novel algorithm to automatically generate CVD-friendly color schemes. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of data comprehension for users with CVD, while also enhancing overall user experience.
