Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query performance remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity of distributed indexing. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing approach that dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. We introduce a novel cost model that estimates the query execution time and optimizes the index configuration accordingly. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional static indexing techniques.
