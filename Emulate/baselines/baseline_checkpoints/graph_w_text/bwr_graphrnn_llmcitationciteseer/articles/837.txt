Distributed query processing is crucial for scalability in modern data systems, but optimizing join order enumeration remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'JoinEagle', which leverages graph neural networks to model the query plan space and efficiently explore promising join orders. We introduce a hierarchical representation of query plans, enabling our model to capture complex interactions between joins and effectively prune the search space. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that JoinEagle outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time, while also reducing the number of enumerations by an order of magnitude.
