Traditional query expansion techniques often rely on fixed rules or statistical methods, which may not capture the nuances of user intent. We propose a novel approach, 'NERD', that leverages reinforced neural ranking models to learn adaptive query expansion strategies. NERD integrates a deep reinforcement learning framework with a neural ranking model, allowing it to optimize query expansion for diverse search results. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NERD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of search result diversity and relevance, while reducing computational overhead.
