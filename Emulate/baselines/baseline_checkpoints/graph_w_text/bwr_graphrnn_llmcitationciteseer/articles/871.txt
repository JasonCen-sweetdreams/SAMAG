Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for open-domain question answering. However, its query retrieval performance is often hindered by the vocabulary mismatch problem. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach to address this issue. HQE leverages a hierarchical neural network to learn a multi-granular representation of the query, which is then used to expand the original query with relevant terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQE significantly improves the retrieval effectiveness of DPR models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of recall and MRR.
