Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it helps disambiguate user queries and retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep learning-based semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and document content. Our method, dubbed 'SemExpan', uses a multi-task learning framework to jointly learn term embeddings and query-document similarity metrics. Experimental results on benchmark IR datasets demonstrate that SemExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
