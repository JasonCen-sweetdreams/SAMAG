Traditional query expansion techniques often fail to adapt to the complexities of heterogeneous document collections, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes AQE-HT, a novel adaptive query expansion framework that leverages both local and global contextual information to identify relevant terms. AQE-HT incorporates a reinforcement learning module that dynamically adjusts the expansion strategy based on user feedback and document characteristics. Experimental results on a diverse collection of web documents demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art methods.
