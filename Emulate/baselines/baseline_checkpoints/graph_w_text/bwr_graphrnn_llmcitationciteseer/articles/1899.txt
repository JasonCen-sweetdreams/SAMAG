This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for autonomous agents, focusing on scenarios where agents have diverse capabilities and preferences. We propose a multi-objective optimization framework that balances task completion efficiency, agent workload, and resource utilization. Our algorithm leverages a decentralized, auction-based mechanism to assign tasks to agents, while incorporating constraints on agent capacity, spatial proximity, and temporal dependencies. Experimental results on a simulated drone-based surveillance system demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced resource waste compared to existing methods.
