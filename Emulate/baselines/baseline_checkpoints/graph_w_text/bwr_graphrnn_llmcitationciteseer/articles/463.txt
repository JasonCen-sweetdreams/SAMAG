Query expansion is a crucial component of document retrieval systems, as it helps to capture the nuances of user queries and improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'NeuroExp', which leverages neural embeddings to model the semantic relationships between query terms and document vocabulary. NeuroExp employs aEncoder-Decoder architecture to generate expanded queries that better capture the context and intent behind user queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExp outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
