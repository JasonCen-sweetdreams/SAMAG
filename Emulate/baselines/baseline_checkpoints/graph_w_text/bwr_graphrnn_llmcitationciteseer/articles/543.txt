Coordinating multi-agent systems in complex environments remains a challenging problem. We propose a novel approach that integrates reinforcement learning with graph attention mechanisms to enable effective collaboration among agents. Our framework, 'MA-GAT', learns to represent the agent interactions as a graph, which is then used to compute attention weights for each agent. These weights facilitate the selection of optimal actions that balance individual and collective goals. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate that MA-GAT outperforms existing methods in terms of overall system efficiency and adaptability to changing conditions.
