Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in modern online services, but their lack of transparency hinders trust and understanding. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that incorporates both item-level and user-level graph attention mechanisms. By learning hierarchical representations of user-item interactions, HGAT provides interpretable recommendations while achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in providing personalized explanations for recommended items, improving user satisfaction and trust in the system.
