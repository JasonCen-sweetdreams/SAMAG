In complex multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient allocation of tasks to agents with varying capabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep graph neural networks (DGNNs) to learn a task allocation policy that can scale to large numbers of agents and tasks. Our method, called GraphTask, leverages graph-based representations of agent capabilities and task requirements to learn a hierarchical allocation strategy. Experimental results on a simulated robotic warehouse environment show that GraphTask outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of allocation efficiency and adaptability to changing task requirements.
