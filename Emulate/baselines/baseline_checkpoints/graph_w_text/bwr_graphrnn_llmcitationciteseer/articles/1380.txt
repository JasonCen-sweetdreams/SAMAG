This paper addresses the problem of decentralized task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have diverse capabilities and tasks require varying levels of resources. We propose a novel approach based on graph attention networks (GATs) that learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a graph, and computes attention weights to capture their relationships. Our decentralized algorithm, 'GAT-Allocator', allows agents to communicate and negotiate task assignments in a distributed manner, while minimizing global objective functions such as makespan and energy consumption. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse logistics scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of GAT-Allocator in achieving near-optimal task allocations compared to centralized solvers.
