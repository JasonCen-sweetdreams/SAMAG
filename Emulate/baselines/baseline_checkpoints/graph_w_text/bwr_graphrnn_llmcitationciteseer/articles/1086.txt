Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in many households, but their effectiveness is often hindered by communication breakdowns, particularly for older adults. This paper investigates the role of conversational repair strategies in improving the usability and accessibility of voice assistants for this demographic. Through a mixed-methods approach, we identify common error scenarios and develop a taxonomy of repair strategies. Our findings inform the design of a novel voice assistant interface that incorporates proactive and reactive repair mechanisms, reducing errors and improving user satisfaction in a pilot study with older adults.
