With the increasing scale of distributed search engines, query expansion techniques play a crucial role in improving retrieval efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HiQE', which leverages both semantic and syntactic features to generate informative and diversified expansion terms. HiQE employs a two-stage framework, where the first stage uses word embeddings to identify semantically similar terms, and the second stage utilizes a syntax-based ranking model to prioritize expansion terms that are more likely to occur in relevant documents. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed search engine dataset demonstrate that HiQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and precision.
