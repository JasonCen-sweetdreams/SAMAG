Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to optimize query plans. We model the database schema as a graph and utilize GNNs to learn a representation of the query graph. Our approach, called GQN, outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by adapting to the complex dependencies between query operators and database schema. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GQN reduces query execution time by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art methods.
