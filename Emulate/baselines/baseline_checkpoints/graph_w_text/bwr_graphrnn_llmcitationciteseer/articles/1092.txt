Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a user's question. This paper presents a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach that efficiently retrieves top-k passages by jointly optimizing passage and document-level representations. Our method leverages a multi-level attention mechanism to capture both local and global context, resulting in improved retrieval accuracy and reduced computational cost. Experimental results on popular ODQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HDR, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of top-k accuracy and retrieval efficiency.
