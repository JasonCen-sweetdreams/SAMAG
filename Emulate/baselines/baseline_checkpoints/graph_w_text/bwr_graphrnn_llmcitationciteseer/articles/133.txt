This paper proposes a novel approach to cooperative task allocation for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We present a decentralized framework, 'CATALYST', that enables agents to learn cooperative policies for task allocation in complex, dynamic environments. Our approach leverages a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a multi-agent deep Q-network to learn optimal task allocation strategies. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of CATALYST in improving overall system performance and adaptability compared to traditional, hand-coded allocation methods.
