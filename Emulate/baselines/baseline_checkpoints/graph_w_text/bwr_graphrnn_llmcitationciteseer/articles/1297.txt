Multi-agent cooperation is a crucial aspect of many real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles and robotics. However, explaining the decision-making process of black-box models remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework, which leverages graph attention mechanisms and hierarchical reasoning to facilitate explainable cooperation among agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in various multi-agent scenarios, showcasing improved cooperation outcomes and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
