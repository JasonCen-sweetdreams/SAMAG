Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for older adults remains a concern. This study investigates the impact of speech recognition accuracy and cognitive load on the usability of conversational systems for older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+, comparing two speech recognition systems with varying accuracy levels. Results show that high-accuracy speech recognition significantly reduces cognitive load and improves user experience. We also identify key design recommendations for inclusive conversational interfaces, including adaptive feedback mechanisms and simplified dialogue flows.
