This paper proposes a novel distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for autonomous traffic signal control. Our method, referred to as 'Distributed Traffic Agent' (DTA), utilizes a decentralized architecture to enable real-time communication and coordination among agents controlling individual traffic signals. DTA incorporates a hybrid of deep Q-networks and graph neural networks to learn optimal traffic signal control policies, taking into account real-time traffic patterns, road network topology, and neighboring agents' actions. Experimental results on a simulated urban traffic network demonstrate significant reductions in congestion and travel times compared to traditional, centralized traffic signal control strategies.
