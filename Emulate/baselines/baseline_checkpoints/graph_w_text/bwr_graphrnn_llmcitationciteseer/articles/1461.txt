The cold start problem in recommendation systems hinders personalized suggestions for new users or items. This paper proposes a novel hybrid retrieval model, 'HyRec', that combines the strengths of collaborative filtering (CF) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. HyRec leverages item embeddings from a pre-trained language model to augment user-item interactions, thus enabling effective retrieval for cold start items. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that HyRec outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of precision, recall, and A/B testing metrics.
