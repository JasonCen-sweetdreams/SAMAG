While neural ranking models have significantly improved the accuracy of document retrieval systems, their computational complexity remains a major bottleneck. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HiRank', which leverages a novel tree-based architecture to reduce the number of document comparisons required during retrieval. Our experiments on several large-scale datasets demonstrate that HiRank achieves comparable retrieval performance to state-of-the-art models while reducing inference time by up to 60%. Furthermore, we show that HiRank can be easily integrated into existing retrieval systems, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.
