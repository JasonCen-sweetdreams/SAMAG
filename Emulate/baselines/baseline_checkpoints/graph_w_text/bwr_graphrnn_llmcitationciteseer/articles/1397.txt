Real-time resource allocation in distributed systems is a challenging problem, particularly in scenarios where multiple agents with competing goals need to coordinate their actions. This paper presents a novel decentralized coordination framework that leverages machine learning and game theory to optimize resource allocation in real-time. Our approach, called 'MACRO', uses a hierarchical structure of agents that can adapt to changing system dynamics and negotiate resource allocation through a distributed auction mechanism. Experimental results on a simulated cloud computing platform demonstrate that MACRO achieves significant improvements in resource utilization and response time compared to existing approaches.
