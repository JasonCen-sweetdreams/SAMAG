This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent task allocation, a challenging problem in distributed artificial intelligence. We introduce HGN-Allocator, a hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) framework that efficiently allocates tasks to agents in large-scale systems. Our method leverages the hierarchical structure of the agent communication graph to learn task-dependent representations and perform task allocation in a scalable manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGN-Allocator on several real-world task allocation benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in allocation efficiency and solution quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.
