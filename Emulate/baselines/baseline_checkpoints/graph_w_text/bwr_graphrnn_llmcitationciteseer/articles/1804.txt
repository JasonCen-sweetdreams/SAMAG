Few-shot image classification tasks require models to adapt quickly to new classes with limited data. This paper proposes a novel deep meta-learning approach, 'AdaTask', which learns to generate task embeddings that adapt to the specific classification task at hand. Our method leverages a hierarchical neural network to learn a task-agnostic representation and then fine-tunes the embeddings for each new task. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet, and show that AdaTask outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency.
