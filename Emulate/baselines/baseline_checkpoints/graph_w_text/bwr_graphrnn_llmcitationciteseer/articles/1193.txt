In this paper, we address the distributed task allocation problem in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have varying capabilities and task requirements. We propose an evolutionary game-theoretic approach, where agents adapt their strategies based on payoffs from previous interactions. Our algorithm, called EvoTask, incorporates a novel mutation operator that exploits the structure of the task graph to improve allocation efficiency. Simulation results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that EvoTask outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time, communication overhead, and robustness to agent failures.
