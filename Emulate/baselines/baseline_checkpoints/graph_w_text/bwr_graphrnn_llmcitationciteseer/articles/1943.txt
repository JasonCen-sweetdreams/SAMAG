Distributed database systems often struggle with query performance due to the complexity of data distribution and indexing. This paper presents a novel adaptive indexing approach, 'DynaIndex', which dynamically adjusts the index structure based on query patterns and data distribution. DynaIndex leverages machine learning-based query prediction and adaptive sampling to optimize index creation and maintenance. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database show that DynaIndex achieves an average of 30% improvement in query response time compared to traditional indexing methods.
