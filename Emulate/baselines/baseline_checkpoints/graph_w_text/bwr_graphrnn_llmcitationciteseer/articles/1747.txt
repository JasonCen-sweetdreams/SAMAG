In multi-agent systems, ensuring trust and cooperation among autonomous agents is crucial. Traditional approaches rely on centralized authorities, which can be vulnerable to single points of failure and manipulation. This paper proposes a decentralized reputation system based on blockchain technology, enabling agents to evaluate and update each other's trustworthiness in a transparent and tamper-proof manner. We develop a novel consensus algorithm, 'RepChain', which integrates reputation updates with blockchain transactions, and demonstrate its efficacy in simulations of autonomous vehicles and smart grids.
