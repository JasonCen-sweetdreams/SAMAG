The proliferation of online documents has rendered traditional search engines inefficient, necessitating novel document retrieval techniques. This paper presents a neural re-ranking model, 'DocRanker', that leverages BERT-based encoding and graph attention mechanisms to capture semantic relationships between query and document representations. By pruning irrelevant documents using a hierarchical clustering approach, DocRanker reduces the computational overhead of traditional ranking models while maintaining superior retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on a large-scale web dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a 25% reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art re-ranking models.
