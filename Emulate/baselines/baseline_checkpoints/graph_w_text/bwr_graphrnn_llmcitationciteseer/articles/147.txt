Virtual reality (VR) learning environments have shown promise in enhancing user engagement and learning outcomes. This study explores the impact of personalization on user experience in VR learning environments. We designed and implemented a personalized VR system that adaptively adjusts the learning content, pace, and feedback based on individual users' learning styles, preferences, and performance. Our user study with 120 participants reveals that personalized VR experiences lead to significant increases in user engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention compared to non-personalized VR and traditional learning environments. We also identify key factors that influence the effectiveness of personalization in VR learning.
