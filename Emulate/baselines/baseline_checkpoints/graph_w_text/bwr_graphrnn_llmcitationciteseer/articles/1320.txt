Short-text search is a challenging problem in information retrieval, where the brevity of queries often leads to poor retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our model, dubbed 'DeepQE', uses a combination of word embeddings and convolutional neural networks to generate expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short queries, when compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
