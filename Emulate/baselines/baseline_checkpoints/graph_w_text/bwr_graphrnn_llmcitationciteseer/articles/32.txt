Neural search engines have shown promising results in various information retrieval tasks. However, they often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion framework, 'CAQE', which leverages both semantic and syntactic features to disambiguate user queries. We develop a graph-based attention mechanism that captures the relationships between query terms, entities, and context words, allowing the model to selectively expand the query with relevant terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE significantly improves the retrieval performance of neural search engines, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
