Short-text collections, such as Twitter or product reviews, pose unique challenges for information retrieval systems. Query expansion techniques can improve retrieval effectiveness, but existing methods often rely on term co-occurrence statistics or manually curated resources. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'EmbedQE', uses a graph-based algorithm to select expansion terms that are most similar to the original query in the vector space. Experiments on several short-text datasets demonstrate that EmbedQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, particularly for queries with low term frequency.
