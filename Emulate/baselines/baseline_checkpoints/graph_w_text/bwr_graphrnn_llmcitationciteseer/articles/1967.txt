This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, where agents possess heterogeneous capabilities and resources. We propose a decentralized, auction-based approach that utilizes a novel, capability-aware bidding strategy to allocate tasks efficiently. Our approach takes into account not only the agents' processing capacities but also their communication constraints and task precedence relationships. Experimental results on a series of benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements in task completion times and resource utilization compared to existing centralized and decentralized approaches.
