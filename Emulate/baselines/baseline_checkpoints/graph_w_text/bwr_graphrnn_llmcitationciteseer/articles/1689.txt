This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for autonomous agents using distributed constraint optimization. We propose a hybrid framework that combines constraint programming with multi-agent negotiation to efficiently allocate tasks to agents in a decentralized manner. Our approach leverages the concept of constraint relaxation to handle conflicting constraints and enables agents to adapt to dynamic changes in the environment. Experimental results on a simulated robotics platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing task allocation latency and improving overall system performance.
