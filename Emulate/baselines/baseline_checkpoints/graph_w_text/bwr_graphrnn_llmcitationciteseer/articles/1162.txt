Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and learning outcomes in VR-based learning environments. We designed a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigned to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of presence, motivation, and overall satisfaction, leading to improved learning outcomes. We also identified key design factors influencing avatar personalization and provide guidelines for educational VR system designers.
