As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible technology that accommodates older adults with motor impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating gestural interfaces that cater to this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving participatory design workshops and usability testing to inform the development of a gesture recognition system tailored to older adults with motor impairments. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive gesture recognition, personalized feedback, and multimodal interaction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a proof-of-concept system that achieved a 30% reduction in gesture recognition errors compared to existing systems.
