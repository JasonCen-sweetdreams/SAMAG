Distributed information retrieval (IR) systems face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from a massive, geographically dispersed corpus. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and document contents. HQE adaptively expands the query using a hierarchical clustering of term co-occurrences, reducing the search space and improving retrieval precision. Our experiments on a large-scale, distributed IR testbed demonstrate significant performance gains over traditional query expansion methods, with average precision improvements of up to 23% at top-10 recall.
