Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but current avatar designs often fail to elicit emotional responses from users. This paper presents an investigation into the role of emotive avatars in enhancing user engagement in VR environments. We propose a novel framework for designing avatars that incorporate subtle emotional cues, and evaluate its effectiveness through a user study. Results show that users exhibit increased emotional arousal and engagement when interacting with emotive avatars, compared to traditional, neutral avatars. Our findings have implications for the design of future VR systems that aim to facilitate deeper user connections and more immersive experiences.
