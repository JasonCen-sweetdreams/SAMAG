Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the lives of individuals with motor impairments, but existing VR interfaces often rely on precise hand or finger movements that can be challenging for this population. This study investigates the efficacy of gestural feedback in VR interfaces designed for users with motor impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, comparing traditional visual and auditory feedback to a novel gestural feedback system that utilizes haptic and proprioceptive cues. Results show significant improvements in task completion time, accuracy, and user satisfaction with the gestural feedback system, highlighting its potential for increasing accessibility in VR applications.
