In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous task allocation using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We propose a hierarchical framework that integrates a high-level task allocator with low-level agent controllers, enabling agents to learn optimal task assignments and execution strategies. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
