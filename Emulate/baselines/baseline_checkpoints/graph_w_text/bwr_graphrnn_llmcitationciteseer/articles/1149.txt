Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing techniques often rely on simplistic term weighting and language modeling. This paper proposes a neural approach, 'NDE-QE', which leverages document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms and documents. We employ a transformer-based architecture to generate contextualized embeddings, which are then used to expand the query with relevant terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that NDE-QE achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of MAP and NDCG@20.
