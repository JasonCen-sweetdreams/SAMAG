Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in many real-world applications, but traditional methods often struggle with long-term dependencies and high-dimensional data. This paper introduces HATS (Hierarchical Attention-based Time-Series forecasting), a novel deep learning framework that leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant time-steps and feature dimensions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HATS on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational complexity by up to 40% compared to existing methods.
