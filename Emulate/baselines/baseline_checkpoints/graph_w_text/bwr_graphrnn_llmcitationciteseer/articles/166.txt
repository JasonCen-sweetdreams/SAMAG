Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering or simple term weighting schemes, which may not effectively capture the nuances of natural language. We propose a novel approach, 'RL-QE', that leverages reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query expansion strategy. Our method uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that selects the most informative terms to add to the original query, based on the reward signal of improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and NDCG.
