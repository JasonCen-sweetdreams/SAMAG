Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture the semantic intent behind user queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using neural semantic graphs, which model the relationships between query terms and relevant concepts in a knowledge graph. Our method, dubbed 'NeuQE', leverages graph attention mechanisms to identify the most informative expansion terms and integrates them into a re-weighted query representation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
