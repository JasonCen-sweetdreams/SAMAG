This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible gestural interfaces tailored to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops and usability studies to identify key design principles and guidelines for reducing cognitive load and improving gestural recognition accuracy. Our proposed interface, 'EasyGesture', incorporates simplification strategies, visual cues, and personalized feedback to facilitate intuitive gesture interaction. A pilot study with 20 older adults with mild cognitive impairments demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing gestural interfaces.
