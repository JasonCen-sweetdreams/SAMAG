Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, as it affects the accuracy of subsequent applications. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GATE', which leverages graph attention networks to disambiguate entities in knowledge graphs. GATE utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global context, allowing it to effectively differentiate between entities with similar names. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GATE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 12.5% in disambiguation accuracy.
