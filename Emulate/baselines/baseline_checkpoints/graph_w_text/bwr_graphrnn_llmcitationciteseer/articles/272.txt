The proliferation of IoT devices and social media platforms has led to an exponential growth in data volumes, necessitating efficient data warehousing solutions. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'FlashIndex', optimized for modern storage devices such as flash drives and solid-state drives. FlashIndex leverages the characteristics of these devices to reduce query latency and improve overall system performance. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that FlashIndex outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 30% in terms of query response time and up to 25% in terms of storage efficiency.
