Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems have become increasingly popular for large-scale data retrieval. However, optimizing query processing in DIR systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DirOpt', which leverages a hierarchical indexing structure and adaptive query routing to minimize communication overhead and improve query response times. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DirOpt on a real-world dataset, achieving an average query latency reduction of 35% compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
