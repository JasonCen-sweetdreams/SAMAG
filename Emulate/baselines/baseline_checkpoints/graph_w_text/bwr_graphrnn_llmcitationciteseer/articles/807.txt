Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Traditional cost-based optimization techniques often fail to capture complex data distributions and workload patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict the optimal join order and indexing strategy based on query characteristics and database statistics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
