Distributed databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management systems. However, optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge, particularly in the presence of complex queries and dynamic workloads. This paper introduces 'AI-Index', a novel framework that leverages machine learning to select optimal indexes for distributed databases. By analyzing query patterns and workload characteristics, AI-Index identifies the most effective index configurations, resulting in significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization. Experimental evaluations on a real-world distributed database demonstrate the efficacy of AI-Index in reducing query latency by up to 40% compared to traditional indexing methods.
