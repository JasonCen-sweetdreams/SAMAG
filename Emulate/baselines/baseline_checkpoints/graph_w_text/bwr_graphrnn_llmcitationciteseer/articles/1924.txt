Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document embedding (HDE) framework, which captures both local and global semantic relationships within documents. Our approach leverages a combination of sentence embeddings and graph-based document representations to encode documents at multiple granularities. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDE-based passage retrieval significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of recall and computational efficiency, enabling faster and more accurate ODQA systems.
