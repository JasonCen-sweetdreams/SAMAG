Distributed database systems face significant challenges in terms of data retrieval efficiency, particularly in scenarios involving large-scale datasets and high query volumes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'Distributed Hierarchical Indexing' (DHI), which leverages a combination of local and global indexing mechanisms to improve query performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DHI through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, showcasing improvements in query response time and system scalability compared to traditional indexing techniques.
