Recommender systems are crucial for personalized services, but traditional methods struggle with large-scale datasets. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships. HGAT learns to represent users and items as hierarchical graph structures, enabling efficient and scalable recommendation generation. Our experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
