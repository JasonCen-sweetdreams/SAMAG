Coordinating multiple agents to achieve a common goal is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn efficient coordination strategies. Our method, called HRL-GNN, uses GNNs to model the graph structure of the agents' interactions and HRL to learn high-level policies that coordinate the agents' actions. We evaluate HRL-GNN in a variety of multi-agent scenarios, including traffic management and resource allocation, and demonstrate significant improvements in coordination efficiency and overall system performance.
