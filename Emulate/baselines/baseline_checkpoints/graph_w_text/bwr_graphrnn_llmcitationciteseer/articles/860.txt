Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide transparency into the decision-making process. This paper introduces a novel attention-based graph neural network (AGNN) model that incorporates both user-item interactions and item attributes to generate personalized explanations for recommendations. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to identify influential items and highlight relevant features, enabling users to understand the reasoning behind the recommended items. Empirical results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AGNN in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
