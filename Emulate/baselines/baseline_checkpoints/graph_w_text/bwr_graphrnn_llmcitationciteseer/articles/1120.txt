Zero-shot learning (ZSL) has seen significant progress with the advent of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, most existing approaches rely on manual graph construction or require large amounts of labeled data. This paper proposes a novel graph-based meta-reinforcement learning framework, 'MetaZSL', which learns to adapt to new unseen classes without additional training data. We introduce a reinforcement learning objective that encourages the agent to explore the graph structure and meta-learn effective policies for ZSL tasks. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaZSL in improving ZSL performance and reducing the need for manual graph engineering.
