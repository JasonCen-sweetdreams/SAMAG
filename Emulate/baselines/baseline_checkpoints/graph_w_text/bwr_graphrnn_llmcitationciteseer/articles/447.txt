Online learning on imbalanced time-series data is a challenging problem, as it requires adapting to concept drifts and handling class imbalance. This paper proposes a novel online learning algorithm, 'ARISTA', which employs adaptive regularization to dynamically adjust the learning rate and regularization strength. We introduce a novel imbalance measure based on the Hellinger distance, which guides the adaptation of regularization. Experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate that ARISTA outperforms state-of-the-art online learning methods in terms of accuracy and F1-score, especially in scenarios with severe class imbalance.
