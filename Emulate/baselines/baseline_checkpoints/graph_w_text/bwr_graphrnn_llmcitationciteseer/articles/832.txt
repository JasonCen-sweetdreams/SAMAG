Traditional ranking models in search engines rely on hand-crafted features, which often fail to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a hybrid neural ranking model, 'NeuRank', that combines the strengths of neural networks and traditional ranking models. NeuRank employs a multi-task learning framework, where a shared neural encoder learns to represent queries and documents in a joint latent space, while task-specific ranking and classification heads optimize for relevance and semantic matching. Experiments on a large-scale web search dataset demonstrate that NeuRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of retrieval efficiency and document ranking quality.
