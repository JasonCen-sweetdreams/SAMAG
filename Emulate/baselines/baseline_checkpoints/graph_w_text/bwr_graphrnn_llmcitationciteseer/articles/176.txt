Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to enrich the original query to better capture user intent. Traditional methods rely on term frequency and co-occurrence analysis, but often struggle to capture semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuroXpand', which learns dense vector representations of query terms and their contextual relationships. By incorporating these embeddings into a novel query expansion framework, we demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance on several benchmark datasets, including TREC and ClueWeb. Our approach also exhibits robustness to query ambiguity and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision.
