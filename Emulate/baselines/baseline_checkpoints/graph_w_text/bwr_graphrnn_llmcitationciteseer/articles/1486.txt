Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel approach based on deep variational autoencoders (DVAEs), which learn a probabilistic representation of normal data patterns. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that incorporates temporal and spatial attention mechanisms, enabling the model to capture complex dependencies and Identify anomalies at multiple scales. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to noise and concept drift.
