Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph patterns and the need to minimize communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel query optimization technique that leverages subgraph homomorphism to efficiently identify and prune unnecessary subqueries. We introduce a hierarchical query decomposition framework that exploits the structural properties of graph patterns, reducing the search space and improving query performance. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x.
