The proliferation of large-scale RDF graph databases has led to significant query optimization challenges. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RDFox', which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, caching, and parallel execution to improve query performance in distributed RDF settings. We introduce a cost-based optimization model that takes into account the underlying graph structure, query patterns, and available system resources. Experimental evaluations on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that RDFox outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query throughput and response time.
