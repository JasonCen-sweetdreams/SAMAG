Intelligent traffic signal control is crucial for efficient urban transportation. This paper presents a novel hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'HMA-ATSC', for autonomous traffic signal control. HMA-ATSC consists of a central coordinator agent and multiple local agents, each responsible for a traffic intersection. The coordinator agent learns to optimize traffic signal timings at the network level, while local agents adapt to real-time traffic conditions. We evaluate HMA-ATSC on a realistic urban traffic simulator and demonstrate significant reductions in travel time, congestion, and emissions compared to traditional fixed-time signal control and state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.
