Distributed database systems (DDS) with heterogeneous storage face significant challenges in optimizing query performance. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'HetOpt', which leverages machine learning and statistical modeling to adapt to diverse storage configurations. HetOpt integrates a cost-based optimizer with a reinforcement learning module that learns to predict query execution times and adjusts the optimization strategy accordingly. Our experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that HetOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3.5x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
