The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential increase in streaming data, posing significant challenges for real-time data integration and querying. This paper presents 'AQOS', an adaptive query optimization system that dynamically adjusts query plans based on IoT stream characteristics and workload patterns. AQOS leverages machine learning models to predict query performance and optimize query execution, resulting in improved response times and reduced resource utilization. Experimental evaluations on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate AQOS's ability to achieve up to 3x faster query response times and 40% reduced CPU utilization compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
