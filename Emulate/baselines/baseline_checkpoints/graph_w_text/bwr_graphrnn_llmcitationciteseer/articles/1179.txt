Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities must coordinate to accomplish tasks efficiently. This paper presents a novel approach that combines auctions and reinforcement learning to allocate tasks in a decentralized manner. Our method, called Auction-RL, uses a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auction mechanism to allocate tasks to agents based on their bids, and employs reinforcement learning to adapt the bidding strategy to the dynamic environment. We evaluate Auction-RL in a simulated robotics scenario and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving task completion rates and reducing coordination overhead compared to existing decentralized task allocation methods.
