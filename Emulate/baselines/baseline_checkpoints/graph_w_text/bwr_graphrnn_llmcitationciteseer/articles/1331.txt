As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to ensure that older adults with cognitive impairments can fully participate in VR experiences. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults with cognitive impairments and caregivers, resulting in the development of a novel VR interface that incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified navigation and error forgiveness. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to a standard VR interface.
