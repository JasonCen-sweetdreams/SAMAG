Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR), particularly when dealing with ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query term weighting by integrating deep neural relevance models into the traditional retrieval framework. We introduce a neural query term scorer that leverages contextualized embeddings and attention mechanisms to capture nuanced term dependencies. Experiments on several TREC datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including those based on BM25 and query expansion. Our analysis reveals that the neural scorer effectively identifies and weights informative query terms, leading to improved retrieval performance.
