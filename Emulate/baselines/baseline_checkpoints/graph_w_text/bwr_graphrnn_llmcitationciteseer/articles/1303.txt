Few-shot learning aims to learn from limited data, but existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity and poor generalization. This paper proposes Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical feature representations and attention mechanisms to improve few-shot learning efficiency. HANs adaptively select relevant feature subsets and aggregate them using a hierarchical attention mechanism, reducing the requirement for large-scale labeled data. We evaluate HANs on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods.
