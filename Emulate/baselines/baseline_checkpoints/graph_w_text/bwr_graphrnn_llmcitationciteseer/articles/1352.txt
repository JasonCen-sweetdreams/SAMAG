In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model complex agent interactions and optimize task assignments. We propose a coordinated task allocation framework, 'CAT-GNN', which integrates GNNs with a decentralized optimization algorithm to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Our experiments on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that CAT-GNN outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time, resource utilization, and overall system performance.
