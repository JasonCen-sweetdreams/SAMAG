In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that involves assigning tasks to agents in a decentralized manner. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph attention networks (GATs) to learn the task allocation policy. Our method, called GAT-ALLOC, leverages the graph structure of the agent communication network to learn attention weights that capture the importance of each agent's local information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GAT-ALLOC in a simulated disaster response scenario, where it outperforms traditional decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and communication overhead.
