This paper addresses the challenging problem of distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal task assignment policies. Our method, called 'DeepAlloc', utilizes a decentralized actor-critic framework, where each agent learns to select tasks based on its local observations and received rewards. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepAlloc through extensive simulations, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing algorithms.
