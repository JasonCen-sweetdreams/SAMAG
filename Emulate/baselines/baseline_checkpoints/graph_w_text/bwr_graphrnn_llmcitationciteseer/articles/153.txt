Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach for efficient query optimization in multi-tenant environments. Our method, called GraphOpt, leverages the structural properties of query graphs to identify optimal index configurations. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional indexing techniques, with up to 3x reduction in query latency and 2x reduction in storage overhead.
