Data warehouses are increasingly used to support real-time analytics, but maintaining materialized views in the presence of frequent data updates remains a significant challenge. We propose a novel incremental view maintenance algorithm, 'DynaView', which leverages a combination of data sampling and machine learning-based change detection to minimize the overhead of view maintenance. Our approach is designed to adapt to dynamic data distributions and varying update frequencies, ensuring efficient and accurate view refreshment. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DynaView outperforms existing methods in terms of maintenance cost and view freshness.
