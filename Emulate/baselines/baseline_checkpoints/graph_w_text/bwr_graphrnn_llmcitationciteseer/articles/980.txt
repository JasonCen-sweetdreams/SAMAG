Ad-hoc retrieval often relies on query expansion to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep learning-based semantic embeddings to enhance query expansion. We introduce a neural network architecture that learns to represent queries and documents in a shared semantic space, enabling more effective query expansion through semantic similarity matching. Experimental results on several TREC benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion methods, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
