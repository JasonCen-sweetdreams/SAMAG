With the increasing adoption of graph databases in various domains, there is a growing need for efficient query optimization techniques to support real-time analytics. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization and query rewriting to minimize query latency. We propose a cost-based optimization approach that considers both the structural properties of the graph and the workload characteristics. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale social network dataset demonstrates that GraphOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
