In large-scale multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation and execution are critical for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized framework for task allocation and execution using blockchain-based reputation systems. Our approach leverages smart contracts to incentivize agents to behave reputably, and a probabilistic model to predict agent performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated disaster response scenario, where agents must coordinate to rescue stranded individuals. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion rate, response time, and robustness to malicious agents.
