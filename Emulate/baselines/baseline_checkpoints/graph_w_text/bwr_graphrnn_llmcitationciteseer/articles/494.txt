Distributed search engines have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data queries. However, query efficiency remains a significant challenge, particularly in scenarios where data is scattered across multiple machines. This paper presents a novel approach to indexing and querying in distributed search engines. We propose a hierarchical indexing scheme that exploits the inherent structure of the data to reduce the number of machines involved in query processing. Our experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate significant improvements in query latency and throughput compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
