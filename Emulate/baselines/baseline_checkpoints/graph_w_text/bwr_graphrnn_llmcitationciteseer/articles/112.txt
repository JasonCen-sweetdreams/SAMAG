Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but traditional input methods can be cumbersome and limiting. This paper explores the potential of gaze-based interaction in VR, focusing on the relationship between eye movement patterns and user experience. We conducted a user study involving 30 participants, analyzing their eye movements and subjective feedback while interacting with a VR environment. Our results show that gaze-based interaction can significantly reduce user fatigue and improve overall experience, especially for tasks requiring precision and accuracy. We also identify key eye movement patterns that can inform the design of more intuitive and user-friendly VR interfaces.
