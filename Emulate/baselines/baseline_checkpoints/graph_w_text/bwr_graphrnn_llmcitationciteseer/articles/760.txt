Query optimization for distributed semi-structured data remains a challenging problem. Existing approaches rely on heuristics or manual tuning, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a novel framework, 'RL-QOpt', that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed semi-structured data. RL-QOpt uses a deep Q-network to learn from query execution experiences and adapt to changing data distributions. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
