Unsupervised representation learning has become increasingly important in computer vision, as it allows models to learn features without human annotations. This paper proposes a novel deep hierarchical clustering framework, 'HierClus', which learns hierarchical representations by iteratively clustering and refining feature embeddings. We introduce a novel loss function that encourages the discovery of discriminative and hierarchical features, and demonstrate the effectiveness of HierClus on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Experimental results show that HierClus outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods in terms of clustering quality and downstream task performance.
