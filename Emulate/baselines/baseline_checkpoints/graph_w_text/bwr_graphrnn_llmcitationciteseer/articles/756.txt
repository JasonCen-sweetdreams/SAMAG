Deep generative models have shown remarkable success in various applications, but their clustering capabilities are often limited by the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm, 'DeepHier', which leverages the representational power of deep neural networks to learn a hierarchical structure of clusters. We introduce a scalable, online learning framework that adaptively updates the clustering tree as new data points arrive, enabling efficient processing of large datasets. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepHier achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance while reducing computational complexity.
