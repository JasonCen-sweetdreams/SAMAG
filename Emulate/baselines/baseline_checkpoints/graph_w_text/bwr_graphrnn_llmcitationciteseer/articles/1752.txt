Scientific document retrieval often relies on query expansion to improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, dubbed 'PhraseEmb', which leverages phrase embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and document phrases. We demonstrate that PhraseEmb outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, such as Rocchio and Latent Semantic Analysis, on a benchmark dataset of scientific articles. Furthermore, we show that PhraseEmb is particularly effective when combined with a neural ranking model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the TREC-COVID dataset.
