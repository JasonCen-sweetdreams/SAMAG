In complex multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. We propose a decentralized DRL framework, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. Our approach leverages graph attention networks to model inter-agent dependencies and incorporates a distributed exploration strategy to improve adaptability in dynamic environments. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and agent coordination compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
