This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural indexing approach for efficient document retrieval. Our method, called HNI, leverages a two-level indexing structure to reduce the dimensionality of the document representation space. The first level uses a coarse-grained neural network to cluster similar documents, while the second level employs a fine-grained network to perform similarity search within each cluster. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNI achieves significant improvements in query efficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods.
