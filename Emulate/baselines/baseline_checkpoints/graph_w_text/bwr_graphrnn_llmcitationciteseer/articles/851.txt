Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to rank documents relevant to a given query. This paper proposes a novel approach, HierRank, which leverages hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to model the relationships between documents and queries. By incorporating both local and global graph structures, HierRank captures nuanced semantic patterns and improves ranking performance. Experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HierRank, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision.
