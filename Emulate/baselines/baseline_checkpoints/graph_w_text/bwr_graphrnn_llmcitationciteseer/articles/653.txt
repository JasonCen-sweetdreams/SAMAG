Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process of AI models. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for ERS, which learns to selectively focus on relevant user and item features. Our approach leverages multi-hop attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between users, items, and their corresponding attributes. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explainability.
