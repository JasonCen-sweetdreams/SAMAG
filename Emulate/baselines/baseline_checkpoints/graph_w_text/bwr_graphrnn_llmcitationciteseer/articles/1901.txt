Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it enhances the retrieval performance by incorporating relevant terms into the original query. However, existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not effectively capture the semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages neural networks to learn a dense representation of query terms and expands the query using a learned similarity metric. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
