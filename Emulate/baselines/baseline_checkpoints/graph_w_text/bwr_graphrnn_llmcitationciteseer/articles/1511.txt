Individuals with dyslexia often face challenges when interacting with digital interfaces. This paper presents an adaptive assistive interface framework, 'DyslexiaAid', which leverages machine learning-based text analysis and user modeling to provide personalized support for users with dyslexia. Our approach incorporates real-time text simplification, font and color adjustments, and dynamic hinting to enhance readability and comprehension. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates significant improvements in reading speed and accuracy, as well as increased user satisfaction, when using DyslexiaAid compared to standard interfaces.
