Open-domain question answering (ODQA) models rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. Existing methods often employ bag-of-words or dense retrieval techniques, which may not effectively capture lexical semantic relationships. This paper proposes Lexical Semantic Indexing (LSI), a novel passage indexing approach that incorporates contextualized word embeddings and graph-based clustering. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that LSI improves passage retrieval accuracy by 12.5% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while reducing the indexing time by 30%. We also show that LSI enables more efficient question answering by reducing the number of passages required for answer extraction.
