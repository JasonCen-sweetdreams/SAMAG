Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in reducing stress and anxiety, but existing VR systems often lack emotional support. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EmoAvatar', an emotional avatar that provides empathetic responses to users' affective states in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that EmoAvatar significantly reduces users' stress levels and improves their overall VR experience. Our findings highlight the importance of emotional support in VR and provide guidelines for designing emotionally intelligent avatars that can mitigate stress and anxiety.
