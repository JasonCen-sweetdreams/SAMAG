Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in knowledge graph construction, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a given mention. Existing approaches suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large-scale knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a novel graph-based deep learning approach, GraphED, which leverages the structural properties of knowledge graphs to disambiguate entities. GraphED uses a graph attention mechanism to capture contextual information and a hierarchical clustering strategy to reduce the search space. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that GraphED outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, achieving an F1-score of 95.2% on the YAGO dataset.
