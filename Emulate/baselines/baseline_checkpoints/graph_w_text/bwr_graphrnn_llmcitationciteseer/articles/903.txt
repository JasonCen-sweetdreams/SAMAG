Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the underlying intent behind a user's query, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised query intent discovery approach, 'IntentMine', which leverages a combination of semantic role labeling and clustering to identify latent intent categories from a large query log. We evaluate IntentMine on a dataset of 100,000 queries and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we provide insights into the discovered intent categories and their implications for retrieval system design.
