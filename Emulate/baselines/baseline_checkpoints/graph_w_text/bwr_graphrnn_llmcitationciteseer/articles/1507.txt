Real-time analytics in distributed database systems is crucial for various applications, including financial forecasting and IoT monitoring. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the dynamic nature of data and workloads. This paper presents 'DynaOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and statistical models to adapt to changing data patterns and system conditions. DynaOpt incorporates a feedback loop that continuously monitors query performance and adjusts optimization strategies to minimize latency and improve throughput. Experimental results on a distributed database benchmark demonstrate that DynaOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of average query response time.
