As robots increasingly interact with humans in various settings, efficient human-robot collaboration (HRC) is crucial. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical multi-task learning (HMTL) framework that enables robots to learn multiple HRC tasks simultaneously, while adapting to changing human behavior. By leveraging a hierarchical structure, our approach reduces the complexity of the learning problem, allowing for faster adaptation and improved task performance. Experimental results on a real-world HRC dataset demonstrate that our HMTL framework outperforms existing single-task learning methods in terms of task success rate and human satisfaction.
