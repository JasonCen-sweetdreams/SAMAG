We propose a novel framework for coordinating heterogeneous task-oriented agents using hierarchical reinforcement learning. Our approach, called Hierarchical Task Assignment and Coordination (HTAC), employs a two-level hierarchy of agents: high-level task managers and low-level skill executors. Task managers learn to assign tasks to skill executors based on their capabilities and the current environment, while skill executors learn to execute tasks using reinforcement learning. We evaluate HTAC in a simulated robotics domain and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced coordination overhead compared to flat, non-hierarchical approaches.
