Distributed column-stores have become increasingly popular for large-scale data analytics. However, query optimization remains a challenging problem due to the complex interactions between storage layouts, query patterns, and resource constraints. This paper proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework, 'DynaOpt', to optimize query execution plans for distributed column-stores. DynaOpt integrates a query simulator, a DRL agent, and a knowledge graph to learn optimal query plans that minimize execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DynaOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x speedup and 2x resource reduction.
