Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but people with dyslexia often struggle to interact with them effectively. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create more inclusive conversational interfaces for individuals with dyslexia. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving surveys, interviews, and usability testing to identify the challenges and needs of this population. Our findings informed the development of a set of design guidelines and a prototype system that incorporates multimodal input, visual aids, and personalized support. Evaluation results show significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates for participants with dyslexia, demonstrating the potential of our approach to promote digital inclusion.
