Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed database systems, where the goal is to minimize query execution time and resource utilization. Traditional query optimizers rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which may not adapt well to changing workloads and system dynamics. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query plan selection policy. Our approach uses a deep Q-network to estimate the expected execution time of different query plans and selects the optimal plan based on the current system state. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach achieves an average query execution time reduction of 30% compared to traditional query optimizers.
