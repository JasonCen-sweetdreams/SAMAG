Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their accessibility features often fall short for visually impaired users. This paper presents an empirical study examining the usability of current voice assistants among visually impaired individuals. We identify key pain points and propose a set of design guidelines for creating more inclusive voice assistants. Our contributions include (1) a taxonomy of accessibility features, (2) a user-centered approach to designing voice assistant personas, and (3) a prototype system that integrates our proposed features. Results from a user study demonstrate significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates.
