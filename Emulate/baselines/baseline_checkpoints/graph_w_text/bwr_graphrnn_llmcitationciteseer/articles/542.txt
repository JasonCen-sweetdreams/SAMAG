Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer user queries. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepHash', which leverages deep semantic hashing to efficiently retrieve top-k passages. We propose a neural network-based hash function that projects passages into a compact binary space, enabling fast lookup and ranking. Experimental results on popular ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that DeepHash outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in terms of both retrieval efficiency and answer accuracy.
