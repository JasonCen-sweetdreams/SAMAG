Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on effective passage retrieval to provide accurate answers. However, existing query formulation methods often fail to capture the nuances of the question, leading to suboptimal passage retrieval. This paper proposes an explainable query reformulation framework, 'ERRQ', which leverages a novel attention-based query encoder and a passage-centric relevance predictor. Our approach generates interpretable query reformulations that better capture the question intent, resulting in significant improvements in passage retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on the HotPotQA and NaturalQuestions datasets demonstrate the efficacy of ERRQ in enhancing ODQA performance.
