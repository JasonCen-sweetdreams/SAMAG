As document collections continue to grow, traditional query expansion techniques suffer from scalability issues, leading to decreased retrieval efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HyQE', which leverages a two-level indexing architecture to reduce the dimensionality of the query space. By adaptively selecting expansion terms from a hierarchical representation of the document collection, HyQE achieves significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and speed. Experiments on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that HyQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, with a 25% increase in mean average precision and a 3x reduction in query processing time.
