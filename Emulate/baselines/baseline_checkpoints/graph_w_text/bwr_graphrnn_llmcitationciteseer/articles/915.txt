The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources and decentralized energy management systems in smart grids necessitates efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper proposes a novel approach to coordinating autonomous agents using reinforcement learning, enabling real-time optimization of energy distribution and consumption. Our framework, 'AgentRL', leverages a multi-agent deep Q-network to learn optimal policies for agent coordination, taking into account uncertain renewable energy sources, variable demand, and grid constraints. Experimental results using real-world energy consumption data demonstrate improved efficiency and reduced energy waste compared to traditional optimization methods.
