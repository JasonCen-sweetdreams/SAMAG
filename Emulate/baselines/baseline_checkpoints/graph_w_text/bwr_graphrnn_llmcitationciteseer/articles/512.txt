Traditional document retrieval methods struggle with sparse domains, where relevant documents are scarce. We propose a query-driven document expansion approach to improve retrieval efficiency in such scenarios. Our method leverages a neural ranking model to generate pseudo-relevant documents, which are then used to augment the original query. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain, especially for tail queries. We also show that our approach is robust to varying levels of sparsity and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multiple evaluation metrics.
