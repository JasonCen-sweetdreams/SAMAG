Query expansion is a crucial component of semantic search systems, but existing methods often struggle with ambiguity in natural language queries. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages neural entity disambiguation to selectively expand query terms. We introduce a graph-based neural model that jointly learns entity representations and disambiguation, and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show significant gains over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, particularly for queries with ambiguous terms.
