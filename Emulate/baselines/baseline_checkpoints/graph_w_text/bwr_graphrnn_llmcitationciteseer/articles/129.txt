Few-shot learning on graph-structured data remains a challenging problem due to the limited availability of labeled data. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that leverages the hierarchical structure of graphs to learn more effective representations for few-shot learning tasks. HGAT uses a graph attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges at each hierarchy level, enabling the model to adapt to novel graph structures with limited training data. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot learning on graph-structured data, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness.
