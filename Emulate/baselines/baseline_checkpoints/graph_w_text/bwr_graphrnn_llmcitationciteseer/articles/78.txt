This paper presents a novel heterogeneous agent-based simulation framework for urban traffic management. We propose a multi-agent system that integrates different types of agents, including autonomous vehicles, human-driven vehicles, and pedestrians, to simulate real-world traffic scenarios. Our framework incorporates advanced traffic signal control, lane changing, and route planning strategies to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. Experimental results on a realistic urban traffic network demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing travel time, increasing traffic throughput, and improving overall traffic safety.
