Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on effective passage retrieval to identify relevant contexts for answer extraction. This paper proposes a hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach that leverages multi-granular dense representations to efficiently retrieve passages from a large corpus. Our method combines a coarse-grained retriever with a fine-grained ranker, allowing for efficient pruning of irrelevant passages while preserving accuracy. Experimental results on popular ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that HDR outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in terms of both retrieval quality and computational efficiency.
