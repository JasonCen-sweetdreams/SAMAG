Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel adaptive partitioning scheme, 'APart', which dynamically adjusts data placement and replication based on query patterns and workload characteristics. APart integrates a machine learning-based predictor to anticipate query access patterns and optimize data distribution accordingly. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate up to 3x improvement in query response times and 2x reduction in communication overhead compared to existing static partitioning schemes.
