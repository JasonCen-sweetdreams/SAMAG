Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their performance on accented speech remains a significant concern. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the recognition accuracy of three popular voice assistants on speech samples from non-native English speakers. We recruited 30 participants from diverse linguistic backgrounds and recorded their interactions with the voice assistants. Our results show that the current systems struggle to recognize accented speech, especially for less represented accents. We propose a set of design guidelines for developing more inclusive voice assistants, including the use of accent-agnostic training data and personalized adaptation mechanisms.
