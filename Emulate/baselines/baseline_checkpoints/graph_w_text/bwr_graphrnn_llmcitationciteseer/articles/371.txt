This paper explores the relationship between gestural interaction and spatial awareness in virtual reality (VR) environments. We conducted a user study to investigate how embodied cognition influences users' ability to navigate and understand virtual spaces. Our results show that gestural interaction can significantly enhance spatial awareness, particularly when combined with haptic feedback. We propose a novel framework for designing VR interfaces that leverages embodied cognition principles, and discuss implications for applications in education, training, and entertainment.
