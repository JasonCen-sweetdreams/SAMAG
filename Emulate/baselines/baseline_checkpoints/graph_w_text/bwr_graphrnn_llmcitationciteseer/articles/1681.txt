As augmented reality (AR) technology advances, natural and intuitive interaction mechanisms become crucial. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction system for AR, leveraging deep learning-based eye tracking. Our approach utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and track eye movements, achieving high accuracy and robustness in various lighting conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system through a user study, showcasing improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional input methods. The proposed system has significant implications for enhancing the AR experience in various applications, including gaming, education, and healthcare.
