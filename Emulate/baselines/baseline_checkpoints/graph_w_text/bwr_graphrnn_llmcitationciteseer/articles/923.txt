Node classification on graph-structured data is a fundamental task in various domains. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand their decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to capture node representations. We demonstrate that HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while providing visualizable attention weights that reveal insightful patterns in the graph structure. Experimental results and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of HGAT for interpretable node classification.
