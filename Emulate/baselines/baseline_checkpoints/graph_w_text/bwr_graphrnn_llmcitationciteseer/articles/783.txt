Individuals with visual impairments face significant challenges when interacting with digital interfaces. This paper presents 'GazeGuide', a novel gaze-based adaptive navigation system designed to facilitate seamless interaction for visually impaired users. By leveraging machine learning-based gaze tracking and adaptive interface manipulation, GazeGuide enables users to efficiently navigate complex interfaces without relying on explicit input. Our user study with 20 visually impaired participants demonstrates a significant reduction in task completion time and improved user satisfaction compared to traditional navigation methods.
