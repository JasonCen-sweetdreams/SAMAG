Medical information retrieval (IR) is a challenging task due to the complexity and nuance of medical terminology. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, specifically designed for medical IR. Our model, MedExp, leverages a combination of word embeddings and convolutional neural networks to identify relevant expansion terms from a large corpus of medical texts. Experimental results on a standard medical IR dataset show that MedExp significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a mean average precision improvement of 15.2%. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of MedExp in improving retrieval performance on a real-world medical IR system.
