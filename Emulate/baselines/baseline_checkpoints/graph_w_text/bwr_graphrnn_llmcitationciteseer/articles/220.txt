Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in social skills training, but the role of embodied avatars in enhancing training effectiveness remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of embodied avatar representation on social skills improvement in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We designed a VR-based training platform that utilized either an embodied avatar or a non-embodied interface. Results from a mixed-design experiment (N=40) indicate that participants who used the embodied avatar condition showed significant improvements in social skills, particularly in initiating and maintaining conversations, compared to the non-embodied condition. Our findings suggest that embodied avatars can play a crucial role in enhancing the effectiveness of VR-based social skills training for individuals with ASD.
