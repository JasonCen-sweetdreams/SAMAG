Distributed database systems are widely used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query workloads remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. We design a Markov decision process (MDP) that models the query optimization problem and propose a deep Q-network (DQN) based algorithm to learn the optimal query execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
