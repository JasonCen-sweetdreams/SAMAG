Traditional query expansion techniques struggle to capture nuanced semantic relationships in heterogeneous document collections. We propose a novel approach, 'DeepExp', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate context-aware query expansions. By incorporating a semantic relevance scorer and a hierarchical clustering algorithm, DeepExp significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reduces computational overhead. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-domain corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in retrieving relevant documents with diverse semantic relationships.
