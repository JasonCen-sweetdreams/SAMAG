Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of users with cognitive or motor impairments. This study explores the impact of cognitive load on user experience with voice assistants, particularly for individuals with disabilities. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, using a custom-built voice assistant platform. Our results show that users with higher cognitive load exhibit decreased accuracy and increased frustration when interacting with voice assistants. We propose a set of design guidelines and recommendations for developing more inclusive voice assistants, incorporating features such as adaptive prompt timing and personalized feedback.
