Traditional document retrieval methods rely on bag-of-words representations, which fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships between documents. This paper introduces Hierarchical Neural Document Embeddings (HNDE), a novel approach that leverages hierarchical transformers to learn document representations. HNDE captures both local and global context, enabling efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly for long-document retrieval tasks.
