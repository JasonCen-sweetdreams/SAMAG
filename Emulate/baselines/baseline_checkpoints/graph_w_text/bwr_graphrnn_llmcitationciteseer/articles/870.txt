Modern search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from massive indexes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages semantic relationships between query terms to improve retrieval accuracy. HQE adaptively selects expansion terms based on their contextual relevance, and organizes them into a hierarchical structure to reduce redundancy and improve query representation. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision at top-10 retrieved documents.
