In large-scale multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph-based reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. We model the agents' communication network as a graph and employ a novel graph neural network architecture to learn a policy that maximizes the system's overall performance. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead compared to traditional centralized methods.
