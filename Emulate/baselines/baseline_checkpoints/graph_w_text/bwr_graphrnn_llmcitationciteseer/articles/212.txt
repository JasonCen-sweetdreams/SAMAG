Distributed database systems are widely used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query performance remains a daunting task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively adjust query execution plans in response to changing workload conditions. Our framework, 'RL-Qopt', uses a deep Q-network to select the optimal join order, indexing strategy, and data replication scheme for each query. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database benchmark demonstrate that RL-Qopt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 35% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
