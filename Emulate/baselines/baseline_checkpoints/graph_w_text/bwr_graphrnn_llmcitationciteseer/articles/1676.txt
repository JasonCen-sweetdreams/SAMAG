Knowledge graphs have become a crucial component in various applications, including artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and data integration. However, querying large-scale knowledge graphs remains a significant challenge due to their massive size and complexity. This paper presents DRAGON, a distributed RDF graph query optimization framework that leverages a novel combination of graph partitioning, query rewriting, and parallel processing techniques. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that DRAGON achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimization approaches, making it a promising solution for scalable knowledge graph querying.
