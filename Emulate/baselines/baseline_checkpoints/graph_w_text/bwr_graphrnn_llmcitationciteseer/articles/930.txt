Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it directly affects the relevance and quality of retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, which leverages the strengths of both language models and semantic embeddings. Our proposed method, 'DeepQE', uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively expand query terms based on their contextual importance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
