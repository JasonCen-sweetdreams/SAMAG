Distributed databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management. However, optimizing query execution in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and network topology. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on execution time and resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
