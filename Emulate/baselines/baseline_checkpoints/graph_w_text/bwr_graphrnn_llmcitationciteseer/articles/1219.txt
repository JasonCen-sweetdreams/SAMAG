Autonomous vehicles require complex control policies that can handle diverse scenarios and tasks. This paper presents a multi-task deep reinforcement learning framework, 'MT-DRL', that learns to control autonomous vehicles in various environments and scenarios. Our approach uses a shared policy network that learns to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as lane following, obstacle avoidance, and traffic signal recognition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MT-DRL on a realistic simulation platform, achieving improved performance and adaptability compared to single-task learning methods.
