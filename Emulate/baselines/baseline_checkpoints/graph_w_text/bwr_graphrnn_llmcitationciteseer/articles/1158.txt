The proliferation of semi-structured documents in modern information systems has created new challenges for efficient retrieval. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'HybridIR', which combines the benefits of inverted indexing and graph-based indexing to support fast and scalable retrieval of semi-structured documents in distributed information retrieval systems. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HybridIR achieves significant improvements in query response time and retrieval accuracy compared to existing indexing methods, while maintaining a low storage overhead.
