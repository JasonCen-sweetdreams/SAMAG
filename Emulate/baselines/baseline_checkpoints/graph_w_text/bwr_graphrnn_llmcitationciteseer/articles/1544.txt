This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated traffic signal control. We model each traffic signal as an autonomous agent that learns to optimize its signal timing policy based on real-time traffic conditions and communication with neighboring agents. Our approach, called 'TrafficAgent', employs a novel graph neural network architecture to represent the complex traffic network topology and facilitates efficient information sharing among agents. Experimental results using real-world traffic data demonstrate that TrafficAgent reduces congestion and travel times by up to 25% compared to traditional, centrally controlled signal timing strategies.
