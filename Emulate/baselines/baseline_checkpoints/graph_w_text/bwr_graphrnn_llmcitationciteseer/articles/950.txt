Explainable AI (XAI) has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in decision support systems (DSS) where model interpretability is crucial. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that integrates XAI principles into DSS. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between variables and hierarchically aggregates features to provide transparent and contextual explanations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in a real-world healthcare DSS, achieving improved model performance and enhanced explainability compared to state-of-the-art XAI methods.
