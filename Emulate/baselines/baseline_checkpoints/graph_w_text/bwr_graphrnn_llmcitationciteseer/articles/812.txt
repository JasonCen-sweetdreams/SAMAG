Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval that aims to refine user queries to better match relevant documents. Traditional methods rely on term co-occurrence and frequency-based approaches, which often struggle to capture nuanced semantic relationships. This paper proposes a novel neural embedding-based query expansion framework, 'NEQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to encode query terms and documents into dense vector spaces. We demonstrate that NEQE significantly improves retrieval effectiveness by incorporating contextualized semantic information, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.
