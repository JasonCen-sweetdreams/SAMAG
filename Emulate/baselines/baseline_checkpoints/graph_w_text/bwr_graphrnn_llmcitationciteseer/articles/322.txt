Imbalanced classification problems, where one class has a significantly larger number of instances than the others, are prevalent in many real-world applications. Online learning algorithms are often employed to handle streaming data, but they can struggle with class imbalance. This paper proposes a novel online learning framework, 'AdReg', which incorporates adaptive regularization to tackle class imbalance. AdReg dynamically adjusts the regularization strength based on the class distribution and the model's performance, leading to improved accuracy and robustness. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AdReg in handling imbalanced classification tasks.
