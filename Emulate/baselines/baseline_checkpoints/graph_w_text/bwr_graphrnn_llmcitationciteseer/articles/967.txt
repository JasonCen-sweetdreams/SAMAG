Column-oriented NoSQL databases have gained popularity in big data analytics due to their ability to efficiently store and query large amounts of data. However, indexing mechanisms for these databases remain inadequate, leading to poor query performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'ComboIndex', which leverages the columnar storage layout to create a hybrid index that combines the benefits of B-tree and bitmap indexes. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that ComboIndex outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 3x in query execution time while reducing storage overhead by 25%.
