Retrieval-based question answering systems rely on effective query representation to retrieve relevant passages. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method using hierarchical graph attention networks (HGAT). Our approach models the query as a graph, where nodes represent terms and edges capture semantic relationships. HGAT learns to attend to relevant terms and their relationships, generating a expanded query that better captures the question's intent. Experiments on the SQuAD and HotPotQA datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval recall and end-to-end question answering accuracy.
