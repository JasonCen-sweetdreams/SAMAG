Lane change maneuvers are a crucial aspect of autonomous vehicle navigation. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'LaneChanger', which utilizes a hierarchical architecture to learn lane change policies from raw sensor data. Our approach incorporates a high-level intention network to predict the driver's intent and a low-level control network to execute the lane change. We evaluate LaneChanger on a realistic simulation environment and demonstrate improved safety and efficiency compared to traditional rule-based approaches.
