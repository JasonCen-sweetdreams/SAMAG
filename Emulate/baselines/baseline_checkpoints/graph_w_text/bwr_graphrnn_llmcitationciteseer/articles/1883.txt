Real-time analytics on large-scale time-series data is crucial in various applications, such as IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, existing indexing techniques are often limited by their inability to handle high ingestion rates and diverse query patterns. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'TSIX', which leverages a combination of hierarchical Bloom filters and adaptive sampling to achieve efficient query processing and low memory footprint. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that TSIX outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of query latency and throughput while maintaining high accuracy.
