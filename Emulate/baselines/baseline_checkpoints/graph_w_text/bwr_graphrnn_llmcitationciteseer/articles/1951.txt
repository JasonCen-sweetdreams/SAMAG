Short-text retrieval is a challenging task in information retrieval due to the limited context available. Query expansion techniques can improve retrieval performance, but often rely on term co-occurrence statistics or manual feature engineering. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'CAQE', which leverages context-aware embeddings to model the semantic relationships between query terms and document content. Our method incorporates a graph-based attention mechanism to adaptively weight the importance of contextual information. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly for short queries.
