Augmented reality (AR) technology has improved significantly in recent years, but user interaction remains a major bottleneck. We propose a novel gaze-based interaction system using deep learning, which enables users to seamlessly interact with virtual objects in AR environments. Our approach leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect and track user gaze, and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict user intentions. We evaluate our system using a user study and demonstrate improved interaction accuracy and user experience compared to existing methods.
