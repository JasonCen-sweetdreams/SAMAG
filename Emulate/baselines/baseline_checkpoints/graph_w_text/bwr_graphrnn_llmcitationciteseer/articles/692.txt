Ad-hoc retrieval remains a crucial task in information retrieval, where query expansion is a key technique to improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, leveraging dense vector embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our method, dubbed 'EmbedExpan', learns a joint embedding space using a combination of word2vec and doc2vec, enabling efficient query expansion through vector operations. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvement in mean average precision and recall compared to traditional query expansion methods.
