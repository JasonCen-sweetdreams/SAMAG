In distributed database systems, multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) enables high availability and concurrency, but introduces query optimization challenges. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MVCCOpt', which leverages graph-based modeling and reinforcement learning to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. We propose a dynamic version selection strategy that adapts to workload changes and explores the tradeoff between query performance and data freshness. Experimental results on a distributed database prototype demonstrate that MVCCOpt outperforms existing optimization techniques by up to 35% in query latency and 25% in system throughput.
