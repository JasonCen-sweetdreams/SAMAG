Graph-based models have shown promising results in document retrieval tasks, but they often suffer from high computational complexity and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture that efficiently models complex document relationships and retrieves relevant documents. Our approach uses a hierarchical graph structure to capture both local and global document features, and employs attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
