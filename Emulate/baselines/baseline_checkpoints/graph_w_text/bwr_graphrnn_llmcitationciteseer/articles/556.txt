This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to create more intuitive and engaging user experiences. We propose a gesture-based interaction framework that leverages the cognitive benefits of bodily engagement to improve user performance and satisfaction in VR environments. Our study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative measurements of user behavior with qualitative assessments of user experience. Results show that our framework significantly enhances user engagement, spatial awareness, and task performance compared to traditional controller-based interfaces.
