Gesture-based authentication in virtual reality (VR) is gaining popularity, but the role of visual feedback in enhancing security and usability remains understudied. We investigate the effect of different visual feedback types on the performance and user experience of gesture-based authentication in VR. Our user study involving 40 participants reveals that providing real-time visual feedback of gesture trajectories can significantly improve authentication accuracy and reduce error rates. However, we also observe a trade-off between security and usability, as more detailed feedback can compromise gesture secrecy. Our findings inform the design of more effective and user-friendly gesture-based authentication systems for VR applications.
