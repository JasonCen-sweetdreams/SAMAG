Multi-agent systems often struggle to cooperate in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce HGA-Net, a novel hierarchical graph attention network architecture that enables effective cooperation among multiple agents. HGA-Net leverages attention mechanisms to focus on relevant neighboring agents and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results on a variety of multi-agent benchmarks demonstrate that HGA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of cooperation efficiency, adaptability, and scalability.
