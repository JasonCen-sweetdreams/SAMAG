Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their benefits are often inaccessible to older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, 'CARE', tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted contextual inquiries and co-design workshops with caregivers and older adults to identify design requirements. Our prototype incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified dialogue flows, visual feedback, and emotional support. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing more accessible voice assistants.
