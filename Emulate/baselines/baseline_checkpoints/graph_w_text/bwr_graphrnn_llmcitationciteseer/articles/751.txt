This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for smart grids using multi-agent reinforcement learning. The framework, called 'SmartAlloc', enables autonomous agents to adaptively allocate tasks in real-time, optimizing energy efficiency and reducing peak demand. We develop a novel, hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture that integrates both local and global reward signals, allowing agents to learn effective task allocation strategies in a decentralized manner. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid environment demonstrate that SmartAlloc outperforms traditional, centralized allocation methods, achieving up to 15% reduction in peak demand and 20% improvement in energy efficiency.
