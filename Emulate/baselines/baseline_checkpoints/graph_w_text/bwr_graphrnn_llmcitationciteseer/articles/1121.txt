Real-time resource allocation in smart grids is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a novel heterogeneous agent-based system, called 'GridAgent', which integrates multiple agents with different expertise and coordination mechanisms to optimize resource allocation. We propose a decentralized Markov decision process (MDP) framework that enables agents to learn and adapt to changing grid conditions, while ensuring scalability and robustness. Experimental results on a realistic testbed demonstrate that GridAgent outperforms traditional centralized optimization methods in terms of response time, energy efficiency, and fault tolerance.
