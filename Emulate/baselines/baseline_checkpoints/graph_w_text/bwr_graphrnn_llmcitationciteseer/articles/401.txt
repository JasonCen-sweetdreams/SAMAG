Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, but its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect adversarial attacks in DRL using Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (TGCTs). Our method leverages the graph structure of the environment to capture temporal dependencies and identify anomalous patterns indicative of attacks. We evaluate our approach on a suite of Atari games and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting various types of attacks, including ones with high semantic similarity to legitimate inputs.
