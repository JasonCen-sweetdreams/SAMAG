With the growing adoption of cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms, multitenancy has become a key concern. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MTQO', designed specifically for multitenant DBaaS environments. MTQO leverages a probabilistic model to predict query execution times and adapts to workload changes in real-time. We propose a hierarchical optimization approach that combines static analysis, runtime profiling, and machine learning-based prediction to minimize query latency and improve resource utilization. Experimental results on a production-scale DBaaS platform show that MTQO reduces average query response times by up to 35% compared to state-of-the-art methods.
