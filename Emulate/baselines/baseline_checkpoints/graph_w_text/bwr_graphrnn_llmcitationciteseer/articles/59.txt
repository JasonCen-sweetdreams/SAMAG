Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems rely on bag-of-words representations, which fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships between documents. This paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Semantic Embeddings (HSE), which learns a hierarchical graph neural network to encode documents as dense vectors. HSE leverages both local and global contextual information to capture semantic hierarchies, enabling more accurate and efficient document retrieval. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 25% relative increase in retrieval precision.
