In decentralized multi-agent planning, individual agents often possess unique information that can significantly impact collective decision-making. However, agents may be reluctant to share their knowledge due to concerns about information leakage or exploitation. This paper introduces a novel framework, 'InfoShare', which incentivizes agents to share their information by deploying a reputation-based mechanism that rewards trustworthy behavior. We demonstrate that InfoShare leads to improved collective performance and enhances the overall robustness of the multi-agent system. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario showcase the effectiveness of our approach in promoting cooperative information exchange.
