Document clustering is a fundamental task in information retrieval, but existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity or poor scalability. This paper presents a novel hierarchical document clustering approach, 'HDC-AD', which leverages adaptive density-based methods to efficiently identify clusters of varying densities. HDC-AD incorporates a dynamic thresholding strategy that adjusts to the local density of each document, enabling effective clustering of documents with diverse characteristics. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HDC-AD over state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency.
