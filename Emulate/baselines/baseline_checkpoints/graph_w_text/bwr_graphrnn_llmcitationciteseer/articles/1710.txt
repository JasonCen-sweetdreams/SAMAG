In complex systems, multiple agents with diverse capabilities and objectives need to coordinate to allocate shared resources efficiently. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework, 'CoRLA', which enables heterogeneous agents to learn cooperative strategies for multi-resource allocation. We introduce a novel attention-based architecture that integrates agent-specific knowledge graphs, facilitating the exchange of information and the formation of coalitions. Experimental results on a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate that CoRLA outperforms traditional distributed optimization methods in terms of resource utilization and system stability.
