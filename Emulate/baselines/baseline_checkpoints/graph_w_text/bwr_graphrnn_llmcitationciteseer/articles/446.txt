Clustering large-scale image datasets remains a challenging task due to the curse of dimensionality and computational complexity. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach, 'DeepHier', which leverages the representational power of deep neural networks to learn a hierarchical structure of image clusters. We introduce a new loss function that encourages the formation of compact and well-separated clusters, and demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepHier on several benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that DeepHier outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency.
