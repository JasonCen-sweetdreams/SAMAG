The increasing scale of document collections has made efficient retrieval a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HiNeR, which leverages both local and global document representations to improve retrieval efficiency. HiNeR uses a cascade of neural ranking models, each operating on a subset of the collection, to prune irrelevant documents and focus on the most relevant ones. Experimental results on several large-scale collections demonstrate that HiNeR achieves significant improvements in both retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
