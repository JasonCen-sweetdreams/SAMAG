Decentralized edge computing (DEC) enables efficient resource allocation and reduced latency in IoT applications. This paper proposes a novel agent-based framework, 'AURA', which leverages multi-agent systems to optimize resource allocation in DEC environments. AURA employs a distributed, auction-based mechanism that allows edge devices to autonomously bid for resources, ensuring efficient allocation and minimizing latency. We demonstrate AURA's scalability and performance through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, showcasing its potential for large-scale DEC deployments.
