The proliferation of short-text documents on social media and online forums poses significant challenges for information retrieval systems. This paper presents a novel hybrid semantic indexing approach that combines the benefits of traditional keyword-based indexing with semantic embeddings. Our method leverages a hierarchical clustering approach to group semantically similar documents, allowing for efficient filtering and ranking of search results. Experimental evaluations on a large short-text dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and query processing time compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
