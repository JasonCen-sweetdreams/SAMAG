Traditional document ranking methods rely on hand-crafted features and simplistic scoring functions, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel context-aware document ranking framework, 'DeepRank', which leverages deep neural networks to model complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant contextual information, enabling more accurate ranking of relevant documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in mean average precision compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
