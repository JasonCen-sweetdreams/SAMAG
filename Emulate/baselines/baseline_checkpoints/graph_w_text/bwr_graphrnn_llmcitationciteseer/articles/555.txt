Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a crucial technique for various artificial intelligence applications. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational costs and neglect the hierarchical structure of relations in knowledge graphs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel KGE framework, 'HIERA', which leverages hierarchical relation attention to selectively focus on relevant relational patterns. Our approach reduces the number of parameters and computations required while improving the quality of embeddings. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HIERA over state-of-the-art methods in link prediction and entity classification tasks.
