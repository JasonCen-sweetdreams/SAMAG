This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems for real-time traffic management using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'TrafficCTRL', where each agent learns to optimize traffic signal control policies in a distributed manner. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model complex traffic patterns and incorporates a reward function that balances traffic flow, safety, and fairness. Experimental results on a large-scale traffic simulation platform demonstrate that TrafficCTRL outperforms traditional optimization methods and achieves significant reductions in travel time and congestion.
