Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in data integration and cleaning, where the goal is to identify the correct entity (e.g., person, organization, location) referred to by an ambiguous mention. This paper presents a novel graph-based collective inference approach that leverages the relational structure between entities to improve disambiguation accuracy. Our approach, 'GraphDisamb', uses a probabilistic graphical model to jointly disambiguate entities and their relationships, and incorporates a scalable iterative inference algorithm to handle large datasets. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphDisamb outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability.
