Ad-hoc search is a fundamental task in information retrieval (IR) where the search system must retrieve relevant documents for a given query. However, the performance of IR systems is often limited by the quality of the query. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. Our approach, called 'NeuroQE', uses a transformer-based architecture to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and generates expanded queries that improve retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant gains in precision and recall.
