Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have gained popularity for their scalability and ease of use. However, optimizing query performance in multi-tenant environments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'OptiMT', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and graph-based techniques to minimize query latency and resource contention. We introduce a hierarchical query clustering approach that identifies opportunities for shared execution and caching, resulting in improved throughput and reduced tail latency. Experimental evaluation on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrates OptiMT's ability to achieve up to 3x query performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
