Multi-agent planning is a challenging task, particularly in complex, dynamic environments. Explainability is crucial for real-world adoption, but most existing methods sacrifice transparency for performance. This paper presents HAN-MAP, a hierarchical attention network that integrates planning and explanation in a unified framework. HAN-MAP leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents, actions, and contexts, generating interpretable plans and explanations. Our experiments on a diverse range of scenarios demonstrate that HAN-MAP achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing insightful explanations, enabling more effective human-agent collaboration.
