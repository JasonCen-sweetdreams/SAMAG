Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to retrieve relevant documents due to the complexities of natural language queries. Query expansion (QE) techniques can improve retrieval effectiveness, but existing methods rely on hand-crafted rules or limited training data. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn query reformulation strategies. Our method uses a Markov decision process to model the QE process and trains an agent to select optimal expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance over state-of-the-art QE methods.
