Voice assistants have the potential to improve the lives of older adults, but current designs often neglect their unique needs and abilities. This study employs a participatory design approach, involving 20 older adults in the co-design of a voice assistant tailored to their requirements. We identify key design considerations, including clear and simple voice prompts, flexible dialogue flows, and minimal error handling. Our findings inform the development of a prototype voice assistant, which is evaluated through a usability study with 30 older adults. Results show significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to existing commercial voice assistants.
