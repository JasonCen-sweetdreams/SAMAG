Gesture-based virtual reality (VR) interfaces often rely on visual and auditory cues, neglecting the tactile sense. This paper presents a novel framework for designing tactile feedback for VR gestures, enhancing user experience and immersion. We conducted a user study to identify key gesture categories and developed a tactile feedback vocabulary based on haptic rendering and vibration patterns. Our evaluation shows that the proposed framework improves gesture recognition accuracy and reduces user fatigue. We also provide guidelines for integrating tactile feedback into VR interface design, promoting a more multisensory and engaging experience.
