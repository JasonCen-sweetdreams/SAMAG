Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in knowledge graph construction, where the goal is to resolve ambiguity in entity references. Existing approaches rely on hand-crafted features or graph-based methods, which suffer from scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'KG-Embed', which leverages knowledge graph embeddings to disambiguate entities. We exploit the structural properties of knowledge graphs to learn dense vector representations of entities and their context, enabling efficient disambiguation. Experimental results on large-scale datasets demonstrate that KG-Embed outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability.
