We present a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for autonomous traffic signal control. Our method, called 'SmartSignal', leverages real-time traffic data to optimize signal timings and minimize congestion. Each agent, representing a signalized intersection, learns to adapt its control policy based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. We evaluate SmartSignal on a large-scale simulation of the Pittsburgh traffic network, demonstrating significant reductions in travel time and emissions compared to traditional fixed-time and actuated control strategies.
