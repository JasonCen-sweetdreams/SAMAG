This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation using self-organizing agents in dynamic environments. We propose an agent-based framework that leverages local interactions and decentralized decision-making to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Our approach utilizes a multi-objective optimization strategy to balance task completion time, resource utilization, and agent autonomy. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient task allocation and robustness to environmental disturbances.
