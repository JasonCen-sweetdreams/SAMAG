Ad-hoc search in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is a challenging task due to the complexity of relationships between entities. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NQE-HIN', that leverages graph neural networks to capture the contextualized relationships between entities in the query and the HIN. Our approach learns to expand the query by incorporating relevant entities and their relationships, resulting in improved retrieval performance and efficiency. Experimental results on three real-world HIN datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NQE-HIN compared to state-of-the-art ad-hoc search methods.
