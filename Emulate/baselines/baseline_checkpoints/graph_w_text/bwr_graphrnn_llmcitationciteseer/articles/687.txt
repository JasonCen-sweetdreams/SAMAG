The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of time-series data, demanding real-time data warehousing solutions that can efficiently support complex queries. This paper introduces 'RT-IOTA', a novel indexing framework that leverages a hybrid approach combining column-store indexing and in-memory caching. We propose an adaptive partitioning strategy that dynamically adjusts to changing data velocities and query patterns, ensuring consistent query performance and minimizing storage overhead. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate RT-IOTA's ability to support real-time analytics while achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
