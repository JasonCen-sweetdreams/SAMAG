The increasing volume of semi-structured data in distributed systems has created a need for efficient retrieval mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the benefits of inverted indexing and graph-based indexing. Our approach, called HybridIndex, utilizes a distributed architecture to index semi-structured data and supports efficient query processing. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HybridIndex outperforms existing indexing techniques in terms of query response time and scalability.
