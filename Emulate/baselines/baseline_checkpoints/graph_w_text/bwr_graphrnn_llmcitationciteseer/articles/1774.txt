Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem due to the complexity of interactions between agents and the environment. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn coordination policies for task allocation. We introduce a hierarchical framework, 'MACTA', that uses a centralized critic to evaluate the global performance of the system and decentralized actors to learn task allocation policies. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm dataset demonstrate that MACTA outperforms traditional decentralized approaches and achieves near-optimal task allocation in complex scenarios.
