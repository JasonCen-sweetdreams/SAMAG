Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, which involves ranking documents based on their relevance to a given query. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for efficient document ranking. Our approach consists of a high-level policy that selects a subset of documents to evaluate, and a low-level policy that determines the ranking of the selected documents. We employ a reinforcement learning objective that maximizes the expected cumulative discounted reward, where the reward function is based on the relevance of the ranked documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HRL approach outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
