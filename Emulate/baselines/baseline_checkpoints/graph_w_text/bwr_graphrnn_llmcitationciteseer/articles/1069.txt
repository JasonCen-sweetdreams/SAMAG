This paper presents a decentralized reinforcement learning framework for coordinating multi-agent systems in resource allocation tasks. We propose a novel algorithm, 'MARL-RA', that enables agents to learn decentralized policies through self-organization and adaptation. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and resource dependencies, allowing agents to make autonomous decisions that maximize global utility. Experimental results on a realistic resource allocation scenario demonstrate that MARL-RA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of scalability, adaptability, and overall system efficiency.
