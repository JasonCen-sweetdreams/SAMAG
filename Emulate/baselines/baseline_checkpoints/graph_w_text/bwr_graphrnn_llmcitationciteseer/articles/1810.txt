Few-shot image classification remains a challenging task, particularly when faced with limited labeled data. This paper presents a novel hierarchical contrastive learning framework, 'HiCo', which leverages both local and global feature representations to improve classification accuracy. By hierarchically clustering samples and adapting the contrastive loss function, HiCo learns more discriminative features and reduces the impact of noisy labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiCo outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods, while requiring fewer computational resources.
