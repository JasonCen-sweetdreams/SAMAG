With the increasing adoption of voice-based interfaces, personalization has become a crucial aspect of enhancing user experience. This study explores the effects of personalization on user satisfaction, engagement, and efficiency in voice-based interactions. We designed a controlled experiment involving 120 participants, where we manipulated the level of personalization in a smart speaker system. Our results show that personalized voice responses improve user satisfaction and engagement, but may compromise efficiency due to increased response time. We also identify individual differences in user preferences and discuss implications for designing personalized voice-based interfaces.
