In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient allocation of tasks to agents with heterogeneous capabilities. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework, 'HeteroAssign', which leverages graph neural networks to learn agent capabilities and task affinities. We develop a distributed optimization algorithm that minimizes task latency and maximizes system utility, while respecting agent capacity constraints. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HeteroAssign outperforms state-of-the-art centralized and decentralized approaches, achieving up to 30% reduction in task latency and 25% improvement in system utility.
