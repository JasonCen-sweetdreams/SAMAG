This paper presents a novel deep learning architecture for graph-based dependency parsing, leveraging recursive neural networks to model hierarchical graph structures. Our approach, dubbed 'RecDep', recursively applies a graph convolutional network to capture complex dependencies between nodes, enabling the parser to accurately predict subtree structures. Experimental results on the English Penn Treebank dataset demonstrate that RecDep achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing graph-based parsers by a significant margin.
