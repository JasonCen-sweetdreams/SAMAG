Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their usability for older adults remains a concern. This paper presents a participatory design study involving 20 older adults (ages 65-85) to identify the barriers and opportunities in designing accessible conversational interfaces. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise language, visual feedback, and explicit error handling. We propose a set of design guidelines and a novel interface framework, 'EasyChat', which incorporates these insights. A usability evaluation with 12 older adults shows that EasyChat improves conversational flow and reduces user frustration compared to existing interfaces.
