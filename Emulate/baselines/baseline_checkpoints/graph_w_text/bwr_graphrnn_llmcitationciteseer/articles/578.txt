In complex multi-agent systems, autonomous negotiation is crucial for achieving efficient and fair outcomes. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous negotiation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a hierarchical framework that integrates a deep Q-network with a negotiation protocol, enabling agents to adapt to changing environments and opponent strategies. Experimental results on a variety of negotiation scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of negotiation outcomes, convergence speed, and robustness to opponent types.
