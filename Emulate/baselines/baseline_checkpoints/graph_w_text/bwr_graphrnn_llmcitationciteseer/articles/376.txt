Deep learning-based recommender systems have shown remarkable success in personalized recommendation tasks. However, they are often vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can drastically degrade their performance. This paper proposes a novel adversarial training approach, 'AdvRec', specifically designed for deep recommender systems. AdvRec leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) to craft realistic and diverse adversarial examples, which are then used to augment the training data. Our extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdvRec significantly improves the robustness of deep recommender systems against various types of attacks, including data poisoning and model inversion attacks.
