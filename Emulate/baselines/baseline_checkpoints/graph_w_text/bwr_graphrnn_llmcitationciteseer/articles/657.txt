Ad-hoc search is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a technique used to improve the retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. We propose a neural dense retrieval approach for query expansion, which leverages the semantic similarities between query terms and document representations. Our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as Rocchio and relevance feedback, on several benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that our approach can be efficiently integrated into a real-world search engine, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance.
