Autonomous traffic management requires efficient coordination among multiple agents, such as traffic lights and vehicles. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize the coordination of multi-agent systems in real-time traffic scenarios. We introduce a decentralized, hierarchical framework that combines graph neural networks with multi-agent deep Q-networks to learn cooperative policies. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in traffic flow and reduction in congestion compared to traditional, rule-based approaches. The proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize urban traffic management and pave the way for more efficient and sustainable transportation systems.
