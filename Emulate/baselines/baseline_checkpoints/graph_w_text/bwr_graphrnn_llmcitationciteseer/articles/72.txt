Short-text retrieval remains a challenging task in modern search engines, mainly due to the lack of contextual information. This paper proposes a novel approach for query expansion using deep semantic representation. Our method, dubbed 'SemExpan', leverages a pre-trained language model to generate a set of semantically similar keywords for a given query. We then incorporate these keywords into a probabilistic retrieval framework, allowing the model to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and document content. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
