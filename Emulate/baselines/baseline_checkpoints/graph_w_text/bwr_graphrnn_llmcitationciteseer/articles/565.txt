The increasing complexity of IoT networks has made them vulnerable to various types of cyber threats. Traditional centralized intrusion detection systems (IDS) are often ineffective in detecting anomalies in real-time, leading to delayed response times. This paper proposes a decentralized agent-based IDS framework, 'DAID', which leverages autonomous agents to monitor and respond to threats in a distributed manner. Each agent is equipped with a machine learning-based anomaly detection module and communicates with its peers to exchange threat intelligence. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that DAID achieves a 30% improvement in detection accuracy and a 50% reduction in response time compared to traditional centralized IDS approaches.
