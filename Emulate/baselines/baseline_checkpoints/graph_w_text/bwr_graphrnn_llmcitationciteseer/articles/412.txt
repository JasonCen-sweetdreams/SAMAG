The proliferation of IoT devices has led to a surge in resource allocation challenges. This paper presents a novel decentralized autonomous agent-based framework for efficient resource allocation in IoT networks. Our approach leverages multi-agent systems to enable devices to negotiate and allocate resources in a distributed manner, minimizing latency and improving overall network performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulations on a real-world IoT network, showcasing significant improvements in resource utilization and reduced overhead compared to traditional centralized methods.
