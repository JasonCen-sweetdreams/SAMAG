Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must coordinate to accomplish tasks without a central authority. This paper proposes a novel approach using attention-based graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn decentralized task allocation policies. We model the agent-task graph and design a GNN architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agent-task interactions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario show that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized methods, achieving higher task completion rates and improved system efficiency.
