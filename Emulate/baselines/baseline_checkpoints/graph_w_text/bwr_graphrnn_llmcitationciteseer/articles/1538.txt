Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DistroOpt', which leverages machine learning and graph-based techniques to efficiently explore the query optimization search space. We introduce a distributed cost estimation model that accurately predicts query execution times, and a genetic algorithm-based search strategy that adaptively prunes the search space. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark show that DistroOpt outperforms existing query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
