Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods rely on manual intervention or simplistic statistical models. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to capture semantic relationships between query terms. We introduce a ranking-based approach that incorporates both local and global context to generate high-quality expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while requiring minimal human intervention.
