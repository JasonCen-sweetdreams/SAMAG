Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-structured data, where a model must generalize to new classes with limited labeled examples. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAT-GNN) that leverages both local and global graph structure to learn transferable node representations. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant nodes and subgraphs, enabling the model to adapt to new classes with few examples. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAT-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification tasks, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness.
