Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches struggle to scale to large datasets. This paper presents a novel method that combines knowledge graph embeddings with graph attention mechanisms to efficiently disambiguate entities. Our approach, called GraphED, learns to represent entities as dense vectors in a low-dimensional space, and then uses graph attention to selectively focus on relevant neighboring entities and contextual information during disambiguation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising solution for large-scale knowledge graph construction.
