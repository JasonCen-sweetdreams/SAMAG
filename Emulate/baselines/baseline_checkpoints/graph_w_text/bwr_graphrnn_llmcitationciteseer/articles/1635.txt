In multi-agent systems, effective coordination is crucial for achieving complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework for learning coordination strategies in decentralized environments. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent interactions and hierarchical structures to capture long-range dependencies. We evaluate HGAT on a range of benchmarks, including traffic signal control and robotic swarm navigation, and demonstrate significant improvements in coordination efficiency and task performance compared to existing methods.
