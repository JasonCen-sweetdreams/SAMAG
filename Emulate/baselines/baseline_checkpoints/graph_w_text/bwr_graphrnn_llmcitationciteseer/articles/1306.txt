Query optimization is a crucial step in relational database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'GQN', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to optimize query plans. We represent the query plan space as a graph, where nodes correspond to query operators and edges represent dependencies between them. By training a GNN to predict the optimal query plan, we demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and memory usage compared to traditional optimization techniques. Experimental results on the TPC-H benchmark show that GQN outperforms state-of-the-art optimization algorithms by up to 3.5x.
