Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel approach to passage retrieval using sparse document representations, which reduce the dimensionality of the document embedding space and enable faster similarity computations. Our method, dubbed 'SparseDPR', leverages a hierarchical clustering algorithm to create a sparse representation of documents, allowing for efficient indexing and retrieval of top-k relevant passages. Experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that SparseDPR achieves state-of-the-art passage retrieval performance while reducing computational overhead by up to 70% compared to existing dense representation-based methods.
