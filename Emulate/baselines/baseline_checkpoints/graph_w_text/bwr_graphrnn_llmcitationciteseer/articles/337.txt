Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their effectiveness for older adults is hindered by limited accessibility and usability. This study explores the design of inclusive voice assistants tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, using a conversational interaction framework to analyze their voice assistant interactions. Our findings highlight the importance of explicit error handling, personalized dialogue management, and multimodal feedback. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating age-friendly voice assistants, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates.
