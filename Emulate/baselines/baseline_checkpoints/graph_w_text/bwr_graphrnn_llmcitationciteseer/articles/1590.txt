Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, are increasingly prevalent in everyday life. However, people with disabilities often face significant barriers in interacting with these systems. This paper presents the design and evaluation of AccessChat, a novel conversational interface that incorporates accessibility features to support users with disabilities. We employed a participatory design approach, working closely with individuals with disabilities to identify and address usability challenges. Our evaluation demonstrates that AccessChat significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction for participants with disabilities, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in HCI.
