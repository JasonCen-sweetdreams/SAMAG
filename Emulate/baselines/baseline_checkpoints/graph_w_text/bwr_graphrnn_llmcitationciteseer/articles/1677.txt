Commonsense reasoning (CSR) is a fundamental AI capability that enables machines to reason about everyday situations. Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) is a key technique for CSR, but existing methods struggle with scalability and capturing hierarchical relationships. We propose a novel KGE framework, 'HierAtt', which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between entities and concepts. Our experiments on the ConceptNet dataset demonstrate that HierAtt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in CSR tasks, achieving a 12.5% improvement in accuracy while reducing computational overhead by 30%.
