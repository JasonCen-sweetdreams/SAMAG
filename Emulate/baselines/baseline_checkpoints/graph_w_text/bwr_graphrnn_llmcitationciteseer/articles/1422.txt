Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in DDS due to the complexity of data distribution and partitioning. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using learned indexes, which leverages machine learning models to predict the optimal query execution plan. We introduce a hybrid indexing scheme that combines traditional B-tree indexes with learned indexes, allowing for efficient query optimization in DDS. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
