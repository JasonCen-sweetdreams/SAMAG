In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is a crucial problem that involves forming teams of agents to achieve a common goal. However, real-world scenarios often involve uncertain preferences among agents, leading to suboptimal coalitions. This paper proposes a novel distributed coalition formation algorithm, 'Uncertainty-Aware Coalition Formation' (UACF), which leverages probabilistic graphical models to capture uncertain preferences. UACF incorporates a novel uncertainty-aware reward function and a distributed optimization framework to facilitate the formation of robust coalitions. Experimental results on a simulated multi-robot scenario demonstrate that UACF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of coalition quality and adaptability to uncertain preferences.
