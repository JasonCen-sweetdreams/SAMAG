Cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have become increasingly popular due to their scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. However, optimizing queries for multi-tenant DBaaS platforms poses significant challenges. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'QTune', which leverages machine learning-based workload characterization and dynamic resource allocation to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. Our experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform show that QTune outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 3.5x in terms of query performance and 2.2x in terms of system utilization.
