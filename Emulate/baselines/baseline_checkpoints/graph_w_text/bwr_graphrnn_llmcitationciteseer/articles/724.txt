As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, creating engaging and intuitive interfaces is crucial. This study explores the effect of incorporating animated transitions on user engagement in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR interface featuring either static or animated transitions between tasks. Our results show that animated transitions significantly enhance user engagement, reducing task completion time and increasing overall satisfaction. We also identify key animation characteristics that influence user behavior, providing guidelines for VR interface designers.
