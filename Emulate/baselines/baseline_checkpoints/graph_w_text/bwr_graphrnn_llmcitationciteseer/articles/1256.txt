RDF graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large amounts of semantic data. However, query optimization remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of RDF data models and the vast number of possible query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query performance. Our experiments on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and memory usage compared to traditional optimization techniques.
