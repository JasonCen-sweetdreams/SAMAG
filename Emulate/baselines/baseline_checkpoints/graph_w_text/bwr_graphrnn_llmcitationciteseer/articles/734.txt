E-commerce search engines rely on query expansion to retrieve relevant products, but traditional methods are limited by their reliance on handcrafted rules and shallow semantic analysis. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages neural networks to learn semantic relationships between queries and products. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weights term importance based on query context and product attributes. Experiments on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 23% increase in retrieval accuracy and a 15% decrease in latency.
