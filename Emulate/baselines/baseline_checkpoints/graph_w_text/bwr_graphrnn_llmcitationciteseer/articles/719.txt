Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) is a popular technique for ensuring transactional consistency in distributed databases. However, query optimization in MVCC systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MVCOpt', which leverages a combination of static and dynamic analysis to identify optimal query execution plans. MVCOpt incorporates a probabilistic model of transaction conflicts and adapts to changing workload patterns to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. Experimental evaluation on a distributed database prototype demonstrates that MVCOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of average query response time.
