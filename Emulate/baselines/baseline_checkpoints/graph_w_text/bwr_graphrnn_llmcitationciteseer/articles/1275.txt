Query expansion is a crucial step in Information Retrieval (IR) systems to improve the retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion method using deep reinforcement learning. Our approach, called QERL, formulates query expansion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilizes a deep Q-network to learn the optimal expansion strategy. The agent learns to select the most informative terms to add to the original query by interacting with the IR system and receiving rewards based on the retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QERL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, including RM3 and Relevance Models.
