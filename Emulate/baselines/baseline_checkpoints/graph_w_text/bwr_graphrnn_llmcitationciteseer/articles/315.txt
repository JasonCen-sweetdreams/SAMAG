Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query formulations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'CAQE', which leverages context-aware neural embeddings to enrich query representations. By incorporating both semantic and syntactic features, CAQE generates more informative and diverse query expansions, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of CAQE, particularly in scenarios with ambiguous or under-specified queries.
