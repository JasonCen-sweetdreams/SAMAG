In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. Our approach enables agents to learn an optimal task assignment policy in a distributed manner, without requiring a centralized controller or explicit communication between agents. We introduce a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning architecture that incorporates both local and global reward functions, allowing agents to adapt to changing task demands and system dynamics. Experimental results on a simulated multi-robot system demonstrate significant improvements in task completion efficiency and system robustness compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
