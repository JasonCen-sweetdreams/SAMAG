Distributed temporal databases (DTDBs) are increasingly used in various applications, including financial analytics and IoT monitoring. However, query optimization in DTDBs remains a challenging task due to the complexities of temporal data and distributed processing. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'Tempo', which leverages a combination of temporal indexing, partitioning, and parallel processing to minimize query latency. Our experiments on a real-world financial dataset demonstrate that Tempo outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time while maintaining comparable accuracy.
