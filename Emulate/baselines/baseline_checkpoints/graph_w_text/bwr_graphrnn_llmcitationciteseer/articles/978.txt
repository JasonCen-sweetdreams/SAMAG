This paper presents a systematic approach to designing gamified interfaces for enhancing user engagement in virtual reality (VR) environments. We introduce a novel framework, 'VR-GAME', which integrates game design elements, such as rewards, challenges, and social sharing, with VR-specific features like spatial awareness and gesture recognition. Our user study with 30 participants shows that VR-GAME significantly increases user engagement, retention, and overall experience satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. We also provide design recommendations for developers to create more immersive and engaging VR experiences.
