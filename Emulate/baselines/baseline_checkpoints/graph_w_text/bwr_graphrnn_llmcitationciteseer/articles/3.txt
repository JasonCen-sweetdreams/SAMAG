Distributed database systems (DDBS) are critical for modern applications, but data replication strategies significantly impact their performance. This paper presents a novel replication strategy, 'ReplicaFlow', which leverages graph-based modeling to optimize data placement and reduce network latency. We develop an efficient algorithm to identify optimal replica locations and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations on real-world workloads. Results show that ReplicaFlow outperforms existing strategies by up to 35% in terms of average response time and 25% in terms of overall throughput.
