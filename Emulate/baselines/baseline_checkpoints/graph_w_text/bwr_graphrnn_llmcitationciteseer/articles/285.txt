Distributed databases have become ubiquitous in modern data processing, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel adaptive indexing approach, 'DynIndex', which dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distribution. DynIndex combines machine learning-based query prediction with cost-based optimization to minimize query latency. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database shows that DynIndex achieves up to 3x query performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques, while reducing storage overhead by up to 25%
