Large-scale graph databases have become increasingly popular in various domains, such as social networks, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs. However, efficient storage and query optimization for these databases remain significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel graph storage scheme, 'GraphZip', which leverages graph partitioning and compression techniques to reduce storage overhead. We also develop a query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', that utilizes graph structural properties to prune unnecessary query patterns and accelerate query execution. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves significant storage savings and query performance improvements compared to existing graph database systems.
