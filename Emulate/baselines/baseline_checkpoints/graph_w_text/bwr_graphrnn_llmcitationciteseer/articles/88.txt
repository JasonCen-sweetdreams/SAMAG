Ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) is a fundamental task in search engines, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion (QE) is a widely used technique to improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel QE approach based on deep neural ranking models (NRM), which leverages the semantic relationships between words to generate effective expansion terms. Our method, called NRM-QE, uses a siamese neural network to learn a similarity function between the query and candidate expansion terms. Experimental results on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate that NRM-QE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
