Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications. However, query optimization for DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query plans and the need to balance performance and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We design a DRL framework that learns to optimize query plans for DDS by interacting with a simulated environment. Our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques in terms of query latency and resource utilization on a real-world dataset.
