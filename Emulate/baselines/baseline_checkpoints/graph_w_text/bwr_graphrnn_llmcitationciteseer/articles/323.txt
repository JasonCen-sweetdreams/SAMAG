Conversational agents have the potential to support older adults with cognitive impairments, but their design often neglects the unique needs of this population. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to creating accessible conversational agents for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel conversation framework that incorporates simplification, redundancy, and error tolerance to support users with cognitive impairments. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving interaction experiences and reducing frustration.
