In multi-agent systems, trust management is crucial for facilitating cooperation and preventing malicious behavior. This paper presents a decentralized trust management framework that leverages blockchain technology to establish a tamper-proof reputation mechanism. Our approach enables agents to maintain a transparent and immutable record of their interactions, allowing them to assess the trustworthiness of their peers. We evaluate our framework using a simulated multi-agent environment and demonstrate its effectiveness in promoting cooperation and penalizing malicious behavior.
