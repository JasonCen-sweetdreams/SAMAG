Time-series data clustering is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, traditional clustering algorithms struggle with large-scale datasets and correlated time-series features. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering framework, 'NeuroClust', which leverages neural embeddings to capture complex patterns in time-series data. We introduce a multi-resolution clustering approach that iteratively refines cluster assignments using learned representations from a self-supervised neural network. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroClust outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency.
