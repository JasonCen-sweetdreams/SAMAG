Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems to improve search results. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'DeepRank', which leverages deep neural networks to learn contextualized representations of documents and queries. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both local and global semantic relationships between query terms and document content. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset show that DeepRank outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of mean average precision and NDCG@10.
