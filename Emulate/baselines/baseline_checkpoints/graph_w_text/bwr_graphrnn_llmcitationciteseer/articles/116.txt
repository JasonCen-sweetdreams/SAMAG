This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, where agents learn to allocate tasks autonomously using distributed reinforcement learning. We propose a actor-critic architecture that enables agents to learn from their local observations and communicate with neighboring agents to coordinate task assignments. Our approach outperforms traditional centralized task allocation methods in terms of adaptability, scalability, and robustness to agent failures. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in complex, dynamic environments.
