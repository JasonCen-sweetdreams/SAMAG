This paper proposes a novel framework for task allocation in multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'MARL-TA', enables agents to learn coordination strategies and allocate tasks efficiently in dynamic environments. We introduce a decentralized actor-critic architecture that combines local and global rewards to optimize task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate that MARL-TA outperforms traditional optimization methods and achieves significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization.
