Real-time anomaly detection in multimodal sensor data is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of complex systems. This paper proposes a novel approach based on explainable graph attention networks (EGATs) that can efficiently identify anomalies in high-dimensional, heterogeneous sensor data. Our EGAT model leverages the strengths of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to learn rich representations of sensor relationships and detect anomalies. We also introduce a novel explanation module that provides interpretable insights into the anomaly detection process. Experimental results on a real-world industrial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies with high accuracy and efficiency.
