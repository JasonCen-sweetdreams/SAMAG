Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in virtual reality (VR) have shown great potential for human-computer interaction. However, understanding user preferences in these environments remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel framework for eliciting user preferences through ECAs in VR. We employ a combination of natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and machine learning to analyze user interactions with ECAs. Our approach enables the identification of users' implicit preferences, which are often difficult to articulate explicitly. We evaluate our framework in a VR-based shopping scenario, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving user satisfaction and experience.
