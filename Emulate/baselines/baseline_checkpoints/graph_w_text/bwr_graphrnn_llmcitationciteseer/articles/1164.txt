Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has become a promising paradigm for open-domain question answering. However, DPR models often struggle to effectively retrieve relevant passages due to the limited query context. In this paper, we propose a neural query expansion (NQE) approach to enhance the retrieval performance of DPR models. Our NQE framework leverages a combination of semantic and syntactic features to generate expanded queries, which are then used to re-rank the retrieved passages. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the retrieval effectiveness of DPR models, especially for complex and multi-hop questions.
