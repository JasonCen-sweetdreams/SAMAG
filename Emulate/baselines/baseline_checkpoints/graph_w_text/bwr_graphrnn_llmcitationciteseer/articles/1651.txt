Information retrieval systems face the challenge of efficiently filtering out irrelevant documents from large collections. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepHashIR', which leverages deep semantic hashing to learn compact binary representations of documents. By exploiting the semantic relationships between documents, our approach reduces the dimensionality of the feature space and enables fast filtering using Hamming distance computations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepHashIR outperforms state-of-the-art filtering methods in terms of both precision and recall, while achieving significant speedups.
