Ad-hoc search systems struggle to effectively capture complex query intent, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Query Graphs (HQS), which represents queries as a hierarchical composition of entities, attributes, and relationships. We integrate HQS into a deep retrieval model, demonstrating significant improvements in ranking accuracy and robustness to query variation. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, particularly for complex, multi-entity queries.
