This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize traffic flow using autonomous agents and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We model the traffic network as a graph, where each node represents an intersection, and agents learn to optimize traffic signal control policies using a decentralized, multi-agent reinforcement learning framework. Our GCN-based model learns to capture complex traffic patterns and dependencies, outperforming traditional optimization methods in simulations. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in a real-world case study, achieving a 23% reduction in travel time and a 15% decrease in fuel consumption.
