This paper proposes a novel agent-based modeling approach for smart traffic management, which integrates context-awareness and machine learning techniques to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion. Our approach leverages real-time traffic data and sensor information to model the behavior of individual drivers, pedestrians, and vehicles as autonomous agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations of various traffic scenarios, showing significant reductions in travel time and emissions compared to traditional traffic management systems.
