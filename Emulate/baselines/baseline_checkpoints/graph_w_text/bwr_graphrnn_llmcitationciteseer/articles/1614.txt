Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis, but its application to high-dimensional data is often limited by the curse of dimensionality. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn a hierarchical representation of the data, enabling efficient clustering of high-dimensional datasets. Our method, DeepHier, uses a stacked autoencoder to learn a compact and hierarchical embedding of the data, which is then used for clustering. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepHier outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and scalability, while providing interpretable clustering results.
