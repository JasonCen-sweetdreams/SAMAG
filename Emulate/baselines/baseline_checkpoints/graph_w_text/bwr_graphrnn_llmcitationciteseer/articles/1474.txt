Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, existing methods often struggle with high-dimensional data and varying anomaly scales. We propose a novel approach, 'MSCAE', which leverages multi-scale convolutional autoencoders to learn hierarchical representations of time series data. Our method can effectively identify anomalies at different scales and reduce false positives. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of MSCAE over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
