Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various node classification tasks. However, most existing GNNs suffer from limited interpretability, making it challenging to understand the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to disentangle node representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on several benchmark datasets, showing improved performance and interpretability compared to existing GNNs. Our approach enables the identification of influential nodes and edges, facilitating the understanding of node classification decisions.
