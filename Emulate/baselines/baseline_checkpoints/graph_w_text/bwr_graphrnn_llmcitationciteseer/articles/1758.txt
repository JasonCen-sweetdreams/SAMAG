Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages adaptive contextualized word embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our approach dynamically updates the word embeddings based on the query context, allowing for more effective expansion of the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in retrieval precision and recall.
