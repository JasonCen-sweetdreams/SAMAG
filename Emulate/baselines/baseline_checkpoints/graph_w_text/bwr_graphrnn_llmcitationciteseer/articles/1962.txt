Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has seen significant progress with the advent of neural retrievers. However, existing methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper presents HierGraph, a novel hierarchical graph neural network architecture for efficient passage retrieval in ODQA. HierGraph leverages a graph-based representation of the document collection, enabling the model to capture complex contextual relationships between passages. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HierGraph achieves state-of-the-art results while reducing inference time by up to 70% compared to existing methods.
