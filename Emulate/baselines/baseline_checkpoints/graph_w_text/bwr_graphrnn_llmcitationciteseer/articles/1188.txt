Node classification on graph-structured data is a fundamental problem in many applications, but it often suffers from limited labeled data. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages the hierarchical structure of graphs to improve few-shot node classification. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and graphs at different scales, and a meta-learning framework to adapt to new graph tasks with few labeled nodes. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, especially when the labeled data is extremely scarce.
