Query expansion is a crucial technique in ad-hoc search to enhance retrieval effectiveness. However, existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering or expensive computational resources. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural network retrieval (HNRR) framework that learns to expand queries in a hierarchical manner, capturing both local and global semantic relationships between terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNRR outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and reciprocal rank while reducing computational overhead.
