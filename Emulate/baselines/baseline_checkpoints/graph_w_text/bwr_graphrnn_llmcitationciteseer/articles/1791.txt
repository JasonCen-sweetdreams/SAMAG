Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their lack of emotional intelligence can lead to user frustration and dissatisfaction. This paper presents an affective computing framework, 'EmpaVA', designed to endow voice assistants with emotional intelligence. Our approach combines natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and machine learning to enable voice assistants to recognize and respond empathetically to users' emotional states. We evaluated EmpaVA in a user study, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction, trust, and overall experience. Our findings have implications for the design of more empathetic and human-centered voice assistants.
