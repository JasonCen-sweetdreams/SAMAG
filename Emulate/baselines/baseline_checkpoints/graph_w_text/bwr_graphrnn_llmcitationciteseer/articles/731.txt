Distributed column-stores have become increasingly popular for big data analytics, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RL-QO', that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed column-stores. RL-QO uses a deep Q-network to learn a query optimization policy that adapts to the underlying data distribution and system configuration. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-QO outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
