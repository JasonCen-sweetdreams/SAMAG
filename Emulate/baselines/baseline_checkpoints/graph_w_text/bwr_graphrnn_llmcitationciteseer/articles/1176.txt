Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but its adoption is hindered by limited accessibility features for users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing adaptive UI components in VR, which dynamically adjust to individual users' needs and abilities. We propose a multi-modal interaction model that incorporates machine learning-based user profiling, gesture recognition, and real-time feedback mechanisms. Our user study with participants with varying abilities demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces.
