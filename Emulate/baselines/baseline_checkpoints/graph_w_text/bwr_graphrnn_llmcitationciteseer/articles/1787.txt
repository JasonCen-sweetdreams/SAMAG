Anomaly detection in high-dimensional data streams is a crucial task in various applications, including cybersecurity, finance, and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel deep ensemble learning framework, 'DeepENS', which combines the strengths of multiple deep learning models to detect anomalies in real-time data streams. Our approach leverages the concept of ensemble diversity to improve robustness and adaptability to concept drift. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepENS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and speed.
