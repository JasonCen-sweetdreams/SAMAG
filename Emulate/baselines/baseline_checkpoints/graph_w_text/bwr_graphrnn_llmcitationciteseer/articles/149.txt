The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an increasing need for efficient resource allocation in IoT networks. This paper proposes a decentralized agent-based approach for resource allocation, where each device is represented by an autonomous agent that negotiates with other agents to allocate resources. We introduce a novel negotiation protocol, called 'ARA', which leverages game-theoretic principles to achieve fair and efficient resource allocation. Our experimental results demonstrate that ARA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of resource utilization and network latency, while also providing robustness against node failures and malicious agents.
