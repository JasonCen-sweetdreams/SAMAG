The proliferation of fake news on social media has severe consequences for individuals and society. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) framework for explainable fake news detection. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between news articles, users, and their engagement patterns. We incorporate multi-hop attention to identify influential nodes and iteratively refine the attention weights. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that our HGNN model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and interpretability, providing actionable insights for mitigating the spread of fake news.
