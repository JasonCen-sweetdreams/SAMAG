Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their usability for individuals with dyslexia remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the challenges faced by dyslexic users when interacting with voice assistants. We identify three key areas of difficulty: linguistic complexity, auditory processing, and visual feedback. Based on our findings, we propose a set of design guidelines for creating more accessible conversational interfaces, including the use of simplified language, visual cueing, and adaptive feedback mechanisms. A prototype system incorporating these guidelines is evaluated, showing significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates for participants with dyslexia.
