Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face scalability challenges as the volume of indexed data grows exponentially. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize query processing in DIR systems by segmenting queries into a hierarchical structure. Our method, called HierSeg, leverages query clustering and segment ranking to reduce the number of nodes involved in query processing, thereby improving retrieval efficiency. Experimental results on a large-scale text dataset demonstrate that HierSeg achieves significant reductions in query latency and communication overhead compared to traditional query processing techniques.
