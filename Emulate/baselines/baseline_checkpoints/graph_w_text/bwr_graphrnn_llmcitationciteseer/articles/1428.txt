E-commerce search engines face the challenge of accurately retrieving relevant products from massive catalogs. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach that incorporates product category, user search history, and query intent analysis to disambiguate user queries. Our approach leverages a neural network-based query representation model to capture semantic relationships between query terms and product attributes. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and efficiency compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
