This paper presents a novel, gesture-based interface designed to support elderly adults with cognitive impairments. Our approach leverages a participatory design methodology, involving co-creation sessions with caregivers and individuals with dementia. We develop a gesture recognition system that is adaptable to varying levels of cognitive ability, incorporating machine learning-based error correction and personalized feedback mechanisms. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in interface usability and user satisfaction compared to traditional touch-based interfaces.
