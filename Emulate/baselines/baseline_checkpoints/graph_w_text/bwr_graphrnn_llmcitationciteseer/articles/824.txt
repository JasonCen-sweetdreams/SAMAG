Ad-hoc search often relies on query expansion techniques to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep neural retrieval networks to learn robust query representations. Our method, called 'NeuralQE', integrates a transformer-based encoder with a relevance-based feedback mechanism to generate high-quality expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuralQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
