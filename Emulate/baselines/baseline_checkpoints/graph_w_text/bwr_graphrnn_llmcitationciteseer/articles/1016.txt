Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. Despite advances in deep learning, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) for time-series anomaly detection. HGAN leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between variables and hierarchical representations to capture multi-scale patterns. We evaluate HGAN on several benchmarks and demonstrate its superior performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
