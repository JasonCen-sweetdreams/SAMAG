Neural retrieval models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc search tasks. However, their effectiveness is often limited by the quality of the input query. Query expansion techniques aim to enrich the original query by incorporating relevant terms, but their impact on neural retrieval models remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of various query expansion methods on multiple neural retrieval architectures. Our experiments reveal that judiciously applied query expansion can lead to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries with limited context. We provide insights into the factors influencing the effectiveness of query expansion and discuss implications for future research.
