In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a hierarchical task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in dynamic environments. We introduce a novel hierarchical architecture that combines a high-level task allocator with low-level agent controllers, allowing agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Experimental results using a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing agent idle time.
