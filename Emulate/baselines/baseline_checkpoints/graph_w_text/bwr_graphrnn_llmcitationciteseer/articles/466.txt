Real-time traffic flow optimization is a complex problem that requires efficient decision-making and adaptability. This paper proposes a hybrid agent-based framework that integrates machine learning and multi-agent systems to optimize traffic signal control. Our approach leverages real-time traffic data and agent-based modeling to learn traffic patterns and make decentralized decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in a simulated urban traffic network, achieving a 23% reduction in travel time and 18% decrease in congestion compared to traditional signal control methods.
