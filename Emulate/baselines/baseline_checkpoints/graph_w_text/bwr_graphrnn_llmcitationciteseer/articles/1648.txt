Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely heavily on query expansion techniques to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel neural query graph (NQG) approach for efficient query expansion. NQGs learn to represent queries as graph structures, capturing semantic relationships between query terms and their contextual dependencies. Our method uses a graph-based attention mechanism to identify the most informative expansion terms, leading to significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NQGs in terms of precision, recall, and efficiency, outperforming traditional query expansion methods.
