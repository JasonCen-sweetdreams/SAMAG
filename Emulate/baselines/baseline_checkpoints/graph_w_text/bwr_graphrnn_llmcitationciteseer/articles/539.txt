Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc information retrieval, as it significantly impacts the retrieval performance. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and statistical models, which often fall short in capturing complex semantic relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'DeepQE', which learns to expand queries by modeling the semantic interactions between words in the query and the document collection. Our experiments on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
