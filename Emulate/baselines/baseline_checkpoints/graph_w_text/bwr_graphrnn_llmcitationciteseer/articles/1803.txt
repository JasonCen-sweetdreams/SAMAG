The sheer volume of web data necessitates efficient retrieval mechanisms in modern search engines. This paper presents a novel adaptive re-ranking framework, 'ARIA', which leverages contextual information and user behavior to optimize retrieval performance. ARIA incorporates a neural ranking model that dynamically adjusts its weights based on user click-through rates and dwell times, thereby improving the ranking of relevant documents. Experimental results on a large-scale web dataset demonstrate that ARIA achieves significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain compared to state-of-the-art re-ranking methods.
