Emotion recognition is a crucial aspect of human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling systems to respond empathetically to users. This paper presents a novel multimodal approach that combines electroencephalography (EEG) and facial expression analysis to recognize emotions. Our proposed framework, 'EmoSync', uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract features from EEG signals and facial images, which are then fused using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network. We evaluate EmoSync on a dataset of 100 participants and achieve an accuracy of 92.1% in recognizing four emotions: happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. Our results demonstrate the potential of multimodal emotion recognition in enhancing HCI experiences.
