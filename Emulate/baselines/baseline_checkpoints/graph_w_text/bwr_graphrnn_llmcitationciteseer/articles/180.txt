Node classification in dynamic graphs is a challenging task due to the evolving graph structure and node attributes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that captures node representations at multiple scales. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant neighbors and time steps, enabling effective node classification in dynamic graphs. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with frequent graph updates.
