This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation in dynamic environments, leveraging self-organizing agents that adapt to changing task requirements and resource availability. Our algorithm, SOAT, uses a decentralized, gossip-based protocol to enable agents to autonomously negotiate and allocate tasks, minimizing communication overhead and maximizing system efficiency. We evaluate SOAT in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced response times compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
