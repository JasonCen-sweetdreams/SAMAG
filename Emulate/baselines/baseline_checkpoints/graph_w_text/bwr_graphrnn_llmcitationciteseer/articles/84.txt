This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent pathfinding, which combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with hierarchical planning. Our method, called Hierarchical Graph Planner (HGP), leverages the strengths of GNNs in learning node representations and the efficiency of hierarchical planning in reducing the search space. We demonstrate that HGP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality, computation time, and scalability on various benchmark scenarios. Moreover, we provide a thorough analysis of the impact of GNN architecture and hierarchical planning parameters on the performance of HGP.
