Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence, necessitating efficient query processing to support timely decision-making. This paper explores the potential of harnessing GPU acceleration to optimize join algorithms, a critical bottleneck in query processing. We propose a novel GPU-accelerated join framework, 'GPUJoin', which leverages parallel processing and memory coalescing to significantly reduce query execution times. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that GPUJoin outperforms state-of-the-art CPU-based join algorithms, achieving speedups of up to 10x for complex queries.
