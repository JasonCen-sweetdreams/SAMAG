Distributed information retrieval (IR) systems face significant scalability challenges as the volume of indexed data grows. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HIRI', that leverages a combination of tree-based and hash-based indexing techniques to accelerate query processing. HIRI adaptively partitions the index into hierarchical layers, enabling more efficient query routing and reducing the number of nodes involved in query processing. Experimental results on a large-scale IR benchmark demonstrate that HIRI achieves up to 3x improvement in query throughput and 2x reduction in average query latency compared to existing indexing methods.
