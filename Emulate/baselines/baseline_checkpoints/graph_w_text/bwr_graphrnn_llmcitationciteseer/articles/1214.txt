This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'DTRA', where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their individual capabilities and the system's global goals. DTRA utilizes a hierarchical architecture, comprising a graph neural network for task representation and a deep Q-network for action selection. We evaluate DTRA in a simulated robotic swarm scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional methods. Our approach enables efficient and adaptive task allocation in dynamic, large-scale multi-agent systems.
