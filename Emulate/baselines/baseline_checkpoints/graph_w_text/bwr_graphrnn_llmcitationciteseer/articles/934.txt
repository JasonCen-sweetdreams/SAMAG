Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck in these systems. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for scalable query optimization, which leverages the structural properties of query plans to identify optimal execution strategies. We introduce a graph neural network-based model that learns to predict query execution costs and generates optimized plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and improves system throughput by up to 2x.
