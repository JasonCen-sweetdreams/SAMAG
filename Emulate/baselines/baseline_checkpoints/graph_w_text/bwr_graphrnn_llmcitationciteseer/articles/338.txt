Distributed column stores have emerged as a popular choice for real-time analytics, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'RapidFire', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning to predict query execution times and dynamically reorders query plans to minimize latency. We propose a cost model that captures the intricacies of column-store storage and demonstrate RapidFire's efficacy on a range of real-world workloads, achieving up to 3x speedups over state-of-the-art optimizers.
