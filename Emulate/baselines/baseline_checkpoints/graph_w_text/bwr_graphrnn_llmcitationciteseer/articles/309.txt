This paper presents a novel neural ranking model for information retrieval, which leverages attention-based query embeddings to capture complex contextual relationships between queries and documents. Our proposed architecture, 'AttentiveRank', combines a deep neural network with a multi-head attention mechanism to encode queries and documents, allowing for more effective matching and scoring. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AttentiveRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving significant improvements in terms of NDCG and ERR metrics.
