Query suggestion is a crucial component of modern search engines, as it helps users formulate effective queries. Traditional approaches rely on static query logs, ignoring the temporal dynamics of user behavior. We propose a novel framework, TemporalGraphSuggest, which leverages session-based temporal graph embeddings to model the evolving query intent. Our approach captures short-term and long-term dependencies in user search sessions, enabling more accurate and personalized query suggestions. Experimental results on a large-scale query log dataset demonstrate significant improvements in suggestion quality and user engagement over state-of-the-art methods.
