In-memory databases have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics, but query optimization remains a significant challenge, especially in distributed settings. This paper presents 'QuickOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and graph-based models to efficiently explore the query optimization space. We propose a distributed, asynchronous optimization algorithm that adapts to changing data distributions and query workloads. Experimental results on a cluster of 16 machines show that QuickOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time, while reducing optimization overhead by 75%.
