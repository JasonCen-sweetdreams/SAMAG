The increasing availability of large-scale RDF graphs has created a need for efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents a novel parallel hashing approach for optimizing SPARQL queries on distributed RDF graphs. Our method leverages the properties of RDF data to minimize data transfer and reduce query execution time. We evaluate our approach using a real-world RDF dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing sequential hashing methods. The proposed technique is particularly useful for applications requiring fast querying of large RDF graphs, such as knowledge graphs and linked data.
