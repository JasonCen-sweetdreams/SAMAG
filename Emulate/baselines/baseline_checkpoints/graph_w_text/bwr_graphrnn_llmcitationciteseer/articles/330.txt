Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to refine the original query to better capture user intent. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to term embeddings, dubbed 'TermGraph', which leverages the semantic relationships between terms to improve query expansion. We represent the vocabulary as a graph, where terms are nodes and edges capture co-occurrence, synonymy, and hyponymy relationships. During query expansion, we perform a random walk on this graph to generate a set of expanded terms that are semantically related to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that TermGraph outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, leading to significant improvements in retrieval accuracy.
