Virtual Reality (VR) has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information. However, the lack of personalized avatars in VR environments can lead to a sense of disconnection and affect the overall user experience. This paper investigates the impact of personalized avatars on user experience in VR. We designed and implemented a VR system that generates personalized avatars based on user preferences and demographic data. Our user study involving 30 participants shows that personalized avatars significantly improve user engagement, presence, and overall satisfaction in VR environments. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems.
