Deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can significantly compromise their performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect such attacks using gradient-based methods. We develop a gradient-based anomaly detection algorithm that identifies abnormal input patterns by analyzing the gradient distribution of the network's activations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting various types of adversarial attacks, including FGSM and PGD. Our method achieves high detection accuracy and outperforms existing state-of-the-art detection techniques.
