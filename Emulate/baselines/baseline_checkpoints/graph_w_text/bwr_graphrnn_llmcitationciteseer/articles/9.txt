Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when dealing with novel classes. This paper introduces a hierarchical meta-learning framework, 'TaskAware', which leverages task-aware embeddings to adapt to new classes with limited labeled data. Our approach combines a task encoder with a novel meta-learner that generates class-specific weights for the embedding space. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TaskAware outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improved accuracy and robustness in the face of class imbalance and noisy data.
