Short text queries are common in search engines, but their brevity hinders effective query expansion. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages word embeddings and co-occurrence analysis to better capture the semantic context of short queries. We introduce a graph-based method to identify related terms and phrases, which are then weighted using a density-based clustering technique. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for queries with fewer than five terms.
