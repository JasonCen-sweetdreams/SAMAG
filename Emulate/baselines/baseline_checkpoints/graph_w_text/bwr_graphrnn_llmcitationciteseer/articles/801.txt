Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their success hinges on establishing user trust. This study investigates the effect of anthropomorphic design elements on user trust in conversational agents. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment, where 120 participants interacted with either an anthropomorphized or non-anthropomorphized chatbot. Results show that anthropomorphic design positively influences user trust, particularly among users with lower levels of technological expertise. However, we also identify potential pitfalls, such as over-reliance on anthropomorphism, which can lead to reduced trust when expectations are not met. Our findings have implications for the design of conversational interfaces that aim to establish long-term, trustworthy relationships with users.
