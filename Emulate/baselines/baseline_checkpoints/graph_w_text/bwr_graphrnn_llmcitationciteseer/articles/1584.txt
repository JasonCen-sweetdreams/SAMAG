Time series forecasting is a fundamental problem in many applications, but it is often complicated by missing values. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that effectively handles missing values and improves forecasting accuracy. Our approach leverages a hierarchical structure to capture complex patterns at multiple scales, while incorporating a attention mechanism to selectively focus on the most relevant inputs. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean absolute error and mean squared error.
