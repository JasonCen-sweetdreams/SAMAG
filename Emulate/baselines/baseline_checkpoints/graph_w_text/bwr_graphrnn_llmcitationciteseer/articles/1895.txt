Real-time data warehousing demands efficient indexing mechanisms to support rapid data ingestion and query processing. However, dynamic schema evolution in modern data sources poses significant challenges to traditional indexing approaches. This paper proposes 'DynIx', a novel indexing framework that adapts to schema changes in real-time. DynIx leverages a multi-layered indexing structure and a cost-based optimization algorithm to minimize re-indexing overhead and ensure query performance. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that DynIx outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time and data ingestion throughput.
