Time series forecasting is a crucial task in many applications, including finance, healthcare, and energy. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in this domain, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that provides explainable time series forecasting. Our approach leverages a hierarchical structure to capture long-term dependencies and attention mechanisms to identify relevant features. We evaluate our model on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to provide accurate forecasts while generating meaningful feature importance scores. Our results show that HAN outperforms existing baselines and provides valuable insights into the forecasting process.
