Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in Information Retrieval (IR). This paper presents a novel deep learning approach, 'MAR-DNN', which models multiple relevance aspects to improve ad-hoc retrieval performance. Our approach leverages a multi-task learning framework, where separate neural networks are trained to predict different relevance aspects, including topical, semantic, and contextual relevance. We demonstrate that MAR-DNN outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models on several benchmark datasets, including TREC and ClueWeb09. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the learned relevance aspects, shedding light on the strengths and limitations of our approach.
