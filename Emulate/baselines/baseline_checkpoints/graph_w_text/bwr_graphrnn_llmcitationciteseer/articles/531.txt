The proliferation of multi-modal data has created challenges for traditional indexing techniques. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the strengths of inverted indexing and hierarchical clustering. Our method, called 'HybridIndex', leverages the efficiency of inverted indexing for textual data and the effectiveness of hierarchical clustering for non-textual data. We demonstrate the efficacy of HybridIndex through extensive experiments on a large-scale dataset, showcasing significant improvements in retrieval time and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods.
