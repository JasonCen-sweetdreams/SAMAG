Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various applications, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for anomaly detection in time-series data. HGAT leverages the graph structure of time-series data to capture complex dependencies and relationships between different variables. The proposed model consists of two components: a graph attention module that learns to focus on relevant nodes and a hierarchical clustering module that identifies anomalies at multiple scales. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to noise.
