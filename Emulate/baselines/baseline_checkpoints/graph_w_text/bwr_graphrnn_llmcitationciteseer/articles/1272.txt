The proliferation of real-time data sources has underscored the need for efficient query processing in information retrieval systems. This paper presents a novel context-aware indexing technique, 'CAI', which leverages query patterns and user behavior to optimize index structures for real-time query answering. CAI incorporates a probabilistic modeling framework to capture the uncertainty of user queries and adaptively adjusts the index layout to minimize query latency. Experimental evaluation on a large-scale news dataset demonstrates that CAI reduces query response times by up to 47% compared to traditional indexing methods, while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy.
