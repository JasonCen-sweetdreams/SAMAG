Virtual assistants (VAs) are increasingly integrated into daily life, but their lack of embodiment can lead to user distrust. This study investigates the effect of anthropomorphic embodiment on user trust in VAs. We designed an experiment with 120 participants, where they interacted with a VA either with a humanoid avatar or without. Results show that participants who interacted with the embodied VA reported higher trust and perceived the VA as more intelligent and relatable. We also found that users' personality traits, such as agreeableness and conscientiousness, influenced their trust in the VA. Our findings have implications for the design of future VAs, suggesting that embodiment can be a crucial factor in establishing user trust.
