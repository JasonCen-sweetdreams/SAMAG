Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies heavily on accurate passage retrieval to identify relevant contexts. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical dense representation approach, called HierDPR, which significantly improves the efficiency and effectiveness of passage retrieval. By leveraging a hierarchical architecture and dense passage representations, HierDPR reduces the dimensionality of the search space and enables faster nearest-neighbor search. Experimental results on popular ODQA datasets demonstrate that HierDPR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both retrieval accuracy and query latency.
