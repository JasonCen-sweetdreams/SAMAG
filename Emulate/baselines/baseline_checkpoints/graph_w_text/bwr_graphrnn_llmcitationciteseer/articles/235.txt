Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent in various applications, but their accessibility for users with visual impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an accessible conversational interface, 'TalkEase', which leverages natural language processing and audio-based feedback to facilitate intuitive interaction. We conducted a series of usability studies with visually impaired participants, resulting in a set of design guidelines that improve the overall user experience. Our evaluation demonstrates that TalkEase significantly reduces errors and increases user satisfaction compared to traditional screen reader-based interfaces.
