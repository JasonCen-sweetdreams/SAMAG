Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complex and nuanced nature of patent documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep learning-based semantic embeddings to improve the retrieval performance. We employ a pre-trained language model to generate semantic embeddings for patent documents and then use these embeddings to expand the initial query. Our experiments on a large patent dataset show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision.
