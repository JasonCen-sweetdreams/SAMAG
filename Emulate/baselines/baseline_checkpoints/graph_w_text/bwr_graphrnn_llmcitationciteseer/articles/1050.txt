Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, including education, entertainment, and healthcare. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge in VR systems. This paper investigates the impact of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR. We designed and implemented a VR platform that generates avatars tailored to individual users' preferences and personality traits. Our user study involving 120 participants reveals that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, improved task performance, and enhanced overall VR experience. We also identify key factors influencing avatar personalization, including user demographics, personality, and cognitive styles.
