In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper introduces a novel decentralized approach using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to allocate tasks to agents. Our algorithm, called DecentraTA, leverages a hierarchical clustering method to group agents into clusters, reducing the problem size and enabling faster computation. We evaluate DecentraTA on a set of benchmark problems, demonstrating improved solution quality and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized task allocation algorithms.
