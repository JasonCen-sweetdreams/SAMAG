This paper addresses the problem of task allocation for heterogeneous agent teams in complex, dynamic environments. We propose a decentralized framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach enables agents to learn effective task allocation strategies in real-time, without requiring explicit communication or centralized control. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our GNN-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion efficiency and team adaptability.
