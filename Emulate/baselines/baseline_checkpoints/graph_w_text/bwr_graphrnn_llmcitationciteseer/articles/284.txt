Neural search engines have revolutionized information retrieval, but their query processing capabilities are often limited by the quality of the query representation. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'GraphQE', that leverages graph-based term dependencies to improve the retrieval of relevant documents. By modeling term co-occurrences as a graph, we identify the most informative terms and their relationships, enabling more accurate query expansion. Experimental results on the TREC benchmarks show that GraphQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
