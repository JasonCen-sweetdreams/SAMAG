Conventional information retrieval systems rely on shallow ranking models, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking framework, 'HiRank', which leverages document hierarchies to improve retrieval efficiency. HiRank employs a document-level neural network to extract semantic representations, followed by a hierarchical aggregation mechanism to capture contextual relationships. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HiRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
