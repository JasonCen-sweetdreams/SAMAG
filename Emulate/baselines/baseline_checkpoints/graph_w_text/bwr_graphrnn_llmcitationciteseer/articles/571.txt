Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it bridges the gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for query expansion, which learns to select optimal expansion terms by interacting with a simulated retrieval environment. Our approach, 'RL-Expander', employs a hierarchical policy network to balance exploration and exploitation, and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the learned expansion strategies and their correlation with retrieval performance.
