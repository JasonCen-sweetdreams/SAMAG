E-commerce search engines struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture to better understand query intent. Our approach leverages both local and global contextual features from query phrases and product descriptions, enabling the model to differentiate between ambiguous query terms. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search accuracy and relevance compared to state-of-the-art intent modeling techniques.
