Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud-based applications, but optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans based on runtime statistics and feedback from the database. Our experiments on a real-world multi-tenant database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
