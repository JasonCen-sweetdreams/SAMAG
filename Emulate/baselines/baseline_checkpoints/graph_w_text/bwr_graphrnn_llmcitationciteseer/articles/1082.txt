Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, which learns to generate context-aware expansion terms from large-scale clickthrough data. Our proposed model, 'DeepQE', leverages a combination of recurrent and convolutional neural networks to capture both sequential and semantic relationships between query terms. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods and state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
