In this paper, we propose a novel distributed task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, which integrates adaptive coalition formation with task assignment. Our approach, called ACTA, enables agents to dynamically form coalitions based on their capabilities, task requirements, and environmental factors. ACTA uses a decentralized, graph-based optimization algorithm to allocate tasks to coalitions, minimizing overall system cost and latency. We evaluate ACTA through extensive simulations, demonstrating its superiority over existing task allocation methods in terms of system performance, adaptability, and robustness to agent failures.
