Time series forecasting is a crucial task in many applications, but existing methods often neglect uncertainty estimation. This paper introduces Hierarchical Gaussian Process Regression (HGPR), a novel Bayesian approach that models complex temporal dependencies and provides uncertainty quantification. HGPR leverages a hierarchical structure to jointly learn local and global patterns, enabling accurate predictions and uncertainty estimation. We evaluate HGPR on several real-world datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive performance and uncertainty calibration.
