Traditional document representation methods in information retrieval (IR) systems often neglect the complex relationships between entities and concepts. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention (HGA) framework, which models documents as hierarchical graphs to capture both local and global semantic dependencies. Our approach learns to recursively aggregate node representations using attention mechanisms, enabling more accurate retrieval of relevant documents. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, especially for complex queries.
