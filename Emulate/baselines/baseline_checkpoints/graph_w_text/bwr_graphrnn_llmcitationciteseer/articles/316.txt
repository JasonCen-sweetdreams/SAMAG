The proliferation of large-scale information systems has led to an exponential increase in document collections, making efficient retrieval a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to document retrieval, leveraging hierarchical document embeddings to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. We introduce a neural network-based model that learns to project documents into a hierarchical space, enabling the pruning of irrelevant documents at early stages of the retrieval process. Experimental results on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.
