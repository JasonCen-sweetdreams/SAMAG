Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it can significantly impact the quality of retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'RL-EXPAND', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the expansion process. RL-EXPAND learns to select the most informative terms to add to the original query, taking into account the diversity of the retrieved documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-EXPAND outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving higher recall and precision while maintaining computational efficiency.
