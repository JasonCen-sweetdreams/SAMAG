Distributed database systems face significant challenges in balancing query performance and data consistency. This paper presents an adaptive replication strategy, 'AWARE', that dynamically adjusts data replication based on workload patterns and query distributions. AWARE leverages machine learning models to predict query hotspots and proactively replicates data to reduce latency and improve throughput. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database system demonstrates that AWARE achieves up to 35% improvement in query performance and 25% reduction in replication overhead compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
