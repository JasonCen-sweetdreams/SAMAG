Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown remarkable success in various applications, but its vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises concerns about its reliability. This paper proposes a novel transfer learning-based approach to enhance the robustness of DRL against adversarial attacks. We demonstrate that by transferring knowledge from a pre-trained policy to a target policy, we can significantly improve the robustness of the target policy against a range of attacks. Our experiments on popular DRL benchmarks show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of robustness and convergence rate.
