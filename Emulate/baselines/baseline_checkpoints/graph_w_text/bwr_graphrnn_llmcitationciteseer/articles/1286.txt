Public displays are increasingly prevalent, but their security remains a concern. This paper proposes an implicit authentication mechanism that leverages eye-gaze patterns to verify user identity. Our approach, 'GazeAuth', uses a deep learning model to analyze eye movements and detect anomalies indicative of unauthorized access. We evaluate GazeAuth on a dataset of 50 participants, achieving an accuracy of 93.2% and a false acceptance rate of 1.5%. The results demonstrate the feasibility of eye-gaze-based implicit authentication for public displays, offering a convenient and secure alternative to traditional authentication methods.
