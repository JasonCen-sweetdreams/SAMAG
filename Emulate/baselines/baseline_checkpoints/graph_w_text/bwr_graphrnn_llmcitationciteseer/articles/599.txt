Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its accessibility for users with disabilities remains a significant concern. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We propose a set of guidelines for VR developers, incorporating insights from accessibility experts, user studies, and cognitive psychology. Our evaluation of three VR applications demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework in improving user experience and reducing barriers for users with disabilities.
