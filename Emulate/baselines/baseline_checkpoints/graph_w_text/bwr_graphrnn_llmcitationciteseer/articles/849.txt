Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in information retrieval (IR) systems, aiming to improve retrieval effectiveness by incorporating relevant terms into the original query. This paper presents a novel QE approach, termed ACTE (Adaptive Context-aware Term Embeddings), which leverages the power of deep learning and contextualized term representations. ACTE adaptively updates term embeddings based on the query context, effectively capturing nuanced semantic relationships between terms. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACTE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, particularly in scenarios with ambiguous or polysemous queries.
