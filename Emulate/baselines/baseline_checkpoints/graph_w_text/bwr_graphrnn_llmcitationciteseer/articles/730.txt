Entity disambiguation in knowledge graphs is crucial for various applications, including question answering and text analysis. However, existing approaches struggle to scale to massive graphs. We propose a novel graph-aware representation learning framework, 'GraphED', which jointly models entity and relation representations in a unified graph neural network. GraphED leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant graph neighborhoods, enabling efficient disambiguation of entities with similar names. Experiments on large-scale knowledge graphs demonstrate that GraphED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
