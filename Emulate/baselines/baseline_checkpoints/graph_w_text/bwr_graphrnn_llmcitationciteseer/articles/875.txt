Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, aiming to refine the user's original query to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between words and phrases. Our model utilizes a combination of word embeddings and convolutional neural networks to identify relevant expansion terms, and we demonstrate its superiority over traditional methods on several benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that DeepQE achieves significant improvements in mean average precision and recall, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
