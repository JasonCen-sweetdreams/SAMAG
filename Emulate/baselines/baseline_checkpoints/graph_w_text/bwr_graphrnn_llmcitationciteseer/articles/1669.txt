As data warehousing applications continue to grow in complexity, query optimization remains a critical performance bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'FlexiCube', which combines the benefits of traditional B-tree indexing with the scalability of bitmap indexing. We develop a cost-based optimization framework that dynamically selects the most effective indexing strategy based on query workload characteristics and data distribution. Experimental evaluations on a real-world dataset demonstrate that FlexiCube achieves up to 3.5x speedup in query execution time compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
