As the volume of data grows, efficient information retrieval (IR) systems are crucial for various applications. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph indexing technique, 'HierG', designed to accelerate query processing in large-scale IR systems. HierG leverages graph-based indexing to prune the search space, reducing the number of candidate documents and improving query response times. We evaluate HierG on the TREC Web Track dataset and demonstrate significant performance gains compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving an average query speedup of 3.2x.
