Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant text segments containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages both syntactic and semantic relationships between query terms to generate an expanded query representation. Our HQE method combines phrase-level expansion with entity-based expansion, enabling more effective passage ranking and reducing the number of retrieved passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods, achieving a 15% improvement in top-1 accuracy while reducing the average number of retrieved passages by 30%.
