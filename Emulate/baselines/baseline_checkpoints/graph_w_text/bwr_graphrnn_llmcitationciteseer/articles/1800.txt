Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. We conducted a comprehensive user study to identify the key challenges and requirements for accessible VR interactions. Based on our findings, we developed a set of guidelines and a prototype system that leverages 3D audio, haptic feedback, and voice commands to provide an immersive and interactive VR experience. Our evaluation results show that our approach significantly improves the usability and enjoyment of VR for visually impaired users.
