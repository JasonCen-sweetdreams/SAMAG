Search engines often struggle to provide diverse results, leading to user dissatisfaction. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhancing search result diversity using hierarchical clustering and reinforcement learning. We introduce a clustering algorithm that groups similar documents into hierarchies, allowing for more nuanced representations of document similarity. A reinforcement learning framework is then used to optimize the ranking function, encouraging the selection of diverse and relevant documents. Experiments on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate significant improvements in search result diversity and user satisfaction.
