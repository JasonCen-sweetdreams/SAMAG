Virtual assistants have become ubiquitous, but their lack of emotional intelligence can lead to frustration and abandonment, particularly among people with disabilities. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EmpaCare', a novel virtual assistant that incorporates emotional awareness and empathetic responses. We conducted a user study with 30 participants with disabilities, demonstrating that EmpaCare significantly improved user satisfaction and engagement compared to traditional virtual assistants. Our findings highlight the importance of emotional intelligence in human-computer interaction and pave the way for more inclusive and supportive virtual assistants.
