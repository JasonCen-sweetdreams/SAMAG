Distributed information retrieval systems (DIRS) are crucial for large-scale search engines, but processing complex queries remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an adaptive re-ranking framework that leverages query log analysis and machine learning to optimize query processing in DIRS. Our approach dynamically adjusts the ranking model based on query patterns, reducing the need for expensive re-execution and improving overall system efficiency. Experimental results on a large-scale query dataset demonstrate significant reductions in processing time and improved result quality compared to existing re-ranking methods.
