The rapid growth of big data has led to the widespread adoption of NoSQL databases, which often compromise on query performance to achieve high scalability. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing scheme, termed HIndex, which combines the strengths of log-structured merge-trees and B+ trees to optimize query performance in NoSQL databases. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that HIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing schemes by up to 30% in terms of query latency, while maintaining comparable storage efficiency.
