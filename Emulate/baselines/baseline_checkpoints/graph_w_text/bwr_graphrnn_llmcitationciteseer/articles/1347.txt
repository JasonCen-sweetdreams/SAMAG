This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to be assigned to tasks to maximize overall system efficiency. We propose a decentralized auction-based mechanism, called 'TaskAuction', which allows agents to bid on tasks based on their private valuations. TaskAuction incorporates a novel pricing scheme that incentivizes agents to reveal their true valuations, and a task allocation algorithm that maximizes social welfare. Experimental results on a simulated multi-agent system demonstrate that TaskAuction outperforms existing centralized allocation methods in terms of system efficiency and fairness.
