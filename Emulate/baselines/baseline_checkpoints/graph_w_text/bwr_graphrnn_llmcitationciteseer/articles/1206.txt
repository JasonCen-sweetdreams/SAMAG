As main-memory databases continue to gain popularity, query optimization techniques must adapt to their unique characteristics. This paper focuses on multidimensional range queries, which are critical in various applications such as spatial databases and data analytics. We propose a novel query optimization algorithm, 'Ranger', that leverages the properties of main-memory storage to reduce query latency. Ranger employs a combination of indexing, caching, and parallel processing to minimize the number of memory accesses and improve query performance. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Ranger outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x for complex range queries.
