Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in node classification tasks. However, they often struggle to generalize to unseen graphs or nodes. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages graph structural information and node features to improve inductive node classification. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs, enabling more accurate predictions on unseen nodes. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in inductive node classification tasks, achieving improved accuracy and robustness.
