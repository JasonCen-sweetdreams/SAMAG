Temporal graph databases have become increasingly important for real-time analytics in various domains. However, existing indexing techniques for temporal graphs are either inefficient or ineffective for handling large-scale dynamic graphs. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, called Temporal Graph Index (TGI), which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, temporal segmentation, and incremental indexing. Our experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that TGI outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 5x in terms of query performance and 3x in terms of indexing time.
