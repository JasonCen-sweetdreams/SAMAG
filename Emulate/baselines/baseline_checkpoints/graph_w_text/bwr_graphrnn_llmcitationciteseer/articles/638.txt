Data warehousing has become a crucial component of business intelligence, enabling organizations to make informed decisions based on historical and real-time data. However, the sheer volume and velocity of modern data streams pose significant challenges to indexing and query performance. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, 'RT-Index', which leverages a combination of in-memory caching, column-store indexing, and adaptive sampling to optimize query response times for real-time data warehousing. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that RT-Index outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of data freshness.
