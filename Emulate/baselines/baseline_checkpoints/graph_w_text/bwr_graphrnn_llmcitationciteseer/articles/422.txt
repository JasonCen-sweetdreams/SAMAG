Traditional information retrieval systems rely on lexical matching and tf-idf based ranking, which often fail to capture semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'SemRank', that leverages pre-trained language models to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. We introduce a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes ranking, classification, and clustering objectives to improve retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and relevance.
