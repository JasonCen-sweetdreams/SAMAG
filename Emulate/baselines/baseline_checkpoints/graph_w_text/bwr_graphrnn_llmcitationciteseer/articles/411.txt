Task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems (MAS), where agents with different capabilities need to be assigned to tasks to optimize system performance. This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We propose a hierarchical DRL framework that learns to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, task requirements, and system constraints. Our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system adaptability to changes in task requirements or agent availability. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in complex, heterogeneous MAS.
