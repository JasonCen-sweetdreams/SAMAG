Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities and preferences need to be assigned to tasks to optimize system performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task allocation framework that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model agent-task interactions. Our approach represents the agents and tasks as nodes in a graph, and uses GCNs to learn a hierarchical representation of the task allocation problem. Experimental results on a simulated robot swarm scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency.
