Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare interfaces, but their design often neglects the needs of diverse user populations. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive ECAs that can effectively communicate with patients from varying cultural, linguistic, and ability backgrounds. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants, which informed the development of a set of design guidelines for ECAs that promote empathy, trust, and understanding in healthcare interactions. Our evaluation shows that ECAs designed using our framework can significantly improve patient engagement and satisfaction, particularly for underserved populations.
