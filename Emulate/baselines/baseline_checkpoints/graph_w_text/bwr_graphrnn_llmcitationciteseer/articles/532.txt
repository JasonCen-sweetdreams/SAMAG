As the volume of digital data continues to grow, distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems have become essential for efficient querying. However, the communication overhead and data redundancy in these systems can lead to significant latency and resource waste. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach, 'DirClust', which organizes peer nodes into a hierarchical structure based on their data similarity and query patterns. Our experiments on a large-scale DIR system show that DirClust reduces the average query response time by 35% and improves the system's scalability by 28% compared to traditional flooding-based query routing strategies.
