Distributed database systems require efficient data partitioning to minimize data transfer and improve query performance. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach for scalable data partitioning, exploiting the underlying structure of the data. We introduce a hierarchical graph partitioning algorithm that adapts to the database schema and query patterns, achieving significant improvements in data locality and query response times. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing data transfer and improving system scalability.
