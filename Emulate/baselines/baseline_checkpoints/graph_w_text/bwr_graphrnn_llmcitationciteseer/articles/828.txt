As autonomous vehicles (AVs) become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their decision-making processes are transparent and explainable is crucial for safety and trust. This paper presents a novel model-agnostic explainability framework, 'AVEX', designed for real-time decision-making in AVs. AVEX leverages a combination of attention-based feature importance and counterfactual analysis to provide interpretable explanations for the vehicle's actions. Our experiments on a large-scale AV dataset demonstrate that AVEX can provide accurate explanations within milliseconds, making it suitable for real-time deployment. We also show that AVEX can improve driver trust and understanding of AV decision-making through user studies.
