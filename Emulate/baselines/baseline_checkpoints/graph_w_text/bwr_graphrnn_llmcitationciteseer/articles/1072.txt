Neural retrieval models have shown impressive performance in information retrieval tasks, but their effectiveness relies on the quality of the query representation. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to adaptively refine the query representation. Our method, dubbed 'NeuroExp', iteratively generates synthetic relevance labels and uses them to update the query representation, leading to significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experimental results on a range of benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuroExp in improving the retrieval quality, especially for queries with limited relevance feedback.
