Traditional learning-to-rank methods in information retrieval (IR) often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HNR, which leverages a tree-based architecture to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. HNR learns to aggregate local ranking signals from sibling nodes, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of top-ranked documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNR outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models while reducing computational overhead by up to 40%
