Conversational AI systems struggle to accurately track dialogue state across multiple domains. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Dialogue State Tracking (HADST) model that incorporates domain-specific and global attention mechanisms. Our approach exploits the hierarchical structure of dialogue state to selectively focus on relevant context and domain knowledge. Experimental results on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in joint goal accuracy and dialogue success rate compared to state-of-the-art models, showcasing the potential of HADST for real-world conversational AI applications.
