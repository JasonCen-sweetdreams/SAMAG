Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but limitations in haptic feedback hinder immersion and user experience. This study explores the effects of different haptic feedback modalities on user perception, engagement, and task performance in VR. We designed a VR environment with varying levels of haptic feedback, including vibration, force feedback, and thermal feedback. Our user study (N = 40) reveals that multimodal haptic feedback significantly enhances user experience, reduces cognitive load, and improves task accuracy compared to visual-only or single-modal haptic feedback. The findings have implications for the design of haptic interfaces in VR applications.
