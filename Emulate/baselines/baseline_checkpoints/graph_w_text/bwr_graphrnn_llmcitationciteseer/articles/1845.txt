Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the underlying semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. To address this, we propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to incorporate semantic knowledge into the retrieval process. Our method, dubbed 'KG-Exp', represents queries and documents as dense vectors in a shared knowledge graph space, enabling the capture of nuanced relationships between entities and concepts. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-Exp significantly improves retrieval performance, particularly for queries with ambiguous or rare terms.
