Accurate prediction of molecular properties is crucial in chemical compound design and discovery. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for molecular representation learning. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, 'HierGAT', which leverages both local and global structural information in molecules. By incorporating attention mechanisms at multiple scales, HierGAT effectively captures complex molecular interactions and significantly improves property prediction performance. Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate the superiority of HierGAT over existing state-of-the-art models in predicting molecular solubility, logP, and toxicity.
