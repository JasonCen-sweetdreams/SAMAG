This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach for ad-hoc retrieval, leveraging deep learning-based document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'EmbEx', represents documents as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, enabling the identification of relevant expansion terms through vector similarity calculations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, when compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
