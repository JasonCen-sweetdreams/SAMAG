The increasing size and complexity of RDF graphs have rendered traditional indexing techniques inefficient. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach based on hierarchical Bloom filters, which enables scalable and efficient querying of RDF data. Our approach partitions the RDF graph into smaller subgraphs and constructs a hierarchical index using Bloom filters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on real-world RDF datasets, showing improved query performance and reduced memory usage compared to existing indexing techniques.
