As robots increasingly enter industrial workplaces, effective human-robot collaboration (HRC) is crucial for productivity and safety. This paper explores the role of embodiment in HRC, examining how a robot's physical presence and gestures influence human trust, communication, and task performance. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, using a robotic arm with varying levels of embodiment. Results show that a more embodied robot leads to higher trust and better task outcomes, but also increases perceived workload. Our findings have implications for the design of HRC systems and highlight the need for careful consideration of embodiment in industrial robot design.
