Multi-agent autonomous systems (MAAS) are increasingly prevalent in real-world applications, but their complexity necessitates novel control strategies. This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework for MAAS, where each agent learns to coordinate with its peers while adapting to dynamic environments. Our HDRL architecture consists of two levels: a high-level policy network that determines agent roles and a low-level controller network that executes primitive actions. We evaluate the proposed approach on a simulated drone swarm scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and robustness to agent failures compared to flat RL baselines.
