Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component of modern data analytics. However, traditional indexing techniques often struggle to meet the performance demands of real-time query processing. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to optimize query performance. We introduce a new indexing technique, 'QuickIndex', which uses machine learning models to predict the optimal indexing strategy for a given query workload. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale real-time data warehousing system demonstrates that QuickIndex outperforms traditional indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency, while also reducing index maintenance costs by up to 50%
