Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or incomplete queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using hierarchical document embeddings. Our method, called HiDE, represents documents as a hierarchy of semantic clusters, which are then used to expand the query through a relevance-based clustering algorithm. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiDE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
