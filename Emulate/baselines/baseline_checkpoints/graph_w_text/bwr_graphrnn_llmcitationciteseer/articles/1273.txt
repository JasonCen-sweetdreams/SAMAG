As the global population ages, designing accessible interfaces for elderly users becomes increasingly important. This paper presents a study on gestural interfaces, focusing on gesture recognition and feedback mechanisms tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65-85, evaluating the effectiveness of three gesture recognition algorithms and four feedback modalities (visual, auditory, tactile, and haptic). Our results show that a machine learning-based approach outperforms traditional rule-based methods, while multimodal feedback significantly improves user performance and satisfaction. The findings inform the design of gestural interfaces that cater to the unique needs of elderly users.
