As data volumes continue to grow, distributed relational databases face significant query performance challenges. This paper presents an adaptive indexing framework for optimizing query execution in distributed relational databases. Our approach dynamically monitors query workloads and adjusts indexing strategies to minimize query latency and maximize resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our adaptive indexing technique achieves up to 30% improvement in query performance compared to traditional indexing methods.
