Traditional learning-to-rank models rely on flat document representations, ignoring the inherent hierarchical structure of documents. This paper proposes a novel graph-based ranking approach, HierRank, which leverages document graphs to capture semantic relationships between entities, sections, and sentences. By incorporating graph neural networks and a hierarchical attention mechanism, HierRank achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness on benchmark datasets. We demonstrate the scalability of our approach through experiments on large-scale document collections.
