Cloud computing platforms require efficient resource allocation to minimize costs and ensure quality of service. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to optimize resource allocation in real-time, considering dynamic workload patterns and available resources. Our proposed framework, 'CloudOpt', utilizes a novel combination of deep Q-networks and actor-critic methods to learn a policy that adapts to changing system conditions. Experimental results on a large-scale cloud simulation platform demonstrate that CloudOpt outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic-based approaches, achieving up to 25% reduction in resource wastage and 15% improvement in response time.
