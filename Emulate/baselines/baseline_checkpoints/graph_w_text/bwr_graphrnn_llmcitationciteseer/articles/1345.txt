Entity disambiguation is a critical task in knowledge graph construction, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in text. Existing approaches often rely on expensive graph-based methods or require significant computational resources. This paper presents a novel indexing scheme, 'KG-Index', that enables real-time entity disambiguation by leveraging the structural properties of knowledge graphs. We propose a hierarchical indexing framework that prunes the search space and reduces the number of candidate entities, resulting in significant speedups without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results on popular knowledge graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of KG-Index in achieving high accuracy and efficiency.
