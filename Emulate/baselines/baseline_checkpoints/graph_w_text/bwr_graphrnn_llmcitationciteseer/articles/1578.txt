Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, aims to improve retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, leveraging deep learning-based contextualized embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Our method, dubbed QE-DEEP, integrates BERT-based embeddings with a graph-based ranking model to select the most informative expansion terms. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QE-DEEP outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
