Real-time data warehousing requires efficient view maintenance to support timely decision-making. Existing incremental view maintenance techniques suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper presents a novel approach, 'IVM-Forest', which leverages a hierarchical forest of indices to expedite view maintenance. IVM-Forest adaptively reorganizes the index forest in response to data updates, ensuring that view maintenance queries are executed efficiently. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that IVM-Forest outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by up to 50% in terms of maintenance time while providing accurate query results.
