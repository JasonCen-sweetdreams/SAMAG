Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms face significant challenges in optimizing query performance for multiple tenants with diverse workloads. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to query optimization in DBaaS environments. We propose a novel RL framework, 'RL-Optimizer', which learns to optimize queries based on feedback from the database and workload characteristics. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world DBaaS platform shows that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
