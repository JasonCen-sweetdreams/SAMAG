Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with motor disabilities often face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents a novel, inclusive VR interface design framework that accommodates users with diverse motor abilities. We conducted a participatory design study with 20 participants with motor disabilities, resulting in a set of actionable guidelines for designing accessible VR interfaces. Our framework incorporates adaptive gesture recognition, personalized interaction modes, and real-time feedback mechanisms. A usability study with 30 participants demonstrates that our framework significantly improves VR interaction experiences for users with motor disabilities, enabling them to fully engage with VR applications.
