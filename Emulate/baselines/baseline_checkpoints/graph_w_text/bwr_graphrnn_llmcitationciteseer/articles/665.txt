Current document ranking models in Information Retrieval (IR) often rely on handcrafted features and shallow learning architectures. We propose a novel neural ranking model, 'Query2Rank', which leverages deep neural networks to learn query embeddings and document representations simultaneously. Our approach uses a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize ranking and relevance classification tasks. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that Query2Rank outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
