The design of neural network architectures is a time-consuming process that requires significant expertise. We propose a novel graph-based reinforcement learning approach, 'NeuroGraph', to efficiently search for optimal architectures. NeuroGraph represents neural networks as graphs and employs a reinforcement learning agent to iteratively modify the graph structure to improve the network's performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuroGraph on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing the search time by an order of magnitude compared to existing methods.
