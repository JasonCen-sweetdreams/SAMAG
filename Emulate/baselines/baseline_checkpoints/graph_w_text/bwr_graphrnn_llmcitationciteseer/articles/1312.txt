Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice-based interfaces for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel interaction framework, 'ElderVoice', which incorporates features such as personalized vocabulary adaptation, error forgiveness, and multimodal feedback. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice-based interfaces.
