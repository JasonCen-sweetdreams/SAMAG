Virtual Reality (VR) has shown immense potential in various fields, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR game using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results indicate that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, reduced cognitive load, and improved overall satisfaction. We also explore the role of avatar customization on user identity and self-presence in VR. This research has implications for the design of VR systems, particularly in applications such as education, therapy, and entertainment.
