Ad-hoc retrieval has long been a challenging task in information retrieval, and query expansion (QE) is a crucial technique to improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel QE approach that leverages deep learning-based phrase embeddings to capture semantic relationships between phrases. Our method, called Phrase2Vec, uses a neural network to learn vector representations of phrases from a large corpus, which are then used to expand the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Phrase2Vec outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
