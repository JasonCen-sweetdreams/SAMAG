Distributed search engines face significant scalability challenges when handling complex queries. This paper presents an Elastic Retrieval Model (ERM) that adaptively expands queries based on real-time document retrieval patterns. ERM leverages a probabilistic graph-based approach to identify relevant terms and phrases, which are then incorporated into the query through a feedback loop. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that ERM improves retrieval efficiency by up to 30% while maintaining query precision.
