Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to trust their predictions. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our HAN model incorporates multi-scale attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant temporal and spatial patterns, enabling the identification of anomalous subsequences. We evaluate our approach on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting anomalies while providing visual explanations for the predictions.
