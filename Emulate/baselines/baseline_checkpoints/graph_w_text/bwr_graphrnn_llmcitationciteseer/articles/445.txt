Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale datasets. However, indexing high-dimensional data in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel indexing technique,called Hierarchical Grid Index (HGI), which leverages the hierarchical structure of distributed databases to efficiently index high-dimensional data. HGI uses a combination of grid-based indexing and hierarchical clustering to reduce the number of disk accesses and improve query performance. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HGI outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query speed and storage efficiency.
