Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient retrieval of relevant passages from a massive corpus to answer user queries. This paper presents DPR-PRF, a novel dense retrieval model that integrates passage retrieval and passage re-ranking into a single, end-to-end trainable framework. We propose a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both local and global contextual information, enabling more accurate passage retrieval and re-ranking. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that DPR-PRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving a 15% improvement in top-1 passage retrieval accuracy and a 20% reduction in inference time.
