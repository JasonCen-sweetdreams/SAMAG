Recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning have revitalized interest in mid-air gesture recognition for intelligent home automation. This paper presents a novel framework, ' GestureHome', which leverages a fusion of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to recognize and interpret complex gestures in real-time. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating a significant reduction in gesture recognition errors and improved user experience compared to existing approaches. Our framework is particularly suited for applications in smart home environments, where intuitive and hands-free control is essential.
