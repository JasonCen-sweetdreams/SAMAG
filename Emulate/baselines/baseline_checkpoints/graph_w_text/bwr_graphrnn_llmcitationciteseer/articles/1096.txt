Column-store databases have gained popularity due to their ability to efficiently store and query large amounts of data. However, query optimization remains a challenging task, especially when dealing with complex queries involving multiple joins and aggregations. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique for materialized views in column-store databases, which enables the database to prune unnecessary data and reduce the query processing time. Our approach, called ColMVIndex, leverages the column-store layout to create a hierarchical index structure that efficiently supports query optimization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColMVIndex achieves an average speedup of 3.2x compared to traditional indexing techniques.
