Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but traditional methods often suffer from limitations in capturing nuanced context and semantics. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'CAE-QE', which leverages context-aware embeddings to improve query expansion. Our method incorporates attention-based neural networks to model the relationships between query terms, documents, and their contextual information. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAE-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
