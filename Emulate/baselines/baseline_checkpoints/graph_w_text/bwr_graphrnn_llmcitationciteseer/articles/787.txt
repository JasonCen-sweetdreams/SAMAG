Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework for distributed graph databases, which leverages graph partitioning and query rewriting techniques to reduce query latency and improve system throughput. We evaluate our approach on a real-world graph dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing query optimization techniques.
