Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, often relying on simplistic term weighting schemes. We propose a novel graph-based approach to query expansion, which leverages semantic embeddings to capture latent relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'GraphEx', constructs a knowledge graph from a large corpus and learns to embed query terms in a dense vector space. Experimentation on several benchmark datasets demonstrates that GraphEx significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving an average improvement of 15% in mean average precision.
