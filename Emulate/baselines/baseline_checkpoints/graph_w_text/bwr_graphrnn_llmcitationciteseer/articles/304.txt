Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing complex relationships in modern data-driven applications. However, query optimization for real-time analytics on large-scale distributed graph databases remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphStorm', which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, caching, and adaptive query rewriting to minimize query latency. We evaluate GraphStorm on a real-world social network dataset and demonstrate an average query performance improvement of 3x compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
