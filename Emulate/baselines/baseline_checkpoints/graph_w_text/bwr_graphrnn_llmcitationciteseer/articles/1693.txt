Urban traffic management is a complex problem that requires coordination among multiple agents. This paper proposes a decentralized framework for traffic signal control using reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'TrafficAgent', consists of a network of autonomous agents that learn to optimize traffic flow by interacting with their environment. We employ a multi-agent deep Q-network to model the agents' decision-making process and demonstrate improved traffic efficiency and reduced congestion in a simulated urban scenario. The proposed framework is scalable, adaptive, and can be easily integrated with existing traffic management systems.
