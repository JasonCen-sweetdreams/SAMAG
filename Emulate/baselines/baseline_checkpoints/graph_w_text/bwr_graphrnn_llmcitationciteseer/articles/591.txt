Cloud computing has become a ubiquitous paradigm for on-demand resource provisioning, but efficient resource allocation remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'CloudOpt', that learns to optimize resource allocation in complex cloud environments. CloudOpt leverages a hierarchical architecture to decompose the resource allocation problem into smaller sub-problems, which are then solved using a combination of deep Q-networks and graph neural networks. Extensive experiments on a realistic cloud simulator demonstrate that CloudOpt outperforms state-of-the-art heuristics by up to 30% in terms of resource utilization and application performance.
