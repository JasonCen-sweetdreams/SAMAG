Query expansion is a crucial technique to improve the effectiveness of information retrieval systems. However, traditional methods rely on shallow semantic representations and often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DSE-QE', which leverages pre-trained language models to learn dense semantic embeddings for queries and documents. We demonstrate that these embeddings can be effectively used to expand queries and improve retrieval performance. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that DSE-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision.
