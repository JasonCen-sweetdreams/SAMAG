In multi-agent systems, planning and decision-making processes often involve complex interactions between agents. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HiGAT) to facilitate explainable multi-agent planning. HiGAT integrates graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical clustering to model agent relationships and identify key influencers. Our approach enables the discovery of interpretable planning strategies, improving transparency and trust in autonomous systems. Experimental results on a traffic management scenario demonstrate that HiGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of planning efficiency and explainability.
