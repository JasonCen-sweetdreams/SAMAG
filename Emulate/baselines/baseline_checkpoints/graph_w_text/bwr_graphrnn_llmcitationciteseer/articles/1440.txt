Traditional query expansion techniques often struggle to effectively capture the nuances of heterogeneous document collections, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE', which leverages both semantic and syntactic relationships between terms to construct a robust query representation. By recursively expanding the query through a hierarchical graph, HQE can better accommodate the diversity of document structures and contents. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.
