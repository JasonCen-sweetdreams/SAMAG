Time-series data is increasingly prevalent in various domains, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, querying and indexing such data in distributed database systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'TS-tree', which leverages a combination of spatial and temporal locality to optimize query performance. TS-tree adapts to varying data distributions and query workloads, achieving up to 3x query speedup and 2x storage savings compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods. We evaluate TS-tree on a large-scale IoT dataset and demonstrate its efficacy in supporting real-time analytics and decision-making.
