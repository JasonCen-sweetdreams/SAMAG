Information retrieval systems face the challenge of efficiently filtering out irrelevant documents from large collections. This paper proposes a novel approach, Deep Semantic Hashing (DSH), which leverages deep neural networks to learn compact binary representations of documents. By preserving semantic similarity in the hash space, DSH enables fast and accurate filtering of documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DSH outperforms existing hashing methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and accuracy.
