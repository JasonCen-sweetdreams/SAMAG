Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed database systems, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of modern data-intensive applications. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We design a DRL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database environment, leveraging a combination of exploration and exploitation strategies to balance query cost and optimization time. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
