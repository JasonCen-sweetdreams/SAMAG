Multi-modal time series forecasting is a crucial task in various applications, including healthcare and finance. However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex dependencies between different modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework, which leverages graph attention mechanisms to model both intra- and inter-modality relationships. HGAT consists of a hierarchical graph encoder, which learns to represent each modality as a graph, and a forecasting module, which aggregates the graph representations to predict future values. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and robustness.
