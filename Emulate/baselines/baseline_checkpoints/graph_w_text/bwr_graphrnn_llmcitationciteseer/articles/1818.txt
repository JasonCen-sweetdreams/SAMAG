Human pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with applications in fields like healthcare, robotics, and entertainment. This paper introduces 'PoseGraph', a real-time pose estimation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the intricate relationships between body joints. By incorporating skeletal constraints and a novel bone-length regularization term, PoseGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmarks like Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Our approach enables accurate and efficient pose estimation, even in challenging scenarios with occlusions or limited sensor data.
