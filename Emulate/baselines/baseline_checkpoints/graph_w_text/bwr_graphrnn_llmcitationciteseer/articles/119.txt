As big data analytics continues to grow, query optimization has become a critical bottleneck. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and statistical models, which often fail to capture complex data distributions. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach, 'ML-Optimizer', which leverages query execution patterns and data characteristics to predict optimal query plans. We formulate the optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process and employ deep reinforcement learning to learn an optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ML-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
