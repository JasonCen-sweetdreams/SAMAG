In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that involves assigning tasks to agents while minimizing communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that learns to allocate tasks efficiently by modeling agent interactions and task dependencies. Our HAN model consists of two levels of attention: intra-agent attention for task feature extraction and inter-agent attention for task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated robotics environment demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing task allocation methods in terms of allocation quality, communication cost, and adaptability to dynamic environments.
