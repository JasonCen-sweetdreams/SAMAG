Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems struggle to effectively retrieve relevant documents from a large corpus, leading to suboptimal answer extraction. This paper introduces QFNR, a neural retrieval model that incorporates query-focused attention mechanisms to selectively retrieve passages most likely to contain the answer. Our approach leverages a hierarchical encoder to jointly model query-document interactions and passage-level relevance. Experimental results on the Natural Questions benchmark demonstrate that QFNR significantly outperforms existing retrieval methods, achieving a 12.1% improvement in top-1 passage retrieval accuracy.
