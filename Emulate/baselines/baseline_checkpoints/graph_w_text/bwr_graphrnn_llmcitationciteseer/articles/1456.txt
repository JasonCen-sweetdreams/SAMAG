Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar condition or a generic avatar condition. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, presence, and enjoyment, while also reducing symptoms of VR-induced sickness. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR system design and future research directions.
