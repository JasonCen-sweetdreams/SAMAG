Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in data integration and knowledge graph construction. However, existing approaches struggle to scale to large datasets with millions of entities. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding method that leverages hashing to efficiently disambiguate entities. Our approach, called GraphHash, represents entities as compact binary codes, enabling fast similarity searches and reducing the computational complexity of entity disambiguation. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphHash outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
