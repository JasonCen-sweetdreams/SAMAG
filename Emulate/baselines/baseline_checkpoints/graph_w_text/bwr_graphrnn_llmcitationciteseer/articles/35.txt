Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various applications, but they often fail to recognize out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, leading to unreliable predictions. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian uncertainty estimation approach, 'BayesOOD', which leverages the epistemic uncertainty of neural networks to detect OOD samples. We develop a theoretically grounded framework that integrates Bayesian neural networks with a probabilistic OOD detection mechanism. Experiments on various image classification datasets demonstrate that BayesOOD outperforms existing OOD detection methods, achieving higher detection accuracy and robustness to adversarial attacks.
