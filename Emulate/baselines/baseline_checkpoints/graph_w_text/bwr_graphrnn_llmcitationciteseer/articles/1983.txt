Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require efficient coordination to navigate complex traffic scenarios. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'GAT-MA', which leverages graph attention mechanisms to model interactions between AVs and their environment. GAT-MA learns to optimize vehicle trajectories, reducing congestion and improving overall traffic flow. We evaluate our approach on a realistic traffic simulator, demonstrating improved performance over baseline methods in various urban traffic scenarios.
