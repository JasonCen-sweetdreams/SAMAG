E-commerce search engines aim to provide users with diverse and relevant product results. However, traditional ranking models often struggle to balance diversity and relevance. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'DiverseRank', which integrates a multi-task learning framework with a neural-based diversification module. Our approach leverages both explicit and implicit feedback signals to jointly optimize ranking and diversification objectives. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that DiverseRank outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both relevance and diversity metrics, while reducing computational overhead.
