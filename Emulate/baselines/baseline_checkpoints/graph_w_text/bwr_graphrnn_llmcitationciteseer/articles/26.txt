Coordinating the actions of multiple agents in complex, dynamic environments is a challenging problem. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for multi-agent systems, where agents learn to coordinate their actions through a combination of centralized and decentralized decision-making. Our approach leverages a hierarchical decomposition of the environment and a novel credit assignment mechanism to enable agents to learn effective coordination strategies. Experimental results in a simulated multi-robot warehouse environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving high levels of coordination and task completion.
