Distributed database systems (DDS) are becoming increasingly popular for handling large-scale data-driven applications. However, optimizing queries in DDS remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel graph-based modeling approach for efficient query optimization in DDS. We model the distributed database as a graph, where nodes represent data fragments and edges represent communication costs. Our approach utilizes graph algorithms to identify optimal query execution plans that minimize communication overhead and improve query response time. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing query optimization techniques.
