Skeleton-based action recognition has gained popularity in recent years due to the availability of large-scale datasets and advancements in 3D skeleton estimation. However, existing methods struggle to effectively capture complex spatio-temporal relationships between joints. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) architecture that leverages both node-level and graph-level attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant joints and skeletal structures. We demonstrate the efficacy of HAGNN on three benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and F1-score.
