As distributed database systems (DDS) increasingly employ heterogeneous storage configurations, query optimization becomes a critical challenge. This paper presents 'HeteroOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and statistical models to adapt to varying storage characteristics. HeteroOpt integrates a storage-aware cost model, a query plan enumerator, and a reinforcement learning-based plan selector to minimize query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world DDS testbed demonstrate that HeteroOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query response time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
