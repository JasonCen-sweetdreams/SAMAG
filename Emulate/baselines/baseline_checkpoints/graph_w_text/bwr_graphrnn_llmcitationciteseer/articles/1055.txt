Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complex nature of graph queries and the need to minimize communication costs in distributed systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph structural properties and statistical models to predict query execution costs. We introduce a distributed query planning algorithm that adaptively adjusts to changing data distributions and system workloads. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
