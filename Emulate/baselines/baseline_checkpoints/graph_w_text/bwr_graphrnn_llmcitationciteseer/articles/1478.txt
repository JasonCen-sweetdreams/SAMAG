Autonomous traffic management is a complex problem that requires coordination among multiple agents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'HiMAT', which enables autonomous vehicles to learn decentralized policies for traffic signal control. HiMAT consists of two layers: a high-level layer that learns to allocate green light times to intersections, and a low-level layer that learns to control individual traffic signals. We evaluate HiMAT in a realistic simulation environment and show that it outperforms traditional signal control methods in terms of reducing congestion and travel time.
