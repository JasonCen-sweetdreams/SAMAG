Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but current gesture recognition systems often rely on abstracted representations of the user's body. This paper explores the concept of embodiment in VR-based gesture recognition, examining how the user's sense of bodily presence affects their interaction with virtual objects. We designed and evaluated a novel VR system that incorporates a 3D avatar and haptic feedback, demonstrating significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user experience compared to traditional controller-based approaches. Our findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and immersive VR interfaces.
