Real-time traffic prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this domain, their scalability remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'GTS', a novel GNN architecture that leverages hierarchical graph clustering and parallelized message passing to achieve scalability. We demonstrate GTS's effectiveness on large-scale traffic networks, achieving 15% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by 60%. Our approach enables real-time traffic prediction and has implications for urban planning and autonomous vehicles.
