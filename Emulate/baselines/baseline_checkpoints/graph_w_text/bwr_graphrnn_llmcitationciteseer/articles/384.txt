In edge computing, efficient resource allocation is crucial for reducing latency and improving quality of service. This paper proposes a decentralized agent-based framework, 'EdgeAgent', which leverages autonomous agents to dynamically allocate resources in edge networks. Our approach utilizes a novel reward function that incorporates both local and global optimization objectives, enabling agents to adapt to changing network conditions and user demands. Simulation results demonstrate that EdgeAgent outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of resource utilization and application performance.
