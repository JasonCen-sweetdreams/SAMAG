E-commerce search engines face the challenge of retrieving relevant products from massive catalogs in response to user queries. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach, which leverages both semantic and syntactic features to disambiguate user intent. Our HQE method incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively expand query terms based on their importance in the product catalog. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of precision, recall, and query latency.
