The join order selection problem is a critical component of query optimization in distributed database systems. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize join order selection. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques, achieving an average reduction of 30% in query execution time. We also analyze the applicability of our approach to various database systems and provide insights into the learned policy.
