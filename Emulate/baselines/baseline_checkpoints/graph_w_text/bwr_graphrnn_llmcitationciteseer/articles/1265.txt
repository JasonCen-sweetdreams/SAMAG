Coordinating the actions of multiple agents in a distributed environment is a challenging problem, particularly when agents have conflicting goals and constraints. This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent coordination using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We propose a hierarchical DCOP framework that enables agents to reason about their local constraints and objectives, while also considering the global system constraints. Experimental results on a team-based robotics scenario demonstrate that our approach improves upon existing decentralized coordination methods in terms of solution quality and computation time.
