Query optimization is a critical component of database management systems, but existing methods struggle with complex database schemas. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn query optimization strategies. We represent database schemas as graphs and utilize GNNs to capture their structural and semantic properties. Our approach, dubbed 'GQO', outperforms traditional query optimization techniques on a range of benchmarks, achieving an average improvement of 23% in query execution time. We also demonstrate the scalability of GQO on large-scale databases with thousands of tables.
