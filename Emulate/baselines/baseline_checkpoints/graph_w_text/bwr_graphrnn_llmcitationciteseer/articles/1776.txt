The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to a surge in resource allocation challenges. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARLA', which enables distributed resource allocation in IoT networks. MARLA utilizes a decentralized actor-critic architecture, where each agent learns to optimize its local resource allocation policy while coordinating with neighboring agents to maximize global network efficiency. We evaluate MARLA on a large-scale IoT network simulator, demonstrating significant improvements in resource utilization and network throughput compared to traditional centralized optimization methods.
