Deep learning-based retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various information retrieval tasks. However, they often rely on sparse and incomplete query representations, which can limit their effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages contextualized word embeddings and graph-based keyword extraction. Our method, 'DeepQE', is designed to generate a set of relevant expansion terms that capture the semantic nuances of the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly improves the retrieval performance of popular neural ranking models, outperforming traditional query expansion techniques.
