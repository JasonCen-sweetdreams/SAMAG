Multivariate time series forecasting is a fundamental task in many real-world applications, including finance, healthcare, and climate modeling. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical temporal attention mechanism, 'HiTAM', which leverages the hierarchical structure of time series data to selectively focus on relevant variables and time steps. HiTAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while reducing computational complexity by up to 30% compared to existing attention-based models. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of HiTAM in handling missing data and variable-length time series.
