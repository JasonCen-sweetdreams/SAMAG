Emotion recognition from multimodal data, such as speech, text, and facial expressions, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the lack of large-scale annotated datasets. This paper presents a novel hierarchical self-supervised representation learning framework, HierEmo, which leverages the inherent structure of multimodal data to learn robust and transferable emotion representations. Our approach involves a two-stage training process, where a shared encoder is first pre-trained on a large-scale multimodal dataset using a self-supervised contrastive loss, and then fine-tuned on a downstream emotion recognition task using a small amount of labeled data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HierEmo in improving emotion recognition accuracy and robustness to missing modalities.
