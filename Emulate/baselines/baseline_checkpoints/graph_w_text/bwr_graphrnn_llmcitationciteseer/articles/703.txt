Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their usability for individuals with dyslexia remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the accessibility of popular voice assistants for users with dyslexia, focusing on the impact of phonological awareness, decoding, and fluency on interaction outcomes. We propose a set of novel accessibility features, including audio-based spell checking, real-time vocabulary simplification, and personalized linguistic adaptation. User studies with 30 participants with dyslexia demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction when these features are integrated. Our findings inform the design of more inclusive voice assistants that cater to the diverse needs of users with dyslexia.
