Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly popular, but their adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with motor disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive gesture-based interfaces that accommodate users with varying levels of motor abilities. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and opportunities, and developed a set of design principles and guidelines for creating accessible gestures. Our evaluation of a prototype system demonstrates significant improvements in usability and user experience for participants with motor disabilities.
