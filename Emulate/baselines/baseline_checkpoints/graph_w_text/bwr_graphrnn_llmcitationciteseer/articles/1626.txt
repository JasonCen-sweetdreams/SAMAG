We present a novel approach to distributed task allocation using multi-agent reinforcement learning with graph attention. Our method, called GARL-TA, leverages the strengths of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to efficiently allocate tasks to agents in a decentralized manner. We evaluate GARL-TA on a set of benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion times and overall system efficiency compared to traditional methods. We also analyze the scalability of our approach and provide insights into the learned attention patterns.
