As voice assistants become increasingly prevalent in older adults' daily lives, there is a growing need to design inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to their unique needs and preferences. This study investigates the effects of personalization on the user experience of older adults interacting with voice assistants. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, using a customized voice assistant platform that incorporated personalized prompts, feedback, and error handling. Our results show that personalized voice assistants can significantly improve user satisfaction, reduce frustration, and increase task completion rates among older adults. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing more accessible and user-centered voice assistants.
