Object detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicle systems, requiring high accuracy and low latency. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for real-time object detection. Our approach leverages a pyramid of attention modules to selectively focus on relevant regions of the input image, reducing computational complexity and improving detection performance. We evaluate our method on the KITTI object detection benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a 30% reduction in inference time compared to existing CNN-based detectors.
