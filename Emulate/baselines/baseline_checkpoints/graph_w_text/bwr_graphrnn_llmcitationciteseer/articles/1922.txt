Individuals with motor impairments often face significant challenges when interacting with gestural interfaces. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible gestural interfaces that accommodate a range of motor abilities. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 participants with motor impairments, resulting in a set of design principles and guidelines for creating accessible gestural interfaces. We then developed and evaluated a prototype system that incorporates these principles, demonstrating improved usability and accessibility for participants with motor impairments. Our findings have important implications for the design of inclusive gestural interfaces in various domains.
