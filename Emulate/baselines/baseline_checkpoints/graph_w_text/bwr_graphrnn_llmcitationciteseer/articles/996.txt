Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant contexts for answer extraction. However, existing methods often struggle to retrieve passages that contain the answer but lack exact keyword matches. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, QDE, which generates synthetic passages by iteratively applying semantic perturbations to the query. We evaluate QDE on several ODQA benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in recall and overall answer accuracy. Our analysis reveals that QDE effectively captures latent semantic relationships between the query and relevant documents, leading to more comprehensive passage retrieval.
