Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatar customization on user experience in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR system that allowed them to customize their avatars based on their personality traits. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increased user engagement, sense of presence, and overall satisfaction. We also found that users with high levels of extraversion and openness to experience benefited more from personalized avatars. These findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to enhance user experience and encourage long-term engagement.
