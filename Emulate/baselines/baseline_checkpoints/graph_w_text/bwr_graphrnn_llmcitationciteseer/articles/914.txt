Augmented reality (AR) technologies have the potential to support older adults with cognitive impairments, but current interfaces often neglect their unique needs. This paper presents a co-design approach that involves older adults with cognitive impairments as active participants in the design process. We conducted a series of workshops and interviews to identify key challenges and opportunities for AR interface design. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and personalized feedback in AR interfaces for this population. We also propose a set of design guidelines and recommendations for future AR systems that cater to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments.
