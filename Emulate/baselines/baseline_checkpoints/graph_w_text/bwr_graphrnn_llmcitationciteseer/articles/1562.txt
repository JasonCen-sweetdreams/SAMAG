As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding how users interact with virtual environments is crucial. This study explores the role of embodied cognition in shaping human-computer interaction (HCI) in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR platform to investigate how bodily experiences influence spatial awareness, object manipulation, and cognitive load. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly affects HCI in VR, with users exhibiting improved performance and reduced cognitive load when their virtual body is congruent with their physical body. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR system design and future research directions.
