As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding human-robot collaboration in immersive environments is crucial. This paper investigates the effect of embodiment on human trust and performance in VR-based human-robot teams. We designed an experiment where participants, embodied as avatars, collaborated with a robot to complete a task in a simulated warehouse environment. Our results show that embodied participants exhibited higher trust and better performance compared to non-embodied participants, particularly when the robot provided explanations for its actions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of future VR-based human-robot collaboration systems.
