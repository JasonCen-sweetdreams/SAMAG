Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for efficient query optimization in distributed databases. Our method models the database as a graph and leverages graph neural networks to learn the optimal query execution plan. We evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and scalability compared to traditional optimization techniques.
