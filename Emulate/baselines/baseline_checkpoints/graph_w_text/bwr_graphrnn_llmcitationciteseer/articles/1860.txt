Traditional vector space models in information retrieval (IR) often struggle to capture nuanced semantic relationships between queries and documents. We propose a novel approach, HyperQuery, which leverages hyperbolic geometry to represent queries in a more expressive and compact manner. By exploiting the properties of hyperbolic space, HyperQuery enables more efficient and effective document retrieval, particularly for complex queries with multiple entities and relationships. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and query latency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
