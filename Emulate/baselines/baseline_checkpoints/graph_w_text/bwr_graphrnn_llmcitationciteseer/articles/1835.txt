Query optimization is a crucial step in database systems, but traditional cost-based optimization techniques often struggle to accurately estimate query execution times. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to accelerate query optimization. We develop a neural network-based model that learns to predict query execution times from a dataset of historical query plans. Our experiments on a real-world database workload show that our approach can reduce query optimization time by up to 75% while maintaining competitive plan quality. We also explore the integration of learned index structures with traditional optimization techniques to further improve performance.
