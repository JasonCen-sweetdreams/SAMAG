Effective disaster response management requires the coordination of multiple agents with diverse capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to heterogeneous agent coalition formation, which enables the dynamic creation of task-oriented teams. Our method, called HACF, leverages a combination of machine learning and constraint-based optimization to identify optimal coalition structures. We evaluate HACF using simulations of wildfire response scenarios, demonstrating improved response times and resource allocation compared to traditional centralized approaches.
