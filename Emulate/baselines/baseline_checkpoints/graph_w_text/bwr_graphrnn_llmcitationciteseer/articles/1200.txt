The proliferation of IoT devices generates vast streams of data, making real-time anomaly detection a pressing challenge. We propose a novel deep learning framework, 'IoT-AD', that leverages a hybrid attention-based autoencoder and a one-class SVM to identify anomalies in IoT streams. Our approach achieves fast inference times by exploiting GPU parallelization and pruning redundant neurons. Experimental results on several IoT benchmarks demonstrate that IoT-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and speed, while being robust to concept drift and noisy data.
