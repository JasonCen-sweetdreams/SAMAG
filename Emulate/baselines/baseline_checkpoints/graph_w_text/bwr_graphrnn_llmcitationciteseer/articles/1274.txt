Distributed database systems are critical for modern data-intensive applications, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper explores the use of learned index structures to optimize query execution in distributed environments. We propose a novel approach, 'DistributedLearnedIndex', which leverages machine learning models to predict query access patterns and adaptively reorganize data storage. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DistributedLearnedIndex achieves up to 3x query performance improvement compared to traditional indexing techniques, while minimizing storage overhead.
