This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the impact of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load and user experience. We designed a VR system that incorporates hand-tracking technology and gesture recognition, allowing users to manipulate virtual objects using natural hand movements. In a user study with 30 participants, we found that gesture-based interaction reduced cognitive load and improved task performance compared to traditional controller-based input. Furthermore, our results suggest that embodied cognition plays a significant role in enhancing user engagement and overall VR experience.
