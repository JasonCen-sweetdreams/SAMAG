Ad-hoc search engines rely on effective document ranking to provide relevant results to users. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages neural attention-based keyword extraction to improve ranking accuracy. Our method, 'AttendRank', uses a transformer-based architecture to identify salient keywords in queries and documents, and incorporates these into a learning-to-rank framework. Experimental results on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that AttendRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, achieving a 12% increase in mean average precision and a 9% increase in normalised discounted cumulative gain.
