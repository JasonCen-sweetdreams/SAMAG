This paper presents a novel neural ranking model, Attentive Query Encoder (AQE), for efficient document retrieval. AQE employs a attention-based query encoding mechanism to selectively focus on relevant query terms and incorporate contextualized term embeddings. We demonstrate that AQE outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models on several benchmark datasets, including TREC-CAR and Robust04, while reducing computational overhead by up to 30%. Experimental results show that AQE achieves significant improvements in ranking effectiveness, particularly for queries with ambiguous or Bursty terms.
