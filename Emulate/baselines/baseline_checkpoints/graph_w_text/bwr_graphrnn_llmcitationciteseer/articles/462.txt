In decentralized multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is critical for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'AgentGNN', that utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a task allocation strategy for heterogeneous autonomous agents. By modeling agent interactions as a graph, AgentGNN can capture complex dependencies and allocate tasks based on agent capabilities, task priorities, and environmental constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentGNN outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and adaptability to changing environments.
