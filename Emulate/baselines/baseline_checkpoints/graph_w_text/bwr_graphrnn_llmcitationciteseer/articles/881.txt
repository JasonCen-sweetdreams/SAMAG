Current search engines often struggle to capture the nuances of user intent, leading to homogeneous search results. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach to disentangle query intent, enabling more diverse and relevant search results. Our method, 'IntentFuse', leverages a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query similarity, intent clustering, and result diversification. We evaluate IntentFuse on a large-scale query log dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in search result diversity and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art methods.
