Distributed databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management systems. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using graph-based indexing. Our method, called GraphOpt, leverages the graph structure of the database to identify optimal query plans. We demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time. Furthermore, we show that our approach is highly scalable and adaptable to changing database workloads.
