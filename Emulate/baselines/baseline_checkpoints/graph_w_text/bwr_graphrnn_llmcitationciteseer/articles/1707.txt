Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly popular, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with motor impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive gesture-based interfaces for this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving co-design workshops and usability testing with 20 older adults with motor impairments. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptability, feedback, and customization in gesture-based interfaces. We propose a set of design guidelines and a novel gesture recognition algorithm that can accommodate varying levels of motor ability. Our approach shows promise in enhancing the accessibility and usability of gesture-based interfaces for older adults with motor impairments.
