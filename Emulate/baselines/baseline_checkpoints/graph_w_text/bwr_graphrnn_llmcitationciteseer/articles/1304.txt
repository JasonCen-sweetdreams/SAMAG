Online learning platforms often struggle to replicate the emotional connections and instant feedback of traditional classrooms. This paper presents 'Empath', an emotive avatar-based system that provides personalized, affective feedback to learners. Our approach leverages machine learning-driven sentiment analysis and embodied cognition principles to create a more immersive and engaging learning experience. A user study with 120 participants demonstrates that Empath significantly increases learner motivation, self-efficacy, and overall satisfaction, particularly for learners with anxiety or emotional difficulties.
