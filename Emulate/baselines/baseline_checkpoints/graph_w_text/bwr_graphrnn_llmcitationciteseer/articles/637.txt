In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is a crucial task that enables agents to achieve common goals. However, existing approaches often assume homogeneous preferences among agents, which is unrealistic in many real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel distributed coalition formation algorithm that accommodates heterogeneous preferences among agents. Our approach leverages a graph-based representation of agent relationships and preferences, and employs a decentralized optimization method to form coalitions that maximize the overall system utility. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in forming high-quality coalitions that respect agent preferences.
