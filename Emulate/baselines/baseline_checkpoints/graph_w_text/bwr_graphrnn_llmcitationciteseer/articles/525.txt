Virtual reality (VR) systems often rely on visual and auditory cues, neglecting the importance of tactile feedback in creating an immersive experience. This paper presents a novel haptic feedback system, TactiVR, designed to enhance user engagement and realism in VR environments. We propose a taxonomy of haptic effects and develop a machine learning-based model to predict user preferences for tactile feedback in various VR scenarios. Our user study demonstrates a significant improvement in user satisfaction and presence in VR applications incorporating TactiVR, highlighting the potential for haptic feedback to revolutionize VR interaction.
