Short text documents, such as tweets and product reviews, pose significant challenges for information retrieval systems due to their brevity and lack of context. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HyQE', which leverages both local and global semantic relationships to enrich the query representation. HyQE first identifies relevant keywords from the query and expands them using a graph-based method, and then hierarchically refines the expanded query by incorporating topic models and word embeddings. Experimental results on several short text datasets demonstrate that HyQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
