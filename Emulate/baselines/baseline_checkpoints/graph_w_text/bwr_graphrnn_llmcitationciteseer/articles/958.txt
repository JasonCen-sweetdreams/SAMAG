Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck in these systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DistroOpt', which leverages statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to efficiently optimize queries in distributed relational databases. DistroOpt uses a hierarchical model to capture the complex relationships between query patterns, data distribution, and system resources, and applies a reinforcement learning strategy to adapt to changing workloads. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DistroOpt outperforms existing query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
