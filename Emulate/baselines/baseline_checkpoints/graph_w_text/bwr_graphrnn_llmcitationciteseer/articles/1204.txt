The increasing adoption of RDF (Resource Description Framework) in various domains has led to a surge in the volume of RDF triples, making efficient querying and indexing a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, HBFilter, which leverages hierarchical Bloom filters to accelerate triple pattern matching in RDF databases. Our approach exploits the hierarchical structure of RDF data to reduce the number of filter checks, resulting in improved query performance. Experimental evaluations on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that HBFilter outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
