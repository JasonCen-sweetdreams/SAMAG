Explainability is a crucial aspect of modern recommendation systems, as it can increase user trust and provide valuable insights for system improvement. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attentional Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) framework for explainable recommendation. HAGNN leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships and incorporates a hierarchical explanatory module to generate personalized, interpretable explanations for each recommendation. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN in improving both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
