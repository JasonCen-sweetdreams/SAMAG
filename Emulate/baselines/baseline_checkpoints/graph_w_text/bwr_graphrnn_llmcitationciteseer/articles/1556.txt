In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, this problem becomes increasingly complex when dealing with heterogeneous agents having varying capabilities and constraints. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'AgentDRL', which learns to allocate tasks optimally in such systems. By incorporating graph neural networks to model agent relationships and a hierarchical DRL architecture to handle task dependencies, AgentDRL achieves significant improvements in task completion rates and reduces overall system latency. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm scenario demonstrate the scalability and adaptability of our approach in dynamic environments.
