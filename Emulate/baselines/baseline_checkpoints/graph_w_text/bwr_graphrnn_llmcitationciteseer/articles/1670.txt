This paper presents a novel approach to open-domain question answering (ODQA) by generating neural query graphs (NQGs) to efficiently retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus. Our method, dubbed 'GraphQA', models the query-passage relationships using a graph neural network, which learns to encode the query semantics and passage relevance in a unified graph representation. We demonstrate significant improvements in passage retrieval efficiency and question answering accuracy compared to traditional keyword-based and BERT-based methods on several benchmark datasets.
