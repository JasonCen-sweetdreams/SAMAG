Conversational search systems aim to facilitate more natural and interactive search experiences. One key challenge lies in effectively capturing the user's intent and context. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach that leverages context-aware embeddings to better understand the nuances of conversational queries. Our method, dubbed 'ConverseExpand', jointly learns to represent queries, user context, and knowledge graph entities in a shared vector space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ConverseExpand on a large-scale conversational search dataset, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance and user satisfaction.
