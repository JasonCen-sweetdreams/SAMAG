Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on simplistic weighting schemes or ignore contextual information. This paper presents a novel approach, ContextQE, which leverages context-aware embeddings to capture the nuanced relationships between query terms and their surrounding context. By integrating these embeddings into a neural ranking model, we demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance on several benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that ContextQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly in scenarios with ambiguous or polysemous query terms.
