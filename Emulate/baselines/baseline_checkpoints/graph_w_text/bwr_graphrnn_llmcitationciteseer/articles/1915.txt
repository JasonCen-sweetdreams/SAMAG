This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for real-time autonomous vehicle control. Our approach, dubbed 'SafeDrive', leverages a hybrid architecture combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn robust policies for navigating complex urban environments. SafeDrive incorporates a safety shield module that enforces constraints on velocity, acceleration, and steering to ensure safe and smooth control. We evaluate our approach using a high-fidelity simulator and demonstrate significant improvements in terms of safety, efficiency, and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
