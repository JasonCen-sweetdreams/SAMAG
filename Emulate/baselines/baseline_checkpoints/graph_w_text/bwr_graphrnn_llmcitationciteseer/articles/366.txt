Multi-agent systems often require task allocation mechanisms to effectively distribute tasks among agents. However, existing approaches can be inflexible, leading to suboptimal performance in dynamic environments. This paper introduces Hierarchical Task Allocation using Deep Reinforcement Learning (HTA-DRL), a novel framework that leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning to allocate tasks in a decentralized manner. HTA-DRL learns to optimize task assignments based on agent capabilities, task priorities, and environmental constraints. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that HTA-DRL outperforms traditional task allocation methods in terms of response time, task completion rate, and system adaptability.
