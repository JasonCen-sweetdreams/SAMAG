Multi-agent pathfinding is a fundamental problem in AI research, with applications in domains such as robotics and video games. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep graph neural networks (GNNs) to efficiently solve this problem. Our method, named GNN-Path, uses a hierarchical graph representation to model agent interactions and incorporates a attention mechanism to focus on critical regions of the environment. Experimental results demonstrate that GNN-Path outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality and computation time, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.
