Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their effectiveness is often hindered by acoustic variability among users, particularly older adults. This paper presents a novel approach to designing inclusive voice assistants by creating personalized acoustic models tailored to individual users. We collect a large dataset of speech samples from older adults and propose a transfer learning framework that adapts a pre-trained acoustic model to each user's vocal characteristics. Our evaluation shows that personalized models significantly improve speech recognition accuracy and reduce error rates, enhancing the overall user experience for older adults.
