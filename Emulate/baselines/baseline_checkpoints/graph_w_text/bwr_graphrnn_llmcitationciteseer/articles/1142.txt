Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, as it directly affects the relevance of retrieved documents. Traditional methods rely on heuristics or manual tuning, which can be suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'QL-Expander', that leverages reinforcement learning to learn optimal query expansion policies. We model query expansion as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to select expansion terms that maximize the expected retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QL-Expander outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
