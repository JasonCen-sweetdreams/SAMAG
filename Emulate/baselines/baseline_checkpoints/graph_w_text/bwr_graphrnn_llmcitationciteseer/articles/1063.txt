In this paper, we address the problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents possess diverse capabilities and resources. We propose a decentralized approach based on distributed constraint optimization, which enables agents to negotiate and allocate tasks while respecting their individual constraints. Our method leverages a novel constraint propagation mechanism to reduce the search space and improve solution quality. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient task allocation while minimizing communication overhead.
