Coordinating multiple agents to achieve a common goal in dynamic environments is a challenging problem in AI research. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables efficient cooperation among agents. HAN uses a bottom-up attention mechanism to aggregate local observations, and a top-down attention mechanism to guide global decision-making. We evaluate our approach on a simulated search-and-rescue task and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and success rate compared to existing methods. Our results show that HAN is robust to varying environmental conditions and agent failure rates.
