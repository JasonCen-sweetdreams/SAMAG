Conversational search systems aim to mimic human-like dialogue, but often struggle to capture the nuances of user intent. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages dialogue history and user preferences to refine search queries. CAQE incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to weigh the importance of contextual features, including named entities, sentiment, and domain knowledge. Experimental results on a large-scale conversational search dataset show that CAQE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing query expansion techniques.
