Multi-agent pathfinding is a fundamental problem in various domains, including robotics, video games, and autonomous vehicles. Existing solutions often suffer from high computational complexity, making them impractical for large-scale scenarios. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph decomposition approach, 'HGD-MA', which enables efficient and scalable multi-agent pathfinding. By recursively decomposing the graph into smaller subgraphs, HGD-MA reduces the problem size and exploits the structure of the graph to minimize conflicts between agents. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that HGD-MA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of computation time and solution quality.
