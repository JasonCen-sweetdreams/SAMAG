Query expansion techniques are essential for improving the retrieval performance of search engines, particularly in specialized domains where users often employ domain-specific terminology. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-SD', which leverages a combination of lexical and semantic features to identify relevant expansion terms. Our approach incorporates a domain-specific thesaurus and a probabilistic topic modeling technique to generate a hierarchical representation of query concepts. Experimental results on a collection of medical and legal documents demonstrate that HQE-SD outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision and recall.
