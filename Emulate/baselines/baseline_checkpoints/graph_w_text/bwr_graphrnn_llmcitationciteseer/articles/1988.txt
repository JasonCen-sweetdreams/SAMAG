This study investigates the effect of personalized avatar embodiment on user experience in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR system using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance user engagement, presence, and overall satisfaction, particularly among individuals with high self-identity scores. We also found that the sense of agency and body ownership are crucial factors in determining the effectiveness of personalized avatars. The findings have implications for the development of VR systems that aim to provide immersive and engaging experiences.
