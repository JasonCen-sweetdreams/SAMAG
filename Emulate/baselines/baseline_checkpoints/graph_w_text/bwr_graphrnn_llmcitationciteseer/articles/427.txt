Distributed search engines are increasingly used to index large volumes of documents. However, query expansion techniques, which improve retrieval accuracy, can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE', that leverages the parallel processing capabilities of distributed systems. HQE adaptively selects the most informative terms from the query context and reweights them based on their relevance to the original query. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HQE achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional query expansion methods.
