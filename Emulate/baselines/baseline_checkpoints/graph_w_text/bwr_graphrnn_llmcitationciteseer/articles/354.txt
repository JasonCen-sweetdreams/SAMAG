Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in smart home devices, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive and adaptive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a series of interviews and usability studies to identify key challenges and preferences of older adults when interacting with voice assistants. Our proposed system, 'ElderVoice', incorporates a multimodal interface, personalized dialogue management, and adaptive speech recognition to accommodate age-related cognitive and sensory decline. A pilot study with 30 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in user satisfaction, task completion rates, and perceived ease of use.
