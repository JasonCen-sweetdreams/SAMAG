Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems rely on keyword-based matching, which fails to capture the semantic relationships between documents. This paper proposes a novel IR framework that leverages hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to model document semantics. Our approach represents documents as nodes in a graph, where edges capture semantic relationships learned from a large corpus of text. We develop an efficient retrieval algorithm that traverses the graph to retrieve documents relevant to a given query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art IR methods.
