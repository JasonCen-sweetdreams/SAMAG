Decentralized systems often rely on autonomous agents to allocate resources efficiently. However, coordinating these agents to achieve global optimality remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel decentralized coordination mechanism, 'AdapCo', which enables agents to adapt their resource allocation strategies based on local observations and peer-to-peer communication. We prove that AdapCo converges to a Nash equilibrium under mild assumptions and demonstrate its effectiveness in a series of simulations, showcasing improved resource utilization and reduced conflict rates compared to existing approaches.
