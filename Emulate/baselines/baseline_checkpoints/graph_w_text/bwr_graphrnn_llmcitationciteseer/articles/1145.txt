Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. However, most ERS methods rely on simplistic user-item interaction graphs, neglecting complex relationships between items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) framework, which leverages multi-hop graph attention to capture subtle item relationships and generate personalized recommendations. We introduce a novel explainability module that highlights important item features contributing to the recommendation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HAGNN in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
