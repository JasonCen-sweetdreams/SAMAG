Individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder affecting articulation and intelligibility, often face difficulties when interacting with voice-based interfaces. This paper presents an exploratory study on the design of adaptive speech recognition systems and personalized feedback mechanisms to enhance the usability and accessibility of voice-based interfaces for users with dysarthria. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with dysarthria, exploring the effects of speech recognition accuracy, feedback types, and user preferences on interaction experiences. Our results highlight the importance of user-centered design and the need for more inclusive and adaptive speech recognition systems.
