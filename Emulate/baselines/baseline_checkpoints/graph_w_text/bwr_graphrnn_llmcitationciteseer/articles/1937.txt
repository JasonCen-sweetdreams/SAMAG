Older adults often experience cognitive load management difficulties, leading to decreased performance and increased frustration in various tasks. This paper presents an innovative AR-based system, 'CogLoadAR', designed to mitigate cognitive load in older adults. CogLoadAR utilizes a novel combination of visual and auditory cues to facilitate task segmentation, reduce working memory demands, and provide personalized feedback. A user study with 30 older adults demonstrates that CogLoadAR significantly improves task completion time, accuracy, and subjective workload compared to traditional interfaces. Our findings have implications for the development of inclusive, accessible AR systems that support healthy aging.
