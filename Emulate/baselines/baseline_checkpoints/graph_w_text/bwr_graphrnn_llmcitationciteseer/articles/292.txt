Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to bridge the semantic gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages neural networks to learn semantic representations of query terms and expand them with relevant synonyms and related concepts. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, leading to improved retrieval performance and robustness to noisy queries.
