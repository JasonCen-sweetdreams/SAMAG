Latent semantic hashing (LSH) is a popular technique for efficient document retrieval. However, traditional LSH methods rely on hand-crafted features and suffer from limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepLSH', which integrates deep neural networks with LSH to leverage the power of learned representations. We design a neural network architecture that learns to project documents into a compact binary space, enabling fast similarity search and retrieval. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepLSH outperforms state-of-the-art LSH methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and query efficiency.
