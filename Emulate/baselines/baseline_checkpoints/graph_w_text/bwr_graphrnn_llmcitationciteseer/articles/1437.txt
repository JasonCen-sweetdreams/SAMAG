The increasing volume and velocity of big data pose significant challenges to query performance in data analytics. This paper presents an adaptive indexing framework, 'AIQ', which dynamically adjusts indexing strategies based on query patterns and data distributions. AIQ employs a cost-based optimization model that considers both storage and computation overhead, allowing for efficient index creation and maintenance. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that AIQ outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage efficiency.
