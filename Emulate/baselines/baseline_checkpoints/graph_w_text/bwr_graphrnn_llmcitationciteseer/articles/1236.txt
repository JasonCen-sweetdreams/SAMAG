In dynamic environments, task allocation among autonomous agents is crucial for efficient problem-solving. This paper presents a novel framework, 'DynaTask', which leverages a combination of machine learning and multi-agent systems to optimize task allocation. DynaTask uses a graph neural network to model agent-agent interactions and task dependencies, and a distributed constraint optimization algorithm to allocate tasks in real-time. We evaluate DynaTask in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved response times and resource utilization compared to existing approaches.
