Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Traditional query optimizers rely on rule-based approaches, which can be inefficient and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based query optimizer, 'ML-QO', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. We demonstrate that ML-QO outperforms traditional optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization. Our approach is particularly effective in handling complex queries and large datasets, making it suitable for modern big data applications.
