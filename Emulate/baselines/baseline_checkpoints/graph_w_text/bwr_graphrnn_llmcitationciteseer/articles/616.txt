Traditional query optimization techniques rely on Exhaustive Search (ES) or Heuristics, which can be inefficient for complex queries. This paper proposes a novel Neural Query Optimization (NQO) framework that leverages deep learning to predict optimal query plans. NQO integrates a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to model query structures and a Reinforcement Learning (RL) component to learn optimization strategies. Experimental results on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate that NQO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average speedup of 3.2x for complex queries.
