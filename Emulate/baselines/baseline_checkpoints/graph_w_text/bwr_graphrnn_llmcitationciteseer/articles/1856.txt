This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive gesture recognition systems tailored to elderly users with motor impairments. Our approach leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize gestures from RGB-D sensor data. We introduce a personalized calibration phase that adaptively adjusts the recognition model to individual users' abilities, taking into account their motor limitations and gesture variability. Experimental results show that our system achieves higher recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches.
