The join order problem is a fundamental challenge in query optimization, particularly for complex queries involving multiple tables and joins. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics or exhaustive enumeration, which can lead to suboptimal plans and poor performance. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize join order enumeration. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and train a deep Q-network to learn the optimal join order for a given query pattern. Experiments on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of execution time and 2x in terms of memory usage.
