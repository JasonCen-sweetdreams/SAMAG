Real-time database systems (RTDBS) require predictable and efficient concurrency control mechanisms to ensure timely access to shared data. This paper presents a novel scalable concurrency control algorithm, 'RT-CC', which leverages a hybrid approach combining optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control techniques. RT-CC dynamically adjusts its strategy based on system workload and data contention, resulting in improved throughput and reduced latency compared to traditional locking-based approaches. Experimental evaluation on a real-world RTDBS benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of RT-CC in supporting high-performance and low-latency transactions.
