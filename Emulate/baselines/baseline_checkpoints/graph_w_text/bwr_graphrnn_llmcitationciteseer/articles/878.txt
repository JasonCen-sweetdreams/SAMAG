Voice assistants have become integral to smart home technologies, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant that caters to this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify usability challenges and preferences. Our findings inform the development of 'ElderVoice', a voice assistant that incorporates adaptive speech recognition, personalized prompts, and multimodal output. A usability evaluation with 30 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
