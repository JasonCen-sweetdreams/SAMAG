Despite advances in conversational AI, few-shot intent detection and slot filling remain challenging tasks, especially when dealing with scarce annotated data. This paper proposes a novel multi-task learning framework, 'FS-IDSF', which jointly learns intent detection and slot filling in a few-shot setting. Our approach leverages a meta-learning strategy to adapt to new intents and slots, and incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to effectively capture context-dependent relationships between intents and slots. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that FS-IDSF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot intent detection and slot filling, achieving improved accuracy and robustness.
