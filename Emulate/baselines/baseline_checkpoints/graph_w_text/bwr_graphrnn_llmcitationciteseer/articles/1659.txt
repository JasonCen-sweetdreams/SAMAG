Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it aims to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion, which leverages deep learning-based semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'SemExp', learns dense vector representations of words and phrases from large-scale text corpora and integrates them into a probabilistic retrieval framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemExp significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving substantial improvements in precision and recall.
