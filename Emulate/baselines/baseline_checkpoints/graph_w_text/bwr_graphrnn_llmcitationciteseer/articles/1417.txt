The increasing adoption of AI systems in safety-critical domains has raised concerns about their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting adversarial attacks in time-series data using graph attention networks (GATs). We demonstrate that GATs can learn to identify subtle patterns in the graph-structured representation of time-series data, enabling the detection of sophisticated attacks. Our experiments on a real-world power grid dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting adversarial attacks, with an F1-score of 0.95. The proposed method has significant implications for the development of robust AI systems in domains such as smart grids and industrial control systems.
