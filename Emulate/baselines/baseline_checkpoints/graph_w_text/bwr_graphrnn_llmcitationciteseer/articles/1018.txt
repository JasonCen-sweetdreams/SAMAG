Virtual reality (VR) technology has made significant strides in recent years, but the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of haptic feedback on user experience in VR. We designed a custom VR platform with varying levels of haptic feedback and conducted a user study with 30 participants. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user engagement, reduces motion sickness, and enhances overall user satisfaction. We also identify key factors influencing the effectiveness of haptic feedback, including stimulus type and intensity. Our findings have important implications for the design of future VR systems.
