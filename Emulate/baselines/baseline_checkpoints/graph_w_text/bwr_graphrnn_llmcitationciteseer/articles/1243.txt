Virtual reality (VR) has seen significant growth in recent years, but user experience remains a major challenge. This paper investigates the role of customizable avatars in enhancing user engagement and immersion in VR environments. We designed a user study with 120 participants, who interacted with a VR platform using either a default or customized avatar. Our results show that customized avatars lead to increased user satisfaction, reduced cybersickness, and improved task performance. We also identify key design factors influencing avatar customization, including facial resemblance, body shape, and attire. Our findings have implications for the development of more inclusive and effective VR systems.
