Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) are crucial for building trust with users. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention (HGA) framework that captures complex relationships between users, items, and attributes. HGA learns to selectively focus on relevant graph neighborhoods and attributes, generating interpretable explanations for recommended items. Our experiments on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HGA outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
