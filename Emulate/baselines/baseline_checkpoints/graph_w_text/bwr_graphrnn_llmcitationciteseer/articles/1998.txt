This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for multi-agent dialogue systems, enabling explainable decision-making in complex conversational scenarios. Our approach integrates task-oriented and social dialogue management, allowing agents to adapt to changing contexts and user preferences. We evaluate our HAN model on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in dialogue coherence, relevance, and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we provide visual analytics tools to facilitate understanding of the attention mechanisms, enhancing transparency and trust in AI-driven dialogue systems.
