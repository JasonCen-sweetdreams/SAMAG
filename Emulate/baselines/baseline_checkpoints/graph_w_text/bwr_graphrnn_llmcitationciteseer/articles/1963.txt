Autonomous warehouse management requires efficient task planning and execution to optimize productivity and reduce costs. This paper presents a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planning framework that leverages Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to coordinate robots and warehouse workers. Our approach, called HTN-MARL, decomposes complex tasks into sub-tasks and allocates them to agents based on their capabilities and availability. We evaluate HTN-MARL in a simulated warehouse environment and show that it outperforms traditional HTN planning methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
