Traditional document ranking models in information retrieval rely on hand-crafted features and ignore the structural relationships between documents. We propose a novel graph-based neural network approach, ProxRank, which incorporates proximity information and document relationships to improve ranking accuracy. ProxRank models document similarity as a graph and leverages graph convolutional networks to learn a representation that captures both local and global document relationships. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProxRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models while reducing computational overhead by 30%.
