As voice assistants become ubiquitous in smart homes, it is essential to ensure their accessibility and usability for diverse user populations. This paper presents a novel proxemic-aware voice assistant system that adaptively adjusts its interaction modalities based on the user's physical proximity, body orientation, and movement patterns. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, including individuals with disabilities, and found that our system improves the overall user experience, reduces errors, and enhances user satisfaction. Our approach has significant implications for designing inclusive and context-aware interactive systems in smart home environments.
