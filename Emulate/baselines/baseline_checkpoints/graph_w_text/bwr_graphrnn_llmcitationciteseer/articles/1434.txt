Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for anomaly detection using deep learning techniques. We represent time series data as graphs, where each node corresponds to a time step, and edges capture temporal dependencies. We then employ a graph convolutional network (GCN) to learn a robust representation of normal patterns and identify anomalies. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
