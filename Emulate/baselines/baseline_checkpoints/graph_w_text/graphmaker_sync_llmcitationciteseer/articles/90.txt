Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, where multiple tenants share the same database instance. However, optimizing queries for multiple tenants poses significant challenges due to varying workload patterns and resource constraints. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MultiOpt', which leverages machine learning techniques to predict query performance and adaptively allocate resources. We propose a hierarchical optimization approach that considers both tenant-level and system-level constraints, resulting in improved query throughput and reduced latency. Experiments on a real-world multi-tenant database system demonstrate the effectiveness of MultiOpt in achieving scalable query optimization.
