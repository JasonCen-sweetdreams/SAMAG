In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem due to the lack of global knowledge and communication constraints. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to learn decentralized task allocation policies. We formulate the task allocation problem as a Markov decision process and design a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to learn from their local interactions. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient and adaptive task allocation compared to traditional optimization-based methods.
