Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its accessibility for users with visual impairments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework that incorporates auditory and haptic feedback to facilitate navigation and interaction for visually impaired users. We conducted a user study to evaluate the usability and accessibility of our proposed framework, which resulted in significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our findings have important implications for the development of inclusive VR applications that can benefit a broader user population.
