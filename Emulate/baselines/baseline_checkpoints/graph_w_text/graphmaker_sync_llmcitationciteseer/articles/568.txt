Sparse information retrieval systems, where relevant documents are scarce, pose significant challenges for search engines. This paper presents a novel query-driven document expansion approach, dubbed 'SparseXPand', which leverages contextualized language models to generate synthetic documents that augment the original sparse collection. By incorporating these expanded documents into the retrieval process, SparseXPand improves the recall of relevant documents by up to 25% compared to state-of-the-art sparse retrieval methods. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SparseXPand in enhancing retrieval performance, particularly for rare queries.
