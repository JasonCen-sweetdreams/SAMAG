Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has emerged as a crucial technique for AI applications. However, existing KGE methods struggle to capture complex relationships and hierarchical structures inherent in large-scale knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) for KGE, which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant entities and relationships. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on link prediction and entity classification tasks.
