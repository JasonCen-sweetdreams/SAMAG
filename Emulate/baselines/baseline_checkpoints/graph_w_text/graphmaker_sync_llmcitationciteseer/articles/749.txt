With the increasing adoption of distributed column stores, query optimization has become a critical challenge. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, often leading to suboptimal query plans. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-Opt', that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. We design a custom reward function that balances query latency and resource utilization, and demonstrate that RL-Opt significantly outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques on a range of benchmark queries. Our experiments on a distributed column store prototype show that RL-Opt reduces query latency by up to 3x and improves resource utilization by up to 2x.
