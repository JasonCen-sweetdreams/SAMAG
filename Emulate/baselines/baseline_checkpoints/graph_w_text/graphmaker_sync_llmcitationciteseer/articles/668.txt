Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus and then extracting the answer. However, the passage retrieval step is computationally expensive and often bottlenecks the overall pipeline. This paper proposes a novel approach, HierDPR, which leverages hierarchical dense embeddings to efficiently retrieve top-k passages. We introduce a multi-level hierarchical clustering method that reduces the number of passage embeddings to be computed, resulting in significant speedup. Our experiments on several ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that HierDPR achieves comparable or better retrieval performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational cost by up to 75%.
