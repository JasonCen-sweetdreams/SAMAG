Existing document indexing techniques rely on traditional hashing methods, which suffer from suboptimal performance in high-dimensional spaces. This paper presents a novel deep neural hashing approach, dubbed 'NeuroHash', for efficient document indexing in scalable information retrieval systems. NeuroHash leverages a deep neural network to learn compact binary representations of documents, enabling fast and accurate similarity searches. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroHash outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of search efficiency, document similarity, and query latency.
