Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical contrastive learning framework to improve the robustness of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Our approach leverages contrastive learning to learn hierarchical representations of graph structures, which enables the detection of adversarial patterns. We further develop a white-box attack algorithm to evaluate the robustness of our proposed framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing defense methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.
