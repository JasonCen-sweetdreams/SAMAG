This paper addresses the challenge of coordinating autonomous vehicles in urban traffic networks. We propose a decentralized multi-agent system, 'TrafficHub', which enables real-time decision-making and adaptive routing. TrafficHub utilizes a combination of model-based and model-free reinforcement learning to optimize traffic flow and minimize congestion. Experimental results using a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate that TrafficHub outperforms traditional traffic management systems, reducing travel times by up to 30% and decreasing congestion by 25%
