Multi-agent task allocation is a fundamental problem in distributed artificial intelligence, where agents must efficiently allocate tasks to maximize overall system performance. This paper introduces a novel approach, Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), that leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex agent interactions and task dependencies. HGAT is designed to scale to large numbers of agents and tasks, outperforming existing methods in terms of allocation efficiency and adaptability to dynamic environments. We evaluate HGAT on a series of simulated logistics scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.
