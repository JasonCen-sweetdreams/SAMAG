Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph queries and the need to balance query performance with data distribution and communication costs. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, GraphRL, learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphRL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and reduces resource utilization by up to 40%.
