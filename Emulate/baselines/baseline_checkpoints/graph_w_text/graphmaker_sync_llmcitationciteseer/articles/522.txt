Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning. This paper presents a novel deep meta-learning approach that learns to adapt to new tasks with limited data. We introduce a task embedding module that generates adaptive, contextualized embeddings for each task, allowing the model to effectively transfer knowledge across tasks. Our approach, called 'AdapTask', achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including mini-ImageNet and CIFAR-FS, and demonstrates robustness to varying task distributions and difficulties.
