In multi-agent systems, negotiation strategies play a crucial role in achieving mutually beneficial agreements. However, existing approaches often struggle to adapt to dynamic environments, where agents' preferences and goals may change over time. This paper presents a novel adaptive negotiation framework, 'DynaNeg', which leverages machine learning and opponent modeling to improve negotiation outcomes. DynaNeg employs a hybrid approach, combining case-based reasoning with reinforcement learning, to adapt to changing agent behaviors and preferences. Experimental results in a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate that DynaNeg outperforms state-of-the-art negotiation strategies in terms of agreement quality and negotiation efficiency.
