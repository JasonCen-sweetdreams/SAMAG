The increasing volume of web data has made efficient document retrieval a critical component of modern search engines. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach that leverages deep learning models to effectively capture query semantics and expand user queries. Our approach, dubbed 'NQE', incorporates a dual-encoder architecture that jointly learns query and document representations, allowing for efficient query expansion and document ranking. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to traditional query expansion methods.
