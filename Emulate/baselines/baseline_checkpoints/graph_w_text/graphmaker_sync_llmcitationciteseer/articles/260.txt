Complex autonomous systems require efficient planning and decision-making capabilities to accomplish tasks in dynamic environments. This paper presents a novel hierarchical task network planning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize task allocation and execution. Our approach, called HRL-TP, leverages a hierarchical decomposition of tasks to reduce the planning complexity and employs a DRL agent to adaptively adjust the task priorities and resource allocations. Experimental results on a simulated autonomous vehicle scenario demonstrate that HRL-TP significantly outperforms traditional planning methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
