This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems by synthesizing controllers that satisfy temporal logic specifications. We introduce a hierarchical planning framework that decomposes the global specification into local tasks, which are then allocated to individual agents using a distributed constraint satisfaction algorithm. Our approach is evaluated in a simulated robotics scenario, where a team of robots must cooperate to achieve a common goal while avoiding collisions and respecting safety constraints. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating correct-by-construction controllers that satisfy the desired specifications.
