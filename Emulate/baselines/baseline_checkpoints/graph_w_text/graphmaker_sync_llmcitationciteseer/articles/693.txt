The increasing adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices has heightened the need for efficient anomaly detection systems. This paper introduces 'GraphAnom', a real-time anomaly detection framework that leverages explainable graph convolutional networks (EGCNs) to identify anomalies in IIoT sensor data. GraphAnom exploits the graph structure of IIoT devices to model complex relationships between sensors and captures subtle patterns indicative of anomalies. Our approach provides interpretable explanations for detected anomalies, facilitating timely interventions. Experimental results on a large-scale IIoT dataset demonstrate the superiority of GraphAnom over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and speed.
