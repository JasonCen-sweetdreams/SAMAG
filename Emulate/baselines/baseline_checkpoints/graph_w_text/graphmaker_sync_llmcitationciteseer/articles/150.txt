Sentiment analysis in online reviews is a crucial task for businesses, but existing techniques struggle to capture the nuances of multimodal data. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that integrates visual and textual features to analyze sentiment in online reviews. Our approach employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant regions of the image and corresponding textual descriptions. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset of online reviews demonstrate that our HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of sentiment classification accuracy and aspect-level sentiment analysis.
