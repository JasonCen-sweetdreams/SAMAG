Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance accessibility for users with visual impairments, but existing VR systems often rely on visual cues, excluding these users from immersive experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that utilize audio and haptic feedback to facilitate navigation and interaction. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with visual impairments, demonstrating that our approach enables them to successfully complete tasks and feel more immersed in the virtual environment. We provide guidelines for VR designers to create more inclusive experiences, promoting equal access to immersive technologies.
