Autonomous agents are increasingly being used in various applications, such as search and rescue, surveillance, and smart cities. Task allocation is a critical component of these systems, as it directly affects the overall performance and efficiency. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation approach using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) for autonomous agents. Our approach leverages the DCOP framework to model task allocation as a constraint satisfaction problem, which is then solved using a distributed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of solution quality, scalability, and communication overhead.
