As data warehouses increasingly span multiple cloud providers, optimizing queries across distributed, heterogeneous systems becomes crucial. This paper presents 'CloudQ', a novel distributed query optimization framework that leverages machine learning to predict query execution times and adaptively schedules sub-queries across cloud regions. We introduce a novel cost model that incorporates data locality, network latency, and resource availability, and demonstrate that CloudQ outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in reducing query latency and improving resource utilization.
