Few-shot image classification remains a challenging task in machine learning, requiring models to generalize from scarce data. This paper presents a novel meta-learning approach that leverages hierarchical attention networks (HANs) to adapt to new classes with limited examples. Our method, dubbed 'MetaHAN', employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant features and filter out noise. We evaluate MetaHAN on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform state-of-the-art few-shot classification methods, especially when dealing with low-data regimes.
