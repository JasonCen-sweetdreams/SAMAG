Data warehousing is a crucial component of business intelligence, but processing complex hierarchical queries can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel decomposition strategy, 'HierDecomp', which leverages query rewriting and factorization to optimize query execution. We show that HierDecomp reduces query response time by an average of 30% compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining query correctness and integrity. Experimental results on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in supporting real-world data analytics workloads.
