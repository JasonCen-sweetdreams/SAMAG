Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a crucial task in various AI applications. However, existing methods suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large-scale graphs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for KGE, which leverages a hierarchical structure to selectively focus on relevant subgraphs and reduce the computational cost. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of HGAT on several benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of both scalability and embedding quality.
