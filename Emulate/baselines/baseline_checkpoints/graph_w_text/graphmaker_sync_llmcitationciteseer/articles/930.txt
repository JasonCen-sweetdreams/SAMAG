This paper proposes a hybrid agent-based framework for real-time traffic management, integrating both centralized and decentralized approaches. The framework leverages multi-agent systems to model and simulate dynamic traffic scenarios, while incorporating machine learning algorithms to optimize traffic signal control. We evaluate the framework using a real-world traffic dataset and demonstrate improved traffic flow and reduced congestion compared to traditional traffic management systems. The proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize traffic management in smart cities, enabling real-time adaptation to changing traffic conditions.
