The increasing complexity of IoT networks necessitates efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper proposes a decentralized, agent-based approach that leverages reinforcement learning to allocate resources in dynamic IoT environments. Our framework, 'DARA', utilizes a network of autonomous agents that learn to optimize resource allocation based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. We evaluate DARA on a simulated IoT network and demonstrate improved resource utilization, reduced latency, and enhanced adaptability to network changes compared to traditional centralized approaches.
