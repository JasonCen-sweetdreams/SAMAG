Distributed search systems pose significant challenges in terms of scalability, efficiency, and accuracy. This paper presents a novel hybrid ranking model, 'Hydra', which combines the strengths of both neural and traditional ranking methods. Hydra leverages a neural network-based approach for document representation and a probabilistic ranking model for efficient scoring. Our experiments on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that Hydra outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of mean average precision and query latency, while reducing computational overhead by up to 30%.
