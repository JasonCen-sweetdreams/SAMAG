Knowledge graphs have become a vital component in modern information retrieval systems, enabling the incorporation of semantic relationships between entities. However, the complexity of query formulation and the sheer scale of these graphs hinder efficient document retrieval. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'QueryRefine', which leverages attention mechanisms and graph convolutional networks to reformulate user queries. We demonstrate that QueryRefine significantly improves retrieval efficiency and accuracy by reducing the search space and identifying relevant entities. Experiments on a large-scale knowledge graph dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision.
