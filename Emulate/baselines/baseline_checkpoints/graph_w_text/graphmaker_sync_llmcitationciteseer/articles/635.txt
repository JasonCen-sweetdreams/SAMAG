The increasing adoption of deep neural networks in real-world applications has made them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing detection methods are limited by their inability to capture complex relationships between input features. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that models input data as a graph and leverages attention mechanisms to identify suspicious patterns. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art detectors on benchmark datasets and demonstrates robustness against various attack types, including white-box and black-box attacks.
