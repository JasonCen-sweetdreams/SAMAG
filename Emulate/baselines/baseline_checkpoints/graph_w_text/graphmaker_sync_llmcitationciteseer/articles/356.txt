Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their usability for older adults remains a concern. This paper presents an embodied agent-based approach to designing accessible conversational interfaces for this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 older adults, exploring their perceptions of embodied agents and their role in facilitating conversational engagement. Our findings highlight the importance of agent embodiment, multimodal feedback, and context-aware dialogue management in promoting accessibility and trust. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating inclusive conversational interfaces and discuss their implications for older adult care and social interaction.
