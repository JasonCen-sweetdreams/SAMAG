Traditional ranking models in information retrieval (IR) rely on hand-crafted features, which can be limited in capturing complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper explores the application of neural ranking models to improve query performance in document retrieval. We propose a novel neural architecture, 'NeuRank', which leverages transformer-based encoders to capture contextualized query-document interactions. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art traditional ranking models.
