Explainable recommendation systems have gained popularity in recent years, but existing methods often rely on simplistic graph structures or ignore complex user-item relationships. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework that leverages hierarchical graph attention mechanisms to capture multi-scale user-item interactions. HGAT integrates item-category relationships, user preferences, and item features into a unified graph, enabling Explainable Recommendation Systems (ERS) to provide transparent and accurate recommendations. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and interpretability.
