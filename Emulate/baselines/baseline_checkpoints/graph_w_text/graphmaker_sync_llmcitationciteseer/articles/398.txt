Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to augment the original query with relevant terms to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'SemExpan', which leverages semantic similarity graphs to identify related terms. By modeling the query and document terms as nodes in a graph, we compute their semantic similarities using graph convolutional networks. Experimental results on the TREC benchmarks demonstrate that SemExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision and recall, while reducing the computational overhead.
