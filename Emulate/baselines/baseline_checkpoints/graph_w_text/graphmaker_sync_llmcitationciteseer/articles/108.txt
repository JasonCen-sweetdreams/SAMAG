Urban traffic management is a complex problem that requires coordinating multiple autonomous agents to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to train agents to cooperate and make decisions in real-time. We introduce a multi-agent deep Q-network (MA-DQN) that learns to optimize traffic signal control, lane usage, and routing for multiple agents. Experimental results on a simulated urban traffic network demonstrate significant reductions in travel time, congestion, and emissions compared to traditional traffic management systems.
