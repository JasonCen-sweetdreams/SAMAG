Few-shot learning has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to adapt to new tasks with limited labeled data. However, existing approaches often rely on complex meta-learning frameworks or expensive data augmentation techniques. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant input features and adapt to new tasks with minimal labeled data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet, and demonstrates robustness to varying levels of label scarcity.
