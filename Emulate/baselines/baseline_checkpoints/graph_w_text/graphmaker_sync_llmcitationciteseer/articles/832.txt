Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query representations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'RNeQT', which leverages reinforced neural query translation to generate high-quality query expansions. Our method uses a deep reinforcement learning framework to learn a policy for query translation, allowing the system to adapt to the nuances of natural language queries. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
