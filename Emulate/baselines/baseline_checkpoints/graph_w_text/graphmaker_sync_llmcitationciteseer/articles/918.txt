Few-shot learning has emerged as a crucial problem in machine learning, where models must adapt to new classes with limited data. This paper presents Hierarchical Prototypical Networks (HPN), a novel architecture that leverages a hierarchical clustering approach to learn robust prototypes. HPN demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on multiple few-shot learning benchmarks, including mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet. We show that HPN's hierarchical structure enables more effective aggregation of prototypes, leading to improved few-shot classification accuracy and reduced overfitting.
