In this paper, we present a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages distributed coalition formation among heterogeneous agents. Our approach, called AgentCoal, enables agents to form coalitions based on their capabilities, preferences, and task requirements. We propose a novel distributed algorithm that utilizes a combination of graph theory and game-theoretic concepts to facilitate coalition formation and task assignment. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentCoal outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time, agent satisfaction, and system adaptability in dynamic environments.
