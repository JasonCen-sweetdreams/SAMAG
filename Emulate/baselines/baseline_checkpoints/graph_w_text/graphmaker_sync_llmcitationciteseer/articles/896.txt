Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, particularly in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) where node types and relationships vary. Existing methods often ignore the rich contextual information in HINs, leading to suboptimal query expansion. We propose a novel context-aware query expansion framework, CAQE, which leverages node embeddings and meta-paths to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and entities in the HIN. CAQE adaptively selects the most relevant expansion terms based on the query context, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental evaluations on real-world HIN datasets demonstrate the superiority of CAQE over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
