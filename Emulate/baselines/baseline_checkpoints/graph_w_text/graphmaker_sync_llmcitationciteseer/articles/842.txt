Coordinating multiple agents to achieve a common goal is a longstanding problem in artificial intelligence. Existing methods often rely on centralized controllers or simplistic communication protocols, neglecting the complexity of real-world multi-agent systems. This paper introduces Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs), a novel architecture that enables agents to selectively focus on relevant teammates and tasks, thereby facilitating more effective cooperation. We demonstrate the explainability of HANs through visualizations of attention weights, providing insights into the decision-making process. Experimental results on a range of cooperative tasks show that HANs outperform state-of-the-art methods while improving interpretability.
