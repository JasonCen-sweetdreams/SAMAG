Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems often struggle with capturing complex document relationships and semantics. We propose a novel approach, HierGNN-IR, which leverages hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to model document structures and interactions. By representing documents as nodes in a graph, we can capture both local and global dependencies, enabling more accurate retrieval. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, particularly for long-tail queries. We also introduce a new evaluation metric, Graph-based Retrieval Performance (GRP), to better assess IR system performance in graph-based settings.
