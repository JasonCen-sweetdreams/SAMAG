Cloud computing has become a ubiquitous paradigm for scalable and on-demand computing resources. However, efficient resource allocation remains a significant challenge, particularly in dynamic and heterogeneous environments. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'CloudOpt', which learns to optimize resource allocation policies in cloud data centers. By leveraging a hybrid actor-critic architecture and a carefully designed reward function, CloudOpt achieves significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and energy efficiency compared to traditional heuristic-based approaches. We evaluate CloudOpt on a realistic cloud simulation platform and demonstrate its scalability and adaptability to diverse workload patterns.
