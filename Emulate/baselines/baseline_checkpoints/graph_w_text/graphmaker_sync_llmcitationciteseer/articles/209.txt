As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, designing intuitive and engaging interfaces is crucial. This study investigates the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience and engagement in VR. We developed a custom VR platform with varying levels of haptic feedback and conducted a user study with 30 participants. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user engagement, reduces cognitive load, and enhances overall satisfaction. We also identify specific design recommendations for incorporating haptic feedback in VR interfaces, highlighting the importance of synchronization and tactile cues.
