In multi-agent systems, negotiation protocols enable agents to reach mutually beneficial agreements. However, existing protocols often assume complete information about the agents' preferences and utilities. This paper proposes a novel decentralized negotiation protocol, 'INCOP', which accommodates incomplete information and uncertainty. INCOP leverages Bayesian learning and iterative refinement to enable agents to update their beliefs and negotiate effectively. We evaluate INCOP through extensive simulations, demonstrating its robustness and efficacy in various scenarios, including those with heterogeneous agent populations and dynamic utility functions.
