Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, are increasingly prevalent in daily life. However, people with disabilities often face barriers in using these technologies due to inaccessible design. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for designing inclusive conversational interfaces, incorporating insights from user studies with individuals with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We introduce a set of accessibility guidelines and a novel evaluation methodology, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving user experience and task completion rates for users with disabilities.
