Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults, but existing VR interfaces often neglect accessibility considerations. This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of an accessible VR interface tailored to the needs of older adults. Our interface incorporates several novel features, including voice-controlled navigation, high-contrast visual cues, and personalized font sizes. We conducted a usability study with 20 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to commercial VR systems. Our findings provide actionable insights for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to the diverse needs of older adults.
