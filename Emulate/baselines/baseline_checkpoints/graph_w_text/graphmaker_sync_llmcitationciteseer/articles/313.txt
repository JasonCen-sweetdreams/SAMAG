Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel query optimization approach that leverages heuristics to reduce the search space of possible query plans. Our method, called HEO, integrates a cost-based optimizer with a set of graph-specific heuristics that capture the structural properties of the data. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that HEO outperforms existing query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 3.2x in query execution time.
