This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, called TARL, leverages a decentralized, actor-critic architecture to learn task assignment policies that maximize global rewards while respecting agent capabilities and constraints. Experimental results on a range of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that TARL outperforms state-of-the-art heuristics in terms of task completion rate, latency, and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
