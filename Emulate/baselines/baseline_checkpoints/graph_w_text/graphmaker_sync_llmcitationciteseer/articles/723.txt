Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, QDE, which leverages the question's semantic context to expand the initial document set. QDE uses a combination of keyword extraction, semantic role labeling, and graph-based ranking to identify and weight relevant expansion terms. Our experiments on the SQuAD dataset demonstrate that QDE significantly improves passage retrieval accuracy and downstream QA performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially for questions with ambiguous or multipart answers.
