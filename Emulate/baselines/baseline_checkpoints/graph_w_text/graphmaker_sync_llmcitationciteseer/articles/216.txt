Task-oriented dialogue systems have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but existing models struggle to capture complex relationships between user goals, dialogue history, and external knowledge. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture, which models dialogue as a hierarchical graph and incorporates attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes. We demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models on three benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in task success rate and response quality. Additionally, we provide an in-depth analysis of HGAT's ability to generalize to unseen domains and tasks.
