Gesture recognition systems have the potential to improve the quality of life for elderly individuals by enabling intuitive interactions with digital devices. However, existing systems often struggle to accommodate the varying abilities and needs of this demographic. This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive gesture recognition that incorporates user modeling, gesture segmentation, and real-time feedback. We evaluate our system with a user study involving 30 elderly participants and demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction. Our findings inform the design of inclusive HCI systems that can support the diverse needs of aging populations.
