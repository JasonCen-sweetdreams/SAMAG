Query optimization is a crucial step in big data analytics, as it directly impacts query performance and system resource utilization. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on rule-based and cost-based approaches, which can be inefficient and inaccurate for complex queries. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based query optimization framework, 'ML-QO', which leverages query execution plans and runtime statistics to predict optimal query plans. We develop a deep learning model that incorporates both syntactic and semantic features of queries, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of big data benchmarks. Experimental results show that ML-QO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
