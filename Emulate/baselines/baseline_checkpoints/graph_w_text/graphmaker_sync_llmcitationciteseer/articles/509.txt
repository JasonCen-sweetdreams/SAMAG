Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience in VR environments. We designed an experiment with 120 participants, using a 3D avatar customization system that incorporates facial recognition, body shape analysis, and personality traits. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, measured through self-reported satisfaction, time spent in VR, and physiological responses. We also identify key factors influencing user preferences for avatar personalization, including age, gender, and personality traits.
