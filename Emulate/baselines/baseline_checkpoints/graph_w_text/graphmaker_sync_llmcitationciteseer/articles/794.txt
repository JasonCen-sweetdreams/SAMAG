Join order selection is a critical optimization problem in distributed database query processing. This paper proposes a novel approach to join order selection using reinforcement learning. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for join ordering. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional heuristics and state-of-the-art optimization techniques, achieving up to 30% reduction in query execution time.
