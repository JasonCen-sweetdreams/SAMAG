Time-series data warehouses are increasingly used in various domains, such as IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, efficient indexing and query optimization remain significant challenges. This paper presents a novel indexing scheme, 'TS-Tree', which leverages the temporal and spatial locality of time-series data to reduce storage overhead and improve query performance. We also propose a cost-based query optimizer that takes into account the unique characteristics of time-series data. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing solutions by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage efficiency.
