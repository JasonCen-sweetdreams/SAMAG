Main-memory database systems have gained popularity due to their ability to provide high performance and low latency. However, optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and a dynamic reordering approach. Our framework, called 'MemOpt', considers the unique characteristics of main-memory systems, such as the absence of disk I/O and the limited availability of CPU resources. Experimental results demonstrate that MemOpt outperforms traditional query optimizers in terms of query execution time and reduces the number of CPU cycles required.
