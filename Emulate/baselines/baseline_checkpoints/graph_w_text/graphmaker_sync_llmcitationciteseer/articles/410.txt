Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in modern data analytics, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed settings. Our method, 'RL-OPT', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy for selecting efficient query plans based on the database schema, data distribution, and query workload. We evaluate RL-OPT on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
