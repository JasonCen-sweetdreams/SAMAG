Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly improve the recall of relevant documents. However, traditional query expansion methods often rely on manually curated thesauri or expensive machine learning models. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using semantic embeddings, which capture the nuances of word meanings in high-dimensional vector spaces. We introduce a lightweight neural network that learns to predict relevant expansion terms based on the semantic relationships between query words and the document corpus. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision and recall, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
