Distributed information retrieval systems require efficient query processing to facilitate fast response times. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the benefits of inverted indexing and term-partitioned indexing. Our approach, dubbed 'HybridIX', leverages a two-layer indexing structure to reduce query latency and improve throughput. Experiments on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HybridIX outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving an average query response time reduction of 35% and a 25% increase in query throughput.
