This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to optimize robot navigation in warehouse environments. Our method, called HierRL, combines a high-level task planner with a low-level motion controller to efficiently navigate robots through densely packed shelves. We demonstrate that HierRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of navigation time and success rate, while also adapting to changes in warehouse layouts and inventory. Experimental results using a simulated warehouse environment show that HierRL reduces navigation time by up to 30% compared to flat reinforcement learning methods.
