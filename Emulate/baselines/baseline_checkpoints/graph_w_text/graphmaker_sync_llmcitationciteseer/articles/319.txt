Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in Information Retrieval (IR), where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a popular technique to improve retrieval performance, but it is often computationally expensive and may not generalize well to unseen queries. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query expansion using reinforcement learning, which learns to select the most informative terms to add to the query. Our method, called RLQE, uses a deep Q-network to estimate the expected improvement in retrieval performance for each possible expansion term. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that RLQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
