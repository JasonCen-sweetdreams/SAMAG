Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but gesture recognition remains a challenging task. This paper investigates the effect of haptic feedback on gesture recognition in VR environments. We designed a user study with 30 participants, where they performed a set of pre-defined gestures with and without haptic feedback. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy, reducing errors by 23.4%. We also found that participants reported higher satisfaction and engagement levels when haptic feedback was provided. Our findings have implications for the design of more immersive and interactive VR experiences.
