Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR) due to the inherent ambiguity of user queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach leveraging deep neural networks to capture semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our model, 'DeepQE', incorporates a transformer-based architecture to learn context-aware term representations, which are then used to generate an expanded query set. Experimental results on the TREC-8 Ad-Hoc Retrieval dataset demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
