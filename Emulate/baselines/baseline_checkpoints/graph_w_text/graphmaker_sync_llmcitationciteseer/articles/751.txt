Multi-agent systems have become increasingly popular in various real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles and smart homes. However, task allocation remains a challenging problem, particularly when dealing with complex dependencies between tasks and agents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent capabilities, task relationships, and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations, showing significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing methods.
