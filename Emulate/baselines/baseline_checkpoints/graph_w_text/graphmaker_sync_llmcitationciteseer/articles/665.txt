This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. Our approach, dubbed 'GraphAgent', represents the agent-task graph as a sparse, heterogeneous network and applies GCNs to learn node representations that capture task dependencies and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a variety of agent-task scenarios demonstrate that GraphAgent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of allocation efficiency, scalability, and robustness to agent failures.
