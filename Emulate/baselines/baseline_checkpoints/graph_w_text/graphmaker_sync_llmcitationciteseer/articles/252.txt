Voice assistants have revolutionized the way people interact with technology, but their potential benefits are often inaccessible to older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive voice assistants that accommodate the unique needs and abilities of this population. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers, identifying key barriers to adoption and informing the development of a prototype voice assistant that incorporates cognitive support features, such as personalized prompts, error forgiveness, and multimodal feedback. Our evaluation results show significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to commercial voice assistants.
