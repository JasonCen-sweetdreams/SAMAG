This paper introduces Neural Query Graph Attention (NQGA), a novel ranking model that leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex query-document relationships. NQGA represents queries as graphs, where nodes correspond to query terms and edges encode semantic relationships. We propose a neural attention module that adaptively weights edge importance, enabling the model to focus on relevant query-document interactions. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 and ClueWeb09 datasets demonstrate that NQGA outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving significant improvements in terms of NDCG and ERR metrics.
