Virtual reality (VR) technology has seen widespread adoption, but securing user authentication in immersive environments remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel gaze-based authentication system, 'GazeAuth', which leverages deep learning to identify users based on their gaze patterns while navigating VR scenes. We collect a dataset of gaze trajectories from 100 participants and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract discriminative features. Experimental results demonstrate that GazeAuth achieves an accuracy of 95.6% and outperforms state-of-the-art authentication methods in VR settings.
