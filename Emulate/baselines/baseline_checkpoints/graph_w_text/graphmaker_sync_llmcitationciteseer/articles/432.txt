Deep neural networks often inherit biases from the training data, perpetuating existing social inequalities. This paper introduces a novel debiasing method, 'CausalDebias', which leverages hierarchical causal graphs to model the relationships between variables. By explicitly representing the causal structure of the data, we can identify and mitigate bias propagation. Our approach is evaluated on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in fairness metrics while maintaining competitive performance on the main task. We further provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method, establishing connections to existing fairness metrics and causal inference techniques.
