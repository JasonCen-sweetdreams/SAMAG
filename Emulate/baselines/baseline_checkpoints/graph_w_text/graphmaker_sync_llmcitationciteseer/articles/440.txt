In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that involves assigning tasks to agents to maximize overall efficiency. However, in real-world scenarios, agents often possess uncertain information about task requirements and capabilities. This paper presents a decentralized coalition formation approach that enables agents to form coalitions and allocate tasks while accounting for uncertainty. Our method leverages Bayesian learning to update agent beliefs and incorporates a novel uncertainty-aware protocol for coalition formation. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task allocation efficiency and robustness under uncertainty.
