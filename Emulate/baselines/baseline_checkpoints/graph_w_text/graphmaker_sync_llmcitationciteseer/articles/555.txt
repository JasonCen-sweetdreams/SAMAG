Gesture-based interfaces have the potential to improve the accessibility of technology for older adults with motor impairments. However, existing gesture recognition systems often fail to account for the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing accessible gesture-based interfaces for older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and healthcare professionals to identify key design requirements and preferences. Our results show that incorporating personalized gesture recognition, adaptive feedback, and multimodal input can significantly improve the usability and accessibility of gesture-based interfaces for this population.
