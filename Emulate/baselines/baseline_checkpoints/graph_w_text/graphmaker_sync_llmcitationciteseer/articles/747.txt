We present a novel task allocation framework for hybrid agent teams, comprising both autonomous and human agents, operating in dynamic environments. Our approach leverages goal-oriented reasoning to maximize team performance and adapt to changing environmental conditions. We introduce a hierarchical planning framework that integrates task decomposition, role assignment, and resource allocation to optimize team behavior. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in simulated search-and-rescue scenarios, outperforming existing task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and team utility.
