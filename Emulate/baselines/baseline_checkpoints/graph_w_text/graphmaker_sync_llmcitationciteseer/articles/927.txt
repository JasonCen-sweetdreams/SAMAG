Neural architecture search (NAS) has revolutionized the design of deep neural networks for various tasks. However, existing NAS methods are computationally expensive and often focus on simplified proxy tasks. This paper proposes a novel, efficient NAS framework, 'RealNAS', specifically tailored for real-world object detection. RealNAS leverages a hierarchical search space and a novel, differentiable neural predictor to reduce the search cost by 3x while achieving state-of-the-art object detection performance on the COCO dataset. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RealNAS in discovering efficient architectures for object detection in various scenarios.
