Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with complex queries and long documents. This paper proposes a novel neural re-ranking approach that leverages attention-based query document interaction to capture fine-grained semantic relationships between queries and documents. Our model, called QR-AttRank, utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant query terms and document segments, and then integrates these interactions to produce a more accurate ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QR-AttRank significantly outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving a 15% improvement in terms of NDCG@10.
