This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) and its implications on user experience. We designed a gesture-based interaction system that leverages the cognitive benefits of bodily engagement to enhance user immersion and overall satisfaction. Our user study involving 30 participants demonstrates that the proposed system significantly improves task performance, reduces cognitive load, and increases user enjoyment compared to traditional controller-based interaction. The findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and engaging VR interfaces.
