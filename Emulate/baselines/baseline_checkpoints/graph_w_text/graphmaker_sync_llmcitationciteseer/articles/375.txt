Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While existing methods often rely on handcrafted features or supervised learning, we propose an unsupervised approach using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our method, GraphAnomaly, learns representations of time-series data by modeling their structural properties as graphs. We introduce a novel graph autoencoder architecture that incorporates temporal convolution and graph attention mechanisms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAnomaly in detecting anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 15% in terms of F1-score.
