Patent retrieval systems rely heavily on query expansion to improve retrieval performance. However, existing methods often suffer from limited context awareness and vocabulary mismatch. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'SemExpan', which leverages deep semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between terms. We integrate BERT-based embeddings with a graph-based expansion approach, enabling the incorporation of domain knowledge and semantic constraints. Experimental results on a large patent dataset demonstrate that SemExpan outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision and a 20% increase in recall.
