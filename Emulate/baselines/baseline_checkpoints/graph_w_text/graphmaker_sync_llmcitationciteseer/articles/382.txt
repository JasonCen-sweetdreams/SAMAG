The proliferation of heterogeneous document collections poses significant challenges to traditional information retrieval (IR) systems. This paper presents a novel adaptive query expansion (AQE) framework that leverages both local and global context to improve retrieval efficiency. Our approach incorporates a deep learning-based query representation model that captures semantic relationships between terms and documents. Experimental results on a large-scale heterogeneous collection demonstrate that AQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision, while reducing computational overhead.
