This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, inspired by swarm intelligence principles. Our approach, called 'SwarmAllocator', leverages the collective behavior of agents to allocate tasks efficiently and adapt to dynamic environment changes. We employ a decentralized, self-organized mechanism that enables agents to share information and negotiate task assignments based on their capabilities and availability. Experimental results on a large-scale logistics scenario demonstrate that SwarmAllocator outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
