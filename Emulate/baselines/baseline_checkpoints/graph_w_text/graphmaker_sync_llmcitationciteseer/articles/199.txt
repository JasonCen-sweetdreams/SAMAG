Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, optimizing queries in dynamic graph databases remains a challenging problem due to the constantly changing graph structure. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the graph database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
