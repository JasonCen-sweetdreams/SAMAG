Traditional passage retrieval methods rely on sparse bag-of-words representations, which fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships. This paper presents a novel neural ranking model, 'DenseRank', that leverages dense vector spaces to improve retrieval accuracy. By incorporating a learned similarity metric and a hierarchical attention mechanism, DenseRank outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. We also propose an efficient indexing scheme that reduces computational overhead during inference, making DenseRank suitable for large-scale applications.
