Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics. However, query optimization remains a challenging task due to the complexity of distributed systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach using reinforcement learning, which learns to select the most efficient execution plan for a given query. Our approach, called QRL, uses a deep Q-network to model the query optimization problem and learns to adapt to different database configurations and workloads. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that QRL achieves significant performance improvements compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
