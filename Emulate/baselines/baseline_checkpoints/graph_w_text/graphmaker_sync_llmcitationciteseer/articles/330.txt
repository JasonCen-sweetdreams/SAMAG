State-of-the-art neural ranking models for document retrieval often rely on complex, compute-intensive architectures that struggle to scale to large document collections. This paper proposes PROXIMAL, a novel ranking model that leverages proximity-aware features to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. By incorporating proximity signals into a simple, yet effective, neural architecture, PROXIMAL achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy to more complex models. Extensive experiments on several TREC datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PROXIMAL in real-world retrieval scenarios.
