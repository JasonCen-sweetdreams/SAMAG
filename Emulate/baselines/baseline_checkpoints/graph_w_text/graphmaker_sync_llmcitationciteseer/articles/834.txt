In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism, 'DAMA', which allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, availability, and communication costs. DAMA introduces a novel bidding strategy that incorporates graph-based task dependencies and agent expertise, ensuring efficient and adaptive allocation in dynamic environments. We evaluate DAMA on a real-world disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing centralized approaches.
