The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors has led to an exponential growth in time-series data streams. However, existing indexing techniques struggle to handle the high velocity and volume of such data. This paper presents 'TSI-Adapt', a novel indexing framework that dynamically adapts to changing data distributions and velocity. TSI-Adapt leverages a hierarchical indexing structure and a feedback-based optimization mechanism to ensure efficient query processing and minimal memory overhead. We evaluate TSI-Adapt on real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query performance and adaptability.
