Explainable AI (XAI) is crucial for trustworthy AI decision-making. Node attribution in graph-structured data is a key challenge in XAI. This paper presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, 'AttributionNet', which efficiently computes node attributions for explainable graph classification. We propose a sparse attention mechanism that adaptively selects relevant nodes for attribution, reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AttributionNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both attribution accuracy and computational efficiency.
