Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but users often struggle with navigation and interaction in immersive environments. This paper investigates the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience in VR. We designed and implemented a novel haptic feedback system, 'HapVR', which provides tactile cues to users through a wearable device. Our user study involving 30 participants shows that HapVR significantly improves user satisfaction, reduces navigation errors, and enhances overall immersion in VR applications. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems and highlight avenues for further research.
