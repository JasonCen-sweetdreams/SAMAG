This paper addresses the challenge of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have varying capabilities and tasks have diverse requirements. We propose a decentralized approach using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to allocate tasks efficiently. Our method, called HeteroAlloc, models the task allocation problem as a DCOP and employs a novel algorithm that leverages agent negotiation and asynchronous constraint propagation. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that HeteroAlloc outperforms centralized optimization methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
