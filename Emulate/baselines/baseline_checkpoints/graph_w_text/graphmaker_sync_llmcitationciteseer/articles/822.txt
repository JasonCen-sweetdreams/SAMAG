Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, education, and entertainment for older adults. However, existing VR interfaces often exclude individuals with visual impairments, limiting accessibility and usability. This paper presents an inclusive VR interface design framework, 'VR4All', tailored to the needs of older adults with visual impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving participatory design workshops and usability testing with 20 participants. Our results show that VR4All significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial VR interfaces. We also identify key design recommendations for VR interfaces that cater to the diverse needs of older adults.
