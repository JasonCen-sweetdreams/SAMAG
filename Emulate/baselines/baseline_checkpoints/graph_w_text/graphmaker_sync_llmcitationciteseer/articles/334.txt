This paper proposes a novel approach to coordinating autonomous agents for resource allocation tasks using deep hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). We introduce a hierarchical framework, 'AgentCoord', which consists of a high-level coordinator that learns to allocate resources and a set of low-level agents that execute tasks. The coordinator uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy for resource allocation, while the agents employ deep deterministic policy gradients to optimize their task execution. Experimental results on a simulated grid-world environment demonstrate that AgentCoord outperforms traditional decentralized approaches in terms of resource utilization and task completion rate.
