E-commerce search engines struggle to effectively retrieve relevant items when users submit queries with limited context. We propose a context-aware query expansion framework that leverages multimodal information from product images, videos, and user reviews. Our approach incorporates a graph-based attention mechanism to identify salient context features and generate expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
