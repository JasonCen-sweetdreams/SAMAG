In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HiGAT) framework to model these interactions and provide explainable decision-making. HiGAT combines graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical clustering to capture both local and global dependencies between agents. Experimental results on a real-world autonomous driving dataset demonstrate that HiGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of decision accuracy and interpretability, while also providing insights into agent interactions and decision influences.
