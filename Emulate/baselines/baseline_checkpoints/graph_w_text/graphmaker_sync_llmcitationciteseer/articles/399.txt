Web accessibility is a growing concern, with many websites failing to provide usable interfaces for users with disabilities. This paper presents EARL, a novel layout recommendation system that leverages machine learning and crowd-sourced user feedback to generate accessible web interfaces. EARL employs a hierarchical Bayesian model to adapt to user preferences and adaptively refines its recommendations based on user interactions. We evaluate EARL on a large-scale dataset of web pages and demonstrate significant improvements in accessibility metrics, including navigation efficiency and screen reader compatibility.
