Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have become increasingly popular for deploying multi-tenant databases. However, query optimization in such platforms remains a significant challenge due to the complexities of shared resource allocation and varying workload patterns. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MultiOpt', which leverages machine learning-based predictive modeling to identify optimal query execution plans for each tenant. We evaluate MultiOpt on a real-world DBaaS platform and demonstrate substantial improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to existing optimization techniques.
