In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that learns to allocate tasks to agents in a decentralized manner. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to model complex dependencies between agents and tasks, and hierarchically structures the attention weights to capture both local and global task relationships. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our HAN-based approach outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
