Knowledge graph embeddings have become a crucial component in various natural language processing and information retrieval applications. However, entity disambiguation remains a significant challenge in these models, particularly when dealing with ambiguous entity mentions. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph attention networks to disambiguate entities in knowledge graph embeddings. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both local and global context, enabling the model to differentiate between entities with similar names. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in entity disambiguation tasks, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin.
