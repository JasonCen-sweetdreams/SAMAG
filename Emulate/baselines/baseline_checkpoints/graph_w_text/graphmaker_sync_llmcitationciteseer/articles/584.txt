Cooperative multi-agent systems require efficient task allocation to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach, called GraphAgent, represents agents as nodes in a graph and uses GNNs to learn a task allocation policy that maximizes overall system utility. We demonstrate the efficacy of GraphAgent in a simulated disaster response scenario, showing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
