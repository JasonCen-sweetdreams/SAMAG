Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents for answer extraction. This paper presents a novel approach to passage retrieval, Hierarchical Dense Representations (HDR), which learns dense embeddings for passages at multiple granularities. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively aggregates embeddings from sentence-level to document-level, enabling more accurate relevance scoring. Experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR improves retrieval quality by 12.5% compared to state-of-the-art dense retrieval models, while reducing computational overhead by 30%.
