As database-as-a-service (DBaaS) platforms increasingly adopt multi-tenancy to improve resource utilization, query optimization becomes a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'OptiMT', which leverages machine learning-based workload analytics to identify performance-critical queries and applies a suite of optimization techniques, including query rewriting, indexing, and caching. We evaluate OptiMT on a real-world DBaaS platform and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to existing optimization methods.
