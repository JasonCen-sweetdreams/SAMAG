Cold-start problem, where there is limited user-item interaction data, is a fundamental challenge in recommendation systems. This paper proposes a novel neural retrieval model, 'NR-Cold', which leverages the strengths of both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. NR-Cold uses a dual-encoder architecture to learn vector representations of users and items, and then employs a neural retrieval mechanism to generate personalized recommendations for cold-start users. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that NR-Cold outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and diversity.
