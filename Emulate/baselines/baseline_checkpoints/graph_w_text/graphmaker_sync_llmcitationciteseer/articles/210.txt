This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for adaptive traffic signal control. We propose a novel framework, 'TrafficMAgent', which enables individual agents to learn and adapt to dynamic traffic patterns in real-time. By leveraging a distributed architecture and asynchronous communication, TrafficMAgent can scale to large networks and respond to changing traffic conditions more effectively than traditional centralized approaches. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulation platform demonstrate significant improvements in traffic flow and reduced congestion.
