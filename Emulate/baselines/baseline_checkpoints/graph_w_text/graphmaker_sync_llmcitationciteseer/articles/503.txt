Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but users with dysarthria, a speech disorder affecting articulation and pronunciation, often struggle to interact with these systems effectively. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyVoice', a novel voice-based interface tailored to the needs of users with dysarthria. EasyVoice incorporates a range of accessibility features, including personalized speech recognition models, dynamic prompt adjustment, and multimodal feedback. A user study with 20 participants with dysarthria demonstrates significant improvements in interaction accuracy, fluency, and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
