This paper presents a novel gesture recognition system designed specifically for older adults with motor impairments. Our system, called 'EasyGest', uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and wearable sensor data to adapt to individual users' abilities and preferences. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that EasyGest achieved an accuracy of 92.1% in recognizing gestures, outperforming existing systems. Our results suggest that adaptive gesture recognition systems can improve the accessibility and usability of technology for older adults with motor impairments.
