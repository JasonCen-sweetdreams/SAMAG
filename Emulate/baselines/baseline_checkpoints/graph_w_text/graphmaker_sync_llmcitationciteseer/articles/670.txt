Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but designing them to evoke trust in users remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of anthropomorphic design elements on user trust in conversational agents. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment involving 120 participants, exposing them to three different chatbot designs: minimalist, anthropomorphic, and hybrid. Our results show that anthropomorphic design elements, such as facial expressions and gestures, can increase user trust, but only when accompanied by transparent and consistent language processing. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of trustworthy conversational interfaces and outline avenues for future research.
