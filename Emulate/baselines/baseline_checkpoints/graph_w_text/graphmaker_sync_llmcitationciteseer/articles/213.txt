Accurate and efficient object detection is crucial for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely. This paper proposes a novel real-time object detection framework, 'RTD-Attention', which leverages an efficient attention mechanism to reduce computational complexity. RTD-Attention uses a lightweight attention module to selectively focus on relevant regions of the input image, thereby improving detection accuracy and reducing inference time. We evaluate RTD-Attention on the KITTI dataset and demonstrate a 25% reduction in inference time while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy.
