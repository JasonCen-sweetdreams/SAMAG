As Virtual Reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding user experience is crucial. This paper explores the impact of personalized avatars on user engagement, presence, and perceived realism in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, using a mixed-methods approach to analyze both quantitative and qualitative data. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance user experience, particularly for users with low self-efficacy in VR. We also identify key design factors influencing avatar personalization, including facial features, body type, and clothing. Our findings have implications for the development of more inclusive and effective VR applications.
