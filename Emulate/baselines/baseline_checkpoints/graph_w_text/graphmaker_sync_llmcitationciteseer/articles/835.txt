Main-memory column-store databases have become increasingly popular for analytical workloads, but their indexing mechanisms often struggle to keep pace with growing dataset sizes. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'CMIX', which leverages a hybrid combination of tree-based and hash-based indexing to achieve efficient query performance. CMIX incorporates a probabilistic data structure to minimize memory overhead and uses a cost-based optimization framework to dynamically adapt to changing workload patterns. Experimental results on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate that CMIX outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of query latency and memory efficiency.
