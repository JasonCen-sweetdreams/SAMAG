Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing query execution in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our proposed framework, 'GraphRL', learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. We evaluate GraphRL on a popular distributed graph database and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
