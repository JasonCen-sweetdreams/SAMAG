Unsupervised time series anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the lack of labeled data. Contrastive learning has shown promise in this domain, but existing methods often suffer from mode collapse and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical contrastive learning framework, 'HiCAD', which leverages a multi-scale representation of time series data to identify anomalies. HiCAD uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group similar time series segments, and then applies contrastive learning to learn a discriminative representation of each cluster. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiCAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
