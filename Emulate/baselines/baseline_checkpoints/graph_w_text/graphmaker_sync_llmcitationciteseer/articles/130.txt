Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but individuals with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework, 'AccessibleVR', which incorporates multisensory cues and audio-based navigation to enhance usability for visually impaired users. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that AccessibleVR significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our findings provide valuable insights for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to diverse user needs.
