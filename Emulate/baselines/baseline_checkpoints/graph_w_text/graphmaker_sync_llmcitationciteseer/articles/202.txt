Task allocation is a crucial problem in IoT networks, where multiple agents must coordinate to achieve efficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We design a communication-efficient algorithm that enables agents to learn cooperative policies and adapt to dynamic network conditions. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion rate and energy efficiency.
