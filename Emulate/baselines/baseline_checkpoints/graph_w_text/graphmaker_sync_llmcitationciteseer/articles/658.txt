Open-domain question answering (ODQA) models rely heavily on effective passage retrieval to identify relevant information. We propose a novel query expansion approach, 'QE-Pro', which leverages a combination of semantic role labeling and contextualized embeddings to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our method outperforms existing query expansion techniques on the SQuAD and Natural Questions datasets, achieving significant improvements in passage retrieval accuracy and downstream QA performance. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the benefits and limitations of QE-Pro, highlighting its robustness to out-of-vocabulary terms and domain shift.
