Information retrieval systems often suffer from the problem of result homogeneity, where users are presented with overly similar documents. To address this, we propose a novel query expansion approach based on reinforcement learning. Our method, dubbed 'RL-QE', learns to select expansion terms that maximize a diversified set of relevant documents. We formulate the query expansion task as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that RL-QE significantly improves the diversity of search results while maintaining retrieval effectiveness.
