This paper proposes a novel decentralized autonomous system for real-time traffic management using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach leverages a hierarchical architecture, where local agents learn to optimize traffic signal control in response to real-time traffic conditions, while a central coordinator agent ensures global optimality through periodic interventions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated urban traffic network, achieving a 23.4% reduction in average travel time and a 17.1% decrease in congestion duration compared to traditional traffic management systems.
