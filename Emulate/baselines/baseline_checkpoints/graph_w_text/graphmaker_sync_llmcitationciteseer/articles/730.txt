Missing data is a pervasive problem in many real-world datasets, particularly in tabular data. Existing imputation methods often fail to capture complex hierarchical dependencies between variables. This paper presents a novel deep generative model, 'HiGen', which learns to impute missing values in tabular data by modeling hierarchical relationships between variables. HiGen employs a multi-level variational autoencoder to capture both local and global dependencies, and is trained using a novel objective function that balances reconstruction and regularization terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiGen outperforms state-of-the-art imputation methods, particularly in settings with complex hierarchical structures.
