Distributed relational databases (DRDBs) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in DRDBs remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning (ML) techniques to predict optimal query execution plans for DRDBs. We develop a query optimizer that uses a graph neural network (GNN) to learn the query patterns and database statistics. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
