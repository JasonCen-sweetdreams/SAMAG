Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it enables more accurate matching between user queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between words and phrases. Our model uses a combination of word embeddings and convolutional neural networks to generate expanded queries that better capture the user's intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms existing query expansion techniques, improving retrieval effectiveness by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
