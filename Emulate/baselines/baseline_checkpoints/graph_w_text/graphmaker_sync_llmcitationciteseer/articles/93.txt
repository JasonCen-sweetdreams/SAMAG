Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their interfaces often neglect the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create more inclusive and accessible voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify key pain points and areas for improvement. Our findings informed the development of 'ElderVoice', a novel voice assistant that incorporates age-related accommodations, such as simplified language, increased response time, and personalized feedback. A usability study with 30 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
