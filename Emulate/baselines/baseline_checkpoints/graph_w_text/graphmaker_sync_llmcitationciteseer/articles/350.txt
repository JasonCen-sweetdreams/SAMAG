Deep semantic search has emerged as a promising approach for retrieving relevant documents in information retrieval systems. However, existing techniques often struggle to effectively expand user queries to capture nuanced semantic relationships. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'GraphExp', which leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model complex relationships between query terms and their semantic neighbors. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on the most informative nodes in the graph, leading to significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of GraphExp in retrieving relevant documents, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
