As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to reduce cognitive load in conversational systems for older adults. We conducted a mixed-method study involving 30 participants aged 65-85, exploring the effects of simplifying dialogue structures, using clear and concise language, and incorporating visual cues on cognitive load reduction. Our results show that the designed conversational interface reduced cognitive load by 35% compared to standard conversational interfaces, improving overall user experience and satisfaction.
