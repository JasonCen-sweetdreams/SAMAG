This paper addresses the problem of distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a decentralized reinforcement learning approach, called 'DTRL', that enables agents to learn to allocate tasks without a centralized controller. DTRL uses a novel combination of graph neural networks and multi-agent Q-learning to learn task allocation policies. We evaluate DTRL in a variety of scenarios and show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time and agent utility. Our approach has applications in domains such as robotic teams, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities.
