This study investigates the effectiveness of adaptive font sizes in enhancing reading comprehension for visually impaired users. We developed a novel font adaptation algorithm that dynamically adjusts font sizes based on user preferences, reading speed, and content complexity. Our user study with 30 visually impaired participants reveals that adaptive font sizes significantly improve reading comprehension and reduce eye strain compared to fixed font sizes. We also analyze the impact of font adaptation on reading speed, accuracy, and user satisfaction, providing insights for designing more accessible digital interfaces.
