Specialized search engines, such as those for academic or biomedical queries, often struggle with low query clarity and sparse relevance feedback. We propose a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages both word embeddings and domain-specific ontologies to enhance retrieval performance. Our method iteratively expands the original query using a top-down strategy, incorporating semantic relationships and term importance weights. Experimental results on a dataset of biomedical queries demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain compared to state-of-the-art expansion techniques.
