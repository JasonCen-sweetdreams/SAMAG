Multi-label classification is a fundamental problem in many applications, but existing methods often struggle with scalability and accuracy. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages the power of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large-scale multi-label data. HGAT learns to represent each label as a graph node and applies hierarchical attention to capture complex label relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.
