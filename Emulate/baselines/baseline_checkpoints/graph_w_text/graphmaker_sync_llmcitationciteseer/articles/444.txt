Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve cognitive training and therapy for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often present barriers to adoption and usage. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop accessible VR interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of usability studies and workshops with 30 participants, resulting in the identification of key design principles and guidelines for accessible VR interaction. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and effective VR-based cognitive interventions.
