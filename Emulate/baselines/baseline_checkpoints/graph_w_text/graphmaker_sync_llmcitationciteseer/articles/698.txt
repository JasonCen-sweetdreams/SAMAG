Neural search engines have gained popularity due to their ability to capture semantic relationships between queries and documents. However, they often suffer from inefficient re-ranking mechanisms that fail to effectively leverage query context. This paper proposes a novel query-aware document embedding approach, 'QADE', which learns to incorporate query semantics into document representations. We demonstrate that QADE can be seamlessly integrated with existing neural ranking models, leading to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that QADE outperforms state-of-the-art re-ranking methods, achieving a 15% relative gain in NDCG@10.
