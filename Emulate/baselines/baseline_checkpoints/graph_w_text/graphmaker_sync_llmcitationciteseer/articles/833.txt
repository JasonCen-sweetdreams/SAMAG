Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query execution plans remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively learn the optimal join orders and indexing strategies for a given query workload. Our approach, called 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to predict the optimal plan based on query features and database statistics. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers and achieves up to 3x improvement in query execution time.
