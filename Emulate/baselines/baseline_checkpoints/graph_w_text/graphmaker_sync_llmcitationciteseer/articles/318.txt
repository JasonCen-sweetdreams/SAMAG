In distributed systems, efficient resource allocation is crucial for optimal performance. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARLA', which enables autonomous agents to adaptively allocate resources in response to changing system demands. MARLA leverages a decentralized Markov decision process to model the complex interactions between agents and their environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MARLA in a simulated cloud computing environment, showing significant improvements in resource utilization and system throughput compared to traditional static allocation methods.
