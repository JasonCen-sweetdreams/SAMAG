As data scales, distributed database systems require efficient query optimization to ensure performance and scalability. This paper presents an elastic query optimization framework, 'ElasticQuery', which dynamically adapts to changing workload and data distributions. We propose a novel cost model that incorporates both data locality and CPU utilizations, enabling the optimizer to make informed decisions on query execution strategies. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate that ElasticQuery achieves up to 3.2x query performance improvement and 2.5x reduction in resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
