Traditional ranking models for document retrieval often struggle with scalability and effectiveness in modern search engines. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HierRank, which leverages the strengths of both lexical and semantic matching techniques. By incorporating a hierarchical attention mechanism, HierRank learns to focus on relevant document segments and capture nuanced semantic relationships between queries and documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
