Distributed resource allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must cooperate to achieve a common goal. This paper proposes a novel decentralized algorithm, 'MACRO', which enables scalable cooperation among agents with heterogeneous resources and objectives. MACRO utilizes a hierarchical clustering approach to group agents with similar resource profiles, followed by a distributed optimization procedure to allocate resources. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that MACRO achieves near-optimal allocation efficiency while reducing communication overhead by up to 70% compared to existing methods.
