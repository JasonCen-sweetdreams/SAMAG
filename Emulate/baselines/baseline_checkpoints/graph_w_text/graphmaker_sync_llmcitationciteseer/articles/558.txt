Real-time traffic control is a complex problem that requires the coordination of multiple agents to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for coordinating multi-agent systems in traffic control. Our approach consists of a high-level controller that learns to allocate resources and set goals for individual agents, which in turn learn to optimize their local control policies. We evaluate our approach using a realistic traffic simulator and demonstrate improved performance compared to traditional reinforcement learning methods. We also analyze the scalability and robustness of our approach in various traffic scenarios.
