Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by user experience (UX) issues. This study explores the effect of personalization on UX in VR, focusing on user preferences, cognitive load, and emotional response. We designed a user study involving 30 participants, who interacted with a VR system that adapted to their individual preferences, cognitive abilities, and emotional states. Our results show that personalized VR experiences lead to improved user satisfaction, reduced cognitive load, and enhanced emotional engagement. We also identify key factors influencing personalization in VR and provide guidelines for designers and developers.
