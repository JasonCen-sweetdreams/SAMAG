Join order optimization is a crucial step in query optimization for distributed database systems. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics and rule-based systems, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn join order optimization. We model the query graph as a neural network and train it on a large dataset of queries. Our experiments demonstrate that the GNN-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of query execution time and plan quality. We also explore the scalability of our approach on large-scale distributed database systems.
