Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but its inaccessible nature excludes users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences, focusing on auditory and haptic feedback to compensate for visual limitations. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, exploring the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing user engagement and navigation in VR environments. The results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction, highlighting the need for more accessible VR design practices.
