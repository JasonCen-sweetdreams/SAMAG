As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible interfaces that can be used by older adults with dementia. This paper presents a gesture-based interface designed specifically for this demographic. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to identify key design principles and gesture patterns that are intuitive and easy to use. Our results show that a simplified, icon-based gesture set with auditory feedback can significantly improve task completion rates and user satisfaction. We also discuss the implications of our findings for future research in accessible HCI design.
