Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query processing in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between data distribution, query patterns, and system resources. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query processing in DDS. We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the system, and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving query performance and reducing resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30%.
