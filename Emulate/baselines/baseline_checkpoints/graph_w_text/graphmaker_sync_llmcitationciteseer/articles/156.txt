Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has emerged as a powerful technique for open-domain question answering, but its scalability remains a significant bottleneck. We propose a novel deep retrieval framework, 'DeepScale', which leverages a hierarchical representation of passages to efficiently prune the search space. By combining a sparse retriever with a dense reranker, we achieve a 3x speedup in retrieval time while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. We also introduce a new evaluation metric, 'Recall@k', to better capture the efficacy of retrieval models in open-domain question answering.
