Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and energy. However, existing models often struggle with long-range dependencies, seasonality, and variable importance. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that tackles these challenges by incorporating multi-level attention mechanisms. HAN consists of a hierarchical encoder that captures local and global patterns, followed by a decoder that generates forecasts using attention-weighted representations. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN, outperforming state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
