This paper proposes a novel multi-agent system (MAS) for autonomous traffic management, which leverages decentralized decision-making to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. Our approach, called 'TrafficMAS', consists of a network of autonomous agents that communicate and coordinate with each other to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings and traffic routing. We evaluate TrafficMAS through extensive simulations, demonstrating significant improvements in traffic throughput and reduced travel times compared to traditional centralized traffic management systems. The scalability of our approach is further validated through a real-world case study in the city of San Francisco.
