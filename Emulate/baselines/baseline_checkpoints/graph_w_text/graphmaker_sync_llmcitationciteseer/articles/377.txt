As voice-controlled smart home systems become increasingly prevalent, it is essential to ensure their accessibility for older adults. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, exploring their experiences with voice-controlled systems and identifying key design recommendations. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and simple voice prompts, intuitive error handling, and personalized feedback mechanisms. We also propose a set of accessibility guidelines for designers and developers of voice-controlled systems, aiming to promote independent living and social inclusion for older adults.
