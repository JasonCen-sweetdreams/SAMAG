Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their usability and accessibility for older adults are often overlooked. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the speech patterns of older adults interacting with voice assistants. We conducted interviews and usability testing with 30 participants aged 65+, analyzing their speech characteristics, error rates, and user experience. Our findings highlight the need for more inclusive design, suggesting that voice assistants should accommodate slower speech rates, varied pronunciation, and implicit command structures. We propose a set of design recommendations for improving the accessibility of voice assistants for older adults, promoting more equitable interaction experiences.
