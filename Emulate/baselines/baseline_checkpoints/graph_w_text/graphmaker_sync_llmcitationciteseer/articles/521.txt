Efficient task allocation in multi-agent systems is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to enable autonomous task allocation among agents. We introduce a decentralized framework, 'MARL-TA', that utilizes a combination of deep Q-networks and graph neural networks to learn optimal task assignments. Our approach considers agent capabilities, task dependencies, and environmental constraints, leading to improved system performance and adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MARL-TA in various scenarios, including search and rescue operations and warehouse automation.
