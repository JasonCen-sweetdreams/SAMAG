Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents SQL-Opt, a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and graph-based models to minimize query latency and improve resource utilization. SQL-Opt integrates with existing database management systems and can be easily extended to support various data distributions and query patterns. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that SQL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
