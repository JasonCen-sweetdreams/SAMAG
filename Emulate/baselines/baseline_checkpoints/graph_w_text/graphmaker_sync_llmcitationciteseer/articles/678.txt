Distributed query processing is a crucial component of modern data analytics, but optimizing join order remains a challenging problem. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically determine the optimal join order in distributed query processing. We propose a novel RL-based approach, 'Distributed Join Optimizer' (DJO), which learns to adapt to changing data distributions and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DJO outperforms traditional join order optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while achieving comparable accuracy.
