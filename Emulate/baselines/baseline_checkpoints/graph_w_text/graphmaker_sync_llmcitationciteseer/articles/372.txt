Short-text collections, such as tweets and product reviews, pose unique challenges for information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-ST', that leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and their variants to improve retrieval effectiveness. HQE-ST integrates a word-embedding-based semantic similarity measure with a hierarchical clustering algorithm to generate a set of expanded queries that better capture the user's information need. Experimental results on several short-text datasets demonstrate that HQE-ST outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly for short queries with limited context.
