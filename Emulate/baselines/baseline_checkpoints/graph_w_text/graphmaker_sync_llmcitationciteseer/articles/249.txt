This paper presents a study on the design of embodied avatars in virtual reality (VR) to enhance social presence and user engagement. We investigate the effects of avatar customizability, gesture recognition, and facial expression mirroring on users' sense of embodiment and social connection. Our results show that avatars with dynamic facial expressions and gestures lead to higher levels of social presence and user satisfaction compared to static avatars. We also find that customizability features, such as skin tone and clothing options, increase users' sense of ownership and agency. The findings have implications for the design of social VR experiences, virtual events, and remote collaboration platforms.
