Knowledge graph construction is a crucial task in information retrieval, but entity disambiguation remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph attention networks to disambiguate entities in knowledge graphs. Our method, called GAT-ED, learns to focus on relevant neighboring entities and contextual information to accurately resolve entity ambiguities. We evaluate GAT-ED on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving knowledge graph quality and reducing ambiguity. Our results show that GAT-ED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in entity disambiguation, especially in scenarios with limited training data.
