Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, have become ubiquitous in daily life. However, people with disabilities often face significant barriers when interacting with these systems. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for designing inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to diverse abilities and needs. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with disabilities, identifying key design recommendations for improving accessibility, usability, and user experience. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal input, adaptive feedback, and personalized accommodation. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a prototype system that integrates these design principles, showcasing improved performance and satisfaction for users with disabilities.
