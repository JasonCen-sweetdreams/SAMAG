Autonomous traffic management is a complex task that requires coordinating multiple agents with conflicting goals. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize the behavior of traffic lights and autonomous vehicles in a multi-agent setting. Our method, called 'TrafficMA', uses a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn coordinated policies that minimize congestion and reduce travel times. We evaluate TrafficMA in a simulated urban environment and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional traffic signal control methods.
