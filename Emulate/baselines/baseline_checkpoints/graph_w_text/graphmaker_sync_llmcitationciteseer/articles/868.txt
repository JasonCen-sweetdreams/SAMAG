Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but people with dyslexia often face significant barriers when interacting with these systems. This paper presents 'DyslexiaAware', a novel framework for designing accessible conversational interfaces tailored to the needs of individuals with dyslexia. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving co-design workshops and usability testing to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our results show that DyslexiaAware significantly improves interaction times, accuracy, and user satisfaction for participants with dyslexia, while also providing a more inclusive and user-friendly experience for all users.
