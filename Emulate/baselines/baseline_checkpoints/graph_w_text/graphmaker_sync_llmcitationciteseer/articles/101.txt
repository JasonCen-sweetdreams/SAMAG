Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly popular in various domains, including gaming, education, and healthcare. However, existing interfaces often neglect the diverse needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents an adaptive visualization framework, ' GestureVue', that dynamically adjusts visual feedback to accommodate individual users' abilities and preferences. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, including those with visual and motor impairments, to evaluate the effectiveness of GestureVue in improving interaction accuracy and user satisfaction. Our results show a significant reduction in errors and increased user confidence when using GestureVue, highlighting its potential for promoting inclusive interaction design.
