In modern search engines, query-dependent document expansion has been shown to improve retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing methods often rely on simplistic approaches, such as term frequency-based expansion, which may not capture the nuances of the query context. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document expansion framework, 'QADE', which leverages graph-based semantic modeling to identify relevant expansion terms. Our approach incorporates a query-dependent attention mechanism to weigh the importance of each expansion term, enabling more accurate and efficient retrieval. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that QADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision and a 20% reduction in retrieval time.
