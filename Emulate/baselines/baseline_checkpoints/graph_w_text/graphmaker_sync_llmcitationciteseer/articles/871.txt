Modern multi-core database systems often struggle with suboptimal index structures, leading to poor query performance. This paper proposes a novel self-optimizing index framework, 'AutoIndex', which adaptively reconfigures index structures based on runtime query patterns and system resource utilization. Our approach leverages machine learning-based prediction models to forecast query workloads and optimize index layouts for improved query efficiency. Experimental results on a real-world database benchmark demonstrate that AutoIndex achieves up to 3x query performance improvement compared to traditional static indexing techniques.
