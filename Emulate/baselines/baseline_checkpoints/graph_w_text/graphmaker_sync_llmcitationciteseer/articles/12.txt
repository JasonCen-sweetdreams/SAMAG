Medical information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to capture the nuances of complex medical queries, leading to inadequate search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to enhance the retrieval performance. We integrate domain-specific knowledge graphs, such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), with word embeddings to create a hybrid representation of medical concepts. Our experiments on a benchmark medical IR dataset demonstrate significant improvements in precision and recall compared to traditional query expansion techniques, showcasing the potential of knowledge graph-based methods for medical IR.
