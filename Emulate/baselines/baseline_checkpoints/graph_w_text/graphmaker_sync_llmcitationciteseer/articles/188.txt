Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly prevalent in modern data-intensive applications. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in DDS due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper presents a novel graph-based indexing approach, called GraphIX, which leverages the structural properties of data graphs to optimize query performance. GraphIX constructs a hierarchical index that captures the underlying graph structure, enabling efficient query routing and reducing communication overhead. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphIX achieves up to 3x improvement in query response time compared to existing indexing techniques.
