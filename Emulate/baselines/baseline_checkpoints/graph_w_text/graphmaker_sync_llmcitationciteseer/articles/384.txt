The increasing use of deep neural networks in safety-critical applications has raised concerns about their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect adversarial attacks using graph-based attention networks (GATs). Our method, called GAT-Det, leverages the graph structure of neural networks to identify suspicious patterns in the input data. We employ an attention mechanism to focus on the most critical neurons and edges in the network, enabling effective detection of adversarial examples. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the efficacy of GAT-Det in detecting various types of adversarial attacks, including those crafted using state-of-the-art attack algorithms.
