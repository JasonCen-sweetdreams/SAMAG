Passage retrieval is a crucial component in many natural language processing applications. While neural semantic models have shown promising results in passage ranking, they often struggle with lexical mismatch between the query and relevant passages. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'SemEx', which leverages the semantic representations generated by neural models to identify relevant terms for expansion. We introduce a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group semantically similar terms and select the most informative ones for expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemEx significantly improves the retrieval performance of neural passage retrieval models, especially when combined with a robust ranking framework.
