Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has become a popular paradigm for open-domain question answering, but its computational overhead hinders its applicability to large-scale datasets. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document expansion technique, 'QADE', which selectively expands relevant documents based on the query context. QADE leverages a learned query-document similarity metric to identify the most informative passages and dynamically adjusts the document representation. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that QADE reduces the computational cost of DPR by up to 40% while maintaining state-of-the-art retrieval performance.
