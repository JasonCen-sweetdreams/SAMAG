In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that affects the overall performance and efficiency of the system. This paper presents a novel approach to dynamic task allocation, where autonomous entities adapt to changing environmental conditions and task requirements. Our approach, called 'DyTAMA', uses a decentralized, auction-based mechanism to allocate tasks in real-time, taking into account the capabilities, preferences, and constraints of individual agents. Experimental results demonstrate that DyTAMA outperforms existing task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and system adaptability.
