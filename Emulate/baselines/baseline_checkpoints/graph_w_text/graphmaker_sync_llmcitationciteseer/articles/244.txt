Short text retrieval is a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with queries that lack context. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages contextualized embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms. We introduce a neural network-based model that fine-tunes pre-trained language models to generate query expansions that are sensitive to the specific context of the query. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, especially for short queries, and outperform traditional query expansion techniques.
