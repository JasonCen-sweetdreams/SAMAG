As graph databases continue to grow in size and complexity, optimizing query performance becomes increasingly critical. This paper presents a novel distributed query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', designed for scalable graph database systems. GraphOpt leverages a hierarchical decomposition of the graph structure to identify and prune redundant subqueries, reducing the communication overhead between nodes. We propose a cost-based optimization algorithm that adaptively adjusts the query plan based on runtime statistics and node availability. Experimental results on a large-scale graph dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt achieves up to 3x speedup compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
