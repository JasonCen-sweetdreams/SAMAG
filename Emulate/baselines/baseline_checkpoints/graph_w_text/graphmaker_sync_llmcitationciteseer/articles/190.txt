This paper addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma in multi-agent systems, where agents must balance individual learning with collective goal achievement. We propose a novel algorithm, Coordinated Thompson Sampling (CTS), which integrates Thompson sampling with a coordination mechanism that adaptively adjusts exploration rates based on agent interactions. CTS is shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in simulated robotic search and rescue scenarios, achieving higher cumulative rewards and faster convergence to optimal policies. Theoretical analysis provides insights into the algorithm's performance guarantees and convergence rates.
