Coordinating multiple agents to allocate resources efficiently is a challenging problem in various domains, including logistics, finance, and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'AgentDQN', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize resource allocation in multi-agent systems. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that combines centralized planning with decentralized execution, enabling agents to adapt to changing environments and learn from experience. Experimental results on a simulated resource allocation task demonstrate that AgentDQN outperforms traditional optimization methods and achieves significant improvements in resource utilization and system efficiency.
