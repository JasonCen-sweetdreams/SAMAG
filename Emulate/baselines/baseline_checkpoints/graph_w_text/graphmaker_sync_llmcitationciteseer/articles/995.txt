As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to understand how embodiment – the sense of owning a virtual body – affects human-robot collaboration in these environments. This paper presents a user study (N=30) examining the effects of embodiment on trust, fluency, and overall collaboration performance in a VR-based assembly task. We find that participants in the embodied condition exhibit higher trust and fluency in their robotic partners, leading to improved task completion times and reduced errors. Our results have significant implications for the design of VR-based collaborative systems and highlight the importance of considering embodiment in human-robot interaction.
