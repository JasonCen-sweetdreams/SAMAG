Session-based search tasks, where users interact with a search engine through multiple queries, pose significant challenges for traditional retrieval models. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE', that leverages both short-term and long-term dependencies within a search session. Our approach integrates topic modeling and word embeddings to generate contextualized expansion terms, which are then weighted using a session-aware relevance scoring function. Experimental results on the TREC Session Track dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving significant improvements in session-level retrieval metrics.
