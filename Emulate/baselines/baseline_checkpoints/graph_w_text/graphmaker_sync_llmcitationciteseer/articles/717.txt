Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or underspecified queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages context-aware neural embeddings to capture nuanced query semantics. By incorporating a dual-encoder architecture that jointly models query and document representations, CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art expansion techniques on several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval performance for diverse query types, including entity-based and event-based queries.
