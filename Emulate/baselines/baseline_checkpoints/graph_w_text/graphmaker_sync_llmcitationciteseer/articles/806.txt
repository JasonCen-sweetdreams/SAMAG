Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessible and usable interfaces for diverse user populations. This paper presents a novel framework for designing adaptive feedback mechanisms in VR systems, focusing on users with disabilities. Our approach leverages machine learning-based user modeling and real-time adaptation to provide personalized feedback, ensuring an inclusive and engaging VR experience. We evaluate our framework through a user study with participants with visual impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
