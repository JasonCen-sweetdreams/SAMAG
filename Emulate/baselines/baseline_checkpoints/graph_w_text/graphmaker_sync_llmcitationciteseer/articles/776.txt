Distributed graph databases (DGDs) are increasingly used to store and query large-scale graph data. However, query optimization in DGDs is challenging due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization, query rewriting, and cost-based optimization to improve query performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphOpt on a real-world social network dataset, showing significant improvements in query response times and scalability compared to existing optimization techniques.
