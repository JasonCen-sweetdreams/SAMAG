Short-text search queries often lack sufficient context, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that combines word embeddings with graph-based methods to capture nuanced semantic relationships. We introduce a graph-based framework that leverages word co-occurrence patterns to identify relevant expansion terms, which are then re-weighted using contextualized embeddings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall.
