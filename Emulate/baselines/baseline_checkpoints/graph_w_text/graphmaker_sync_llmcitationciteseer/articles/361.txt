Virtual assistants (VAs) have the potential to improve the daily lives of people with disabilities, but their lack of emotional intelligence can lead to frustration and abandonment. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an emotionally intelligent VA, 'EmpathBot', which incorporates affective computing and adaptive dialogue management to provide personalized support. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with disabilities, showing that EmpathBot significantly outperformed a standard VA in terms of user satisfaction, trust, and perceived empathy. Our results highlight the importance of emotionally intelligent VAs in promoting inclusive and accessible HCI.
