Explainability is a crucial aspect of trustworthy AI systems, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL) where agents make sequential decisions. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based framework, 'HATRL', that provides interpretable explanations for RL policies. Our approach incorporates both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to identify relevant state features and action influences. We evaluate HATRL on several benchmark environments, demonstrating improved transparency and fidelity of explanations compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we show that HATRL enables more effective human-AI collaboration and policy adaptation in complex decision-making scenarios.
