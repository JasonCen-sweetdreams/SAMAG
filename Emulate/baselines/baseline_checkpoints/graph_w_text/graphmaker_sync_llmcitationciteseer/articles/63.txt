The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of time-series data, necessitating efficient query optimization techniques for real-time analytics. This paper presents 'Ripple', a novel distributed query optimization framework that leverages a hierarchical clustering approach to partition and process IoT-generated time-series data in parallel. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts the degree of parallelism and data pruning to minimize query latency and maximize resource utilization. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that Ripple achieves up to 5x speedup over traditional query optimization techniques while maintaining high accuracy.
