Knowledge graph-based retrieval has gained popularity in recent years, but existing methods often struggle to effectively model complex entity relationships. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages hierarchical entity embeddings to capture nuanced semantic dependencies between entities. Our method, called HierExpan, represents entities as hierarchical vectors that encapsulate their relationships at multiple levels of abstraction. We demonstrate that HierExpan significantly improves retrieval performance on several benchmark datasets, particularly for queries involving entities with ambiguous or polysemous meanings.
