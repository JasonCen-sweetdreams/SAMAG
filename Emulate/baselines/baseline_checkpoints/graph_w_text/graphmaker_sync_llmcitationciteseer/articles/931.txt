Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis, but its application to high-dimensional data is hindered by scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel approach, Deep Embedded Forests (DEF), which leverages the strength of deep learning and random forests to efficiently cluster high-dimensional data. DEF uses a deep autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional representation of the data, followed by a random forest-based clustering algorithm that exploits the hierarchical structure of the data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DEF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency.
