This paper addresses the problem of coordinating autonomous agents in smart city traffic management. We propose a distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) framework that enables agents to make decentralized decisions while ensuring global constraints are satisfied. Our approach leverages a novel, anytime algorithm that adaptively adjusts the level of decentralization based on the network's communication topology and constraint dynamics. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network show that our approach outperforms existing centralized and decentralized methods in terms of travel time reduction and network throughput.
