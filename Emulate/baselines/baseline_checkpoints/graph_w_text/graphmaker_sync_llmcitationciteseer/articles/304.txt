Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and throughput. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning. We propose an agent-based framework, 'QLearn', that leverages a hybrid neural network architecture to learn optimal query plans for complex queries. Our experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that QLearn outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of execution time, while also adapting to changing workload patterns.
