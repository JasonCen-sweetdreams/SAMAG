Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Existing optimization techniques often rely on simplistic cost models or exhaustive enumeration, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper presents a novel adaptive sampling approach, 'AdaSample', which leverages machine learning to estimate query costs and dynamically adjusts sampling rates to minimize optimization overhead. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate that AdaSample outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques, achieving up to 30% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in optimization overhead.
