This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent system for autonomous traffic management, where agents representing individual vehicles or traffic signals cooperate to optimize traffic flow. We introduce a novel negotiation protocol that enables agents to dynamically adjust their behavior in response to changing traffic conditions, while respecting constraints imposed by traffic infrastructure and safety regulations. Our approach is evaluated using real-world traffic data and simulations, demonstrating improved traffic throughput and reduced congestion compared to traditional centralized traffic management systems.
