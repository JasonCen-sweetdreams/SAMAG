Gesture-based text entry on touchscreens is becoming increasingly popular, but traditional keyboard layouts are not optimized for this input modality. This paper presents a novel approach to designing adaptive keyboard layouts that dynamically adjust to an individual's gesture patterns and typing habits. We propose a machine learning model that leverages user data to optimize key placement, size, and spacing, resulting in improved typing accuracy and speed. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that our adaptive layout outperforms traditional QWERTY and alphabetical layouts by 15% and 25%, respectively, in terms of typing speed and accuracy.
