Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by accessibility limitations. This paper introduces InvisibleButtons, a novel system that enables users with visual impairments to interact with virtual objects more effectively. Our approach combines tactile feedback and gesture recognition to provide an intuitive and accurate way of selecting objects in VR. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, which showed that InvisibleButtons reduces the interaction time by 35% and improves the overall user experience compared to traditional methods.
