Traditional query-document similarity measurement methods in Information Retrieval (IR) rely on handcrafted features and shallow learning techniques, which may not capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture, 'DeepSim', which learns hierarchical representations of queries and documents from large-scale clickthrough data. We demonstrate that DeepSim outperforms state-of-the-art IR models on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the learned representations and provide insights into the semantic patterns captured by DeepSim.
