Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel neural query graph embedding (NQGE) framework that learns to represent user queries as dense vectors in a semantic space. By incorporating query graph features, our approach effectively captures query relationships and contextual dependencies. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that NQGE-based query expansion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision. Our approach has significant implications for improving the effectiveness of ad-hoc retrieval systems.
