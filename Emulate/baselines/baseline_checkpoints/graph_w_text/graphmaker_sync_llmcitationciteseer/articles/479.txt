Proximity search is a fundamental operation in many information retrieval applications, but its performance degrades significantly in high-dimensional spaces. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'HD-Prox', which leverages a combination of hierarchical clustering and compact binary codes to efficiently search for nearest neighbors. Our approach reduces the number of distance computations by up to 90% compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining a high recall rate. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HD-Prox in various IR applications, including image and text retrieval.
