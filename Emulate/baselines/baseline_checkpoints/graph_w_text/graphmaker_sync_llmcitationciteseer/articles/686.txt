Traditional query expansion methods for document retrieval rely on term co-occurrence statistics, which can be limited by the quality of the underlying document collection. We propose a novel approach that leverages pre-trained word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, called EmbedEx, uses a combination of term similarity and document frequency to select expansion terms that are both semantically relevant and discriminative. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmbedEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
