Efficient traffic management is crucial for reducing congestion and improving safety in urban areas. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'TrafficMaster', which enables autonomous agents to learn decentralized traffic control policies in real-time. We introduce a hierarchical graph neural network architecture that captures complex traffic patterns and adapts to changing traffic conditions. Experimental results on a large-scale traffic simulation dataset demonstrate that TrafficMaster outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of reduced travel times and increased network throughput.
