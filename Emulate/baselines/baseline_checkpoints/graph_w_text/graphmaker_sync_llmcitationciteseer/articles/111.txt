Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices generate vast amounts of time-series data, making anomaly detection crucial for ensuring system reliability and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that captures complex temporal patterns and relationships in IIoT data. Our approach leverages multi-scale attention mechanisms to focus on relevant features and time intervals, improving detection accuracy and reducing false positives. Experimental results on a real-world IIoT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies in industrial equipment and outperforming state-of-the-art baseline methods.
