Negotiation is a crucial aspect of multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents must reach mutually beneficial agreements in complex, dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'AgentNegotiator', which enables agents to learn effective negotiation strategies through self-play. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that integrates game-theoretic models with deep neural networks, allowing agents to adapt to changing opponent behaviors and negotiate in a more human-like manner. Experimental results on a real-world supply chain management scenario demonstrate that AgentNegotiator outperforms traditional negotiation protocols in terms of agreement quality, negotiation speed, and robustness to opponent strategies.
