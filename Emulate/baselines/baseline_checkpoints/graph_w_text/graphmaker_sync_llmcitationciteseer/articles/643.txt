In IoT networks, efficient task allocation is crucial for optimizing resource utilization and reducing latency. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for distributed task allocation in IoT networks. We propose a decentralized, asynchronous learning approach that enables agents to learn from local observations and adapt to dynamic network conditions. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization. We also analyze the impact of agent communication topology on learning convergence and allocation performance.
