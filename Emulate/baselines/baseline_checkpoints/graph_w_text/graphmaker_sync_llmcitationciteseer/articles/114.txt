Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-robot collaboration (HRC) by providing a shared, immersive environment for humans and robots to interact. However, the role of embodiment in VR-based HRC remains largely unexplored. This study investigates how different levels of embodiment in VR affect human trust, communication, and task performance in HRC. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, who collaborated with a robot in a virtual furniture assembly task. Our results show that higher levels of embodiment lead to increased trust and more effective communication, resulting in improved task performance. These findings have implications for the design of VR-based HRC systems that can facilitate more effective human-robot collaboration.
