Fake news detection is a critical task in natural language processing, but existing approaches often rely on complex models with limited interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) architecture that leverages graph-based representations of news articles and user interactions. Our model incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple levels to identify relevant features and relations, enabling interpretable explanations for fake news detection. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while providing insights into the decision-making process.
