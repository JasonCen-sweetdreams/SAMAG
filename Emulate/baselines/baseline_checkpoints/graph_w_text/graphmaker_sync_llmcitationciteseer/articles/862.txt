Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) has gained significant attention in recent years. However, the design of neural architectures for MER remains largely manual and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework, 'MERA', which leverages a hierarchical search space and a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to efficiently discover high-performing architectures for MER. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MERA on two benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing the search time by an order of magnitude compared to existing NAS methods.
