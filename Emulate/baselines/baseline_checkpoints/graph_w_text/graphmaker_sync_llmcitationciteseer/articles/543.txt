In multi-agent systems, decentralized negotiation mechanisms are crucial for agents to reach mutually beneficial agreements. This paper proposes a novel negotiation protocol, 'Distributed-ACOPF', which leverages approximation algorithms for solving the Asymmetric Connected Oriented Preferences Framework (ACOPF) problem. We develop a distributed negotiation mechanism that enables agents to iteratively exchange proposals and counter-proposals, converging to a Pareto-optimal agreement. Experimental results on a supply chain management scenario demonstrate that Distributed-ACOPF outperforms existing decentralized negotiation protocols in terms of negotiation efficiency and agreement quality.
