Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education and training, but high cognitive loads can lead to user fatigue and decreased performance. This paper presents 'GazeCue', a novel gaze-based interface that detects and adapts to users' cognitive load in real-time. By leveraging machine learning models and eye-tracking technology, GazeCue provides personalized feedback and guidance to reduce cognitive overload, improving overall user experience and task performance. Our user study demonstrates significant reductions in cognitive load and error rates, highlighting the potential of GazeCue to enhance VR-based learning and training applications.
