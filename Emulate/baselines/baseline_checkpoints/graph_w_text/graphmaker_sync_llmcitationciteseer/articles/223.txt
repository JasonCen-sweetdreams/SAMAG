SQL injection attacks remain a significant threat to database security, with traditional detection methods often relying on rule-based approaches that can be evaded by sophisticated attackers. This paper presents SQLShield, a novel deep learning-based framework for detecting SQL injection attacks in real-time. We propose a hybrid model that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to analyze SQL query patterns and identify malicious intent. Evaluations on a large dataset of SQL queries demonstrate that SQLShield achieves an accuracy of 97.5% and outperforms existing detection methods, with a significant reduction in false positives and false negatives.
