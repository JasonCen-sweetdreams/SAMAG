As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding how humans interact with agents in these environments is crucial. This study investigates the effect of embodiment on human-agent collaboration in VR, focusing on the role of anthropomorphic agents. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, analyzing their behavior and performance when working with embodied and non-embodied agents. Our results show that embodied agents lead to increased trust, communication, and task success, but also higher cognitive load. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of future human-agent collaboration systems in VR.
