Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to capture complex relationships between entities. However, existing KGE methods struggle to effectively model multi-relational graphs, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) for KGE, which leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant relational patterns. We evaluate HGAN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art KGE methods, achieving significant improvements in link prediction and entity classification tasks.
