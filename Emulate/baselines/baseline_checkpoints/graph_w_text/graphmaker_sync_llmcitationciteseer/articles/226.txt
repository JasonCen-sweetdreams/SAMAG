Object detection in open-world scenarios poses significant challenges, particularly when encountering unseen classes. This paper presents a novel zero-shot learning approach, 'GraphZSL', which leverages graph-based knowledge graph embeddings to learn a universal detector. By modeling relationships between classes as a graph, we can efficiently propagate knowledge from seen to unseen classes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating improved detection accuracy and robustness in open-world settings.
