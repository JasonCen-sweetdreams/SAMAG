As robots become increasingly prevalent in industrial environments, effective human-robot collaboration is crucial for productivity and safety. This study explores the role of embodiment in shaping human trust and behavior in human-robot teams. We conducted a series of experiments using a robotic arm and a virtual reality platform, manipulating the level of embodiment and task complexity. Our results show that increased embodiment leads to higher trust and more efficient collaboration, but only in simple tasks. In complex tasks, the benefits of embodiment are diminished. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of human-robot collaboration systems and future research directions.
