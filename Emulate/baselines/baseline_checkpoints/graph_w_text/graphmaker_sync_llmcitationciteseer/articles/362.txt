Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and system heterogeneity. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'OptiDist', which leverages machine learning and graph-based techniques to efficiently optimize queries in DDS. We propose a hierarchical query representation model that captures data distribution and system constraints, and develop a reinforcement learning-based optimizer that adaptively selects the best query plan. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that OptiDist achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance and 2x reduction in optimization time compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
