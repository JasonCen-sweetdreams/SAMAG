Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. We propose a novel approach, HierDPR, which leverages hierarchical dense representations to model document passages at multiple granularities. Our method first represents each passage as a hierarchical structure of dense vectors, capturing local and global semantic cues. Then, we employ a neural retrieval model to compute similarities between the question and passage representations. Experimental results on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that HierDPR significantly outperforms existing passage retrieval methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and downstream QA performance.
