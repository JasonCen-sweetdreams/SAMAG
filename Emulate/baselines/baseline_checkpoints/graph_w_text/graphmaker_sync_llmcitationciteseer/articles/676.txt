This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and resources need to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a decentralized auction-based mechanism that enables agents to bid for tasks based on their estimated costs and capabilities. Our approach leverages a novel auction protocol that ensures truthfulness, individual rationality, and Pareto optimality. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient task allocation and improved system performance compared to centralized and heuristic-based methods.
