Autonomous traffic management is a complex problem that requires coordinating multiple agents to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. This paper proposes a decentralized reinforcement learning framework for multi-agent systems, where each agent learns to make decisions based on local observations and communicates with neighboring agents to achieve global optimality. We introduce a novel graph-based attention mechanism that enables agents to selectively focus on relevant neighbors and adapt to changing traffic patterns. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized optimization methods and achieves significant reductions in travel time and congestion.
