The proliferation of multi-modal data has led to a surge in the demand for efficient retrieval systems. Existing indexing techniques, however, are often tailored to specific data types, resulting in suboptimal performance when applied to mixed-modal datasets. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing framework, 'MM-HI', which seamlessly integrates inverted indexing and hierarchical clustering to facilitate fast and accurate retrieval of multi-modal data. Our comprehensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset demonstrates that MM-HI outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 30% in terms of query latency while maintaining high retrieval accuracy.
