Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in enhancing learning outcomes, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR-based learning environments. We designed and implemented a VR system that generates avatars tailored to individual users' preferences and characteristics. Our user study involving 120 participants reveals that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, self-efficacy, and learning satisfaction. We also identify key design factors influencing avatar personalization and provide recommendations for future VR-based learning systems.
