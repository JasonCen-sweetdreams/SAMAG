The proliferation of voice-based interfaces has transformed human-computer interaction, but individuals with cognitive impairments, such as older adults, often struggle to effectively utilize these systems. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive voice-based interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, resulting in the development of a novel interface framework that incorporates cognitive support, error tolerance, and personalized feedback. Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice-based interfaces.
