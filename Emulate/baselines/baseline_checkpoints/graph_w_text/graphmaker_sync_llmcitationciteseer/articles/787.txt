Neural search engines have revolutionized information retrieval, but their effectiveness is often hindered by limited query representation. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'ContrastiveQE', which leverages contrastive learning to generate high-quality expansion terms. By training a neural network to differentiate between relevant and non-relevant documents, ContrastiveQE learns to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and expanded terms. Our experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods by up to 12% in terms of MAP.
