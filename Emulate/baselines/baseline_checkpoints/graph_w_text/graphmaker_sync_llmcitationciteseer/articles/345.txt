This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging auction-based mechanisms to efficiently assign tasks to agents. Our approach, called 'AuctionMAS', utilizes a hierarchical auction protocol to facilitate task allocation, ensuring that agents are assigned tasks that maximize their utility while minimizing overall system latency. We present a comprehensive evaluation of AuctionMAS using a variety of task allocation scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in system throughput and agent utilization compared to existing approaches.
