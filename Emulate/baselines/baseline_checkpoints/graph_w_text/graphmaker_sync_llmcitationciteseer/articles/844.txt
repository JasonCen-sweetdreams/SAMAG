Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, but traditional methods often rely on manual input or simplistic term co-occurrence analysis. This paper proposes a novel neural graph-based approach, 'TermGraph', which learns dense term embeddings from a large-scale knowledge graph. By incorporating graph attention mechanisms, TermGraph captures complex semantic relationships between terms and enables more effective query expansion. Experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
