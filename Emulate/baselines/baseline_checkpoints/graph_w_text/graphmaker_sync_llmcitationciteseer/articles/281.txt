Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the quality of life for people with disabilities, but existing VR systems often neglect the needs of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for individuals with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with individuals with disabilities and developed a set of guidelines and tools for designers to create accessible VR applications. Our evaluation study with 20 participants with disabilities demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving their VR experience and enhancing their sense of presence and engagement.
