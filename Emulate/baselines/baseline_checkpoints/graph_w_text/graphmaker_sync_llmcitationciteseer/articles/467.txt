Coordinating the actions of multiple agents in dynamic environments is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that enables effective cooperation among agents by learning to represent and reason about their interactions. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between agents and their environment, and hierarchical representations to capture both local and global dependencies. Experimental results on a suite of multi-agent scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of HGAT compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles and smart cities.
