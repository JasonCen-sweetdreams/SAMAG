Voice assistants have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but their adoption among older adults with impaired dexterity is hindered by inaccessible interfaces. This study investigates the design of inclusive voice assistants that accommodate the needs of this demographic. We conducted a participatory design process with 15 older adults, revealing key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed design, 'EasyVoice', incorporates adaptive speech recognition, personalized command sets, and multimodal feedback. A user study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for designers and developers of voice assistants to create more inclusive and supportive systems for older adults.
