Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including IoT monitoring and financial forecasting. However, existing methods struggle with high-dimensional data and limited labeled samples. This paper presents 'GraphCon', a novel approach that leverages graph-based contrastive learning to identify anomalies in time-series data. By constructing a graph from the time-series data and applying contrastive learning, GraphCon learns robust representations that capture complex patterns and relationships. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate GraphCon's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in F1-score and 20% in AUC-ROC.
