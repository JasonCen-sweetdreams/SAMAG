 Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the quality of life for elderly individuals with motor impairments. However, existing systems often struggle to accurately recognize gestures performed by users with limited mobility or coordination. This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive gesture recognition, which incorporates machine learning models that learn to recognize gestures from a small set of user-specific examples. We evaluate our approach using a custom-built dataset of gestures performed by elderly users with motor impairments and demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches.
