Knowledge graphs have become a cornerstone of modern information systems, but querying these massive datasets remains a significant challenge. This paper presents HQE, a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages semantic relationships between entities to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of semantic search. By adaptively expanding queries using a combination of entity embeddings and hierarchical clustering, HQE reduces the search space and retrieves more relevant results. Experiments on the YAGO2 and DBpedia datasets demonstrate HQE's superiority over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, with significant gains in precision and recall.
