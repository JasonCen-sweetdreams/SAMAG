Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing personalized support and therapy. However, existing ECAs often neglect the needs of individuals with disabilities. This paper presents a novel ECA framework, 'IncluBot', which integrates multimodal interaction capabilities to facilitate inclusive healthcare. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, including individuals with visual and hearing impairments, to evaluate the effectiveness of IncluBot in promoting engagement and trust. Our results show that IncluBot outperforms traditional text-based agents in terms of user satisfaction and perceived empathy.
