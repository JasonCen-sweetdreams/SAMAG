This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to design more intuitive and engaging user interfaces. We present a gesture-based interface framework that leverages the cognitive benefits of bodily interactions to improve user experience in VR. Our user study involving 30 participants shows that embodied interfaces lead to enhanced spatial awareness, reduced cognitive load, and increased user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems and highlight avenues for further research.
