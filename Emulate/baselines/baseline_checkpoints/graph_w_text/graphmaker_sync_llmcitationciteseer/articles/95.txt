Knowledge graph (KG) relation prediction has become a crucial task in various applications, including question answering and recommendation systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) model for relation prediction in KGs. HGAT leverages multi-hop neighborhood information and hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture complex relational patterns. We evaluate HGAT on three benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of Hits@1 and MRR metrics. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of the learned attention weights, revealing the importance of hierarchical information in KG relation prediction.
