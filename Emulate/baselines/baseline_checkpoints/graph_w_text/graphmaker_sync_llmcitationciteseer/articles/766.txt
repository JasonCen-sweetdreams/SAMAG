Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but individuals with visual impairments often face significant barriers to accessing these experiences. This paper presents a novel, inclusive VR interface design framework that leverages multimodal sensory substitution and audio-based navigation to enable visually impaired users to engage with VR environments. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through a user study with 20 visually impaired participants, demonstrating improved navigation performance and user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-based interfaces.
