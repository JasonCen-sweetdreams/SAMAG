Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, where the goal is to reformulate the original query to better capture the user's information need. Traditional methods rely on heuristics or manual feature engineering, which often lead to suboptimal performance. We propose a novel approach that formulates query expansion as a sequential decision-making problem and employs reinforcement learning to optimize the expansion process. Our method, 'RL-EXPAND', learns to select the most effective expansion terms by maximizing a reward function that balances retrieval effectiveness and query coherence. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
