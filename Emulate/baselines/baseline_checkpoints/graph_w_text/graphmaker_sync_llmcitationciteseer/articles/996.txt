Time-series data is increasingly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can have devastating consequences in applications like finance and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect such attacks using Graph Attention Networks (GATs). We model time-series data as a graph, where each node represents a timestamp, and edges capture temporal dependencies. Our GAT-based detector learns to identify anomalous patterns indicative of attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world scenarios, including stock market and ECG signal analysis.
