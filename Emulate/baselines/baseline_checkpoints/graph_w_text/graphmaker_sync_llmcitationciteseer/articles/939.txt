Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or under-specified queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, dubbed 'RL-Expan', learns to iteratively expand the query by selecting relevant terms from a large vocabulary, guided by a reward function that balances retrieval effectiveness and query coherence. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-Expan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
