Few-shot node classification in graph-structured data is a challenging task, particularly when limited labeled data is available. This paper introduces Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Networks (HAGNN), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical graph attention mechanisms to adapt to new classes. HAGNN combines node-level and graph-level attention to capture both local and global structural patterns, enabling effective few-shot learning. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 15% improvement in accuracy on 5-shot node classification tasks.
