Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, but manual feature engineering can be time-consuming and suboptimal. This paper introduces 'GrafAnom', a novel framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to automatically extract relevant features from time-series data. We propose a hierarchical graph representation that captures both local and global patterns in the data, and a GNN-based feature learning module that generates a set of discriminative features for anomaly detection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GrafAnom outperforms state-of-the-art methods while reducing the need for manual feature engineering.
