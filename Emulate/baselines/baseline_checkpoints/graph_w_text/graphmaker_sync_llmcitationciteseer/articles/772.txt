Multi-agent pathfinding is a challenging problem in AI research, particularly in domains with complex spatial constraints. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with hierarchical planning to efficiently compute collision-free paths for multiple agents. Our method, 'HGN-Path', leverages GNNs to learn a hierarchical representation of the environment, which is then used to guide a hierarchical planning algorithm. Experimental results on various multi-agent scenarios demonstrate that HGN-Path outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
