Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with long documents and nuanced queries. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach, Hierarchical Relevance Embeddings (HRE), which captures both local and global semantic relationships within documents to improve relevance ranking. HRE employs a hierarchical document encoder that generates embeddings at multiple granularities, which are then used to compute relevance scores with respect to the query. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that HRE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including BERT-based models, and achieves significant improvements in terms of nDCG and ERR metrics.
