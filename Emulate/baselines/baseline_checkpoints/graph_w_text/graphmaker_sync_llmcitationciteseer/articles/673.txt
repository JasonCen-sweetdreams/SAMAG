Distributed database systems face the challenge of optimizing query execution plans in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our framework, 'RL-QOpt', learns to select optimal query plans based on feedback from the database system and adapts to changes in data distribution, query patterns, and system workload. Experimental results on a distributed database benchmark demonstrate that RL-QOpt achieves significant performance improvements over traditional optimization techniques, with an average reduction of 30% in query execution time.
