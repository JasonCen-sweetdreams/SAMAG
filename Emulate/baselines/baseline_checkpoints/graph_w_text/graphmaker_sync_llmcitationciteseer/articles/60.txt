In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using adaptive auction mechanisms, which enables agents to dynamically adjust their bidding strategies based on real-time feedback. We introduce a novel auction protocol that incorporates a reinforcement learning component to optimize task allocation and minimize communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency, while maintaining scalability and robustness in dynamic environments.
