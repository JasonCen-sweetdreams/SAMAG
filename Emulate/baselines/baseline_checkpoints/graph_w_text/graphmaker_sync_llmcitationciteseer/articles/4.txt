Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but existing avatar designs often fail to engage users. This paper presents a novel framework for generating personalized avatars that incorporate users' personality traits, preferences, and behavior. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, using a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the impact of our avatar design on user experience. Results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, improved self-representation, and enhanced emotional expression in VR environments.
