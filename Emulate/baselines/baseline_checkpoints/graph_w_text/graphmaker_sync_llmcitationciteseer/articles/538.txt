Neural search engines have shown promising results in capturing semantic relationships between queries and documents. However, they often struggle with out-of-vocabulary words and limited domain knowledge. This paper proposes a novel query expansion technique, 'SemEx', which leverages pre-trained semantic embeddings to generate contextualized expansion terms. We demonstrate that SemEx can improve the retrieval performance of neural search engines by up to 15% on several benchmark datasets, while reducing the computational overhead by 30% compared to traditional query expansion methods.
