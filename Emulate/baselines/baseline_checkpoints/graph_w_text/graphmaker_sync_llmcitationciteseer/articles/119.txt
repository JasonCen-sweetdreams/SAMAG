Virtual assistants (VAs) are increasingly integrated into daily life, but their anthropomorphic design can influence user trust. This study investigates how VA design features, such as facial expressions and tone of voice, affect user trust and perceived reliability. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants, who interacted with a VA in a controlled environment. Results show that VAs with more human-like features were perceived as more trustworthy, but this effect was mitigated when the VA made mistakes. Our findings have implications for the design of VAs in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare and finance.
