Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for older adults remains a concern. This paper presents an embodied cognition-inspired design framework for creating inclusive conversational interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+, exploring the effects of anthropomorphic agents, spatial memory cues, and multimodal feedback on their engagement and comprehension. Our findings suggest that incorporating embodied cognition principles can significantly improve older adults' interaction experience and reduce cognitive load. We provide design guidelines and implications for future research.
