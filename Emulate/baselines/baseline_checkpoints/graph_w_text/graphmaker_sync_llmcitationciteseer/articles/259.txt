Virtual reality (VR) has been increasingly used for motor skill learning, but the impact of personalized visual feedback on learning outcomes remains understudied. This paper presents a user study that investigates the effect of tailored visual feedback on motor skill acquisition in a VR-based golf swing training system. We developed a machine learning model that analyzes user performance and generates customized feedback in real-time. Our results show that participants who received personalized visual feedback demonstrated significant improvements in swing accuracy and consistency compared to those who received standardized feedback. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR-based training systems and highlight avenues for future research.
