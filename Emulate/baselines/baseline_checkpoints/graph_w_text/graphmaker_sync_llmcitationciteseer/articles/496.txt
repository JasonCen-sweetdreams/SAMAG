Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a crucial component in various AI applications, but entity disambiguation remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GEDIS', which leverages graph-based embeddings to disambiguate entities in large-scale KGs. By incorporating structural and semantic information from KGs, GEDIS learns to represent entities as dense vectors, enabling efficient disambiguation. Experimental results on popular KG benchmarks demonstrate that GEDIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, while scaling to large datasets.
