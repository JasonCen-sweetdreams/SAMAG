Real-time data warehousing requires efficient query optimization to handle massive data volumes and high query arrival rates. This paper presents 'DeepQOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to dynamically adapt to changing workload patterns. Our approach uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn an optimal query plan selection policy, taking into account query latency, data freshness, and system resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world data warehousing benchmark show that DeepQOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of system throughput.
