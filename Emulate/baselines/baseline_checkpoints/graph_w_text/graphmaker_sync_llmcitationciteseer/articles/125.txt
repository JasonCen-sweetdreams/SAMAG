Time series forecasting has numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and energy management. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their lack of interpretability hinders trust and adoption. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAT) architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to selectively focus on relevant input features and time steps. Our approach provides feature attribution and temporal importance scores, enabling explanations for forecasted values. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate HAT's competitive performance and improved interpretability compared to existing time series forecasting methods.
