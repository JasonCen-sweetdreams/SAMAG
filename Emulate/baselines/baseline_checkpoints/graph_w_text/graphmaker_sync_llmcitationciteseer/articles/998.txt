Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly popular, but they often exclude older adults with motor impairments. This paper presents a novel inclusive design approach, 'EasyGesture', which incorporates compensatory strategies and adaptive feedback mechanisms to facilitate gesture recognition for this user group. We conducted a user study with 20 older adults with motor impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional gesture-based interfaces. Our findings inform the development of more accessible and usable gesture-based systems for older adults.
