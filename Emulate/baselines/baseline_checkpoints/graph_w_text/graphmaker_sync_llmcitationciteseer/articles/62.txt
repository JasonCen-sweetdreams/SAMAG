This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing gestural interfaces that cater to older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with Parkinson's disease, stroke, or arthritis, and analyzed their motor abilities, gesture preferences, and feedback. Our findings inform the development of 'EasyGest', a novel gestural interface that incorporates adaptable gesture recognition, personalized feedback, and error tolerance. A usability evaluation with 15 participants demonstrates that EasyGest significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing interfaces.
