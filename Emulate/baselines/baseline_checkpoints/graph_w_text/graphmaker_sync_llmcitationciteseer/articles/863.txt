Distributed information retrieval systems face challenges in scaling query processing while maintaining search efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE', which leverages semantic relationships between query terms to reduce the search space. HQE adaptively selects relevant expansion terms based on the query context and document collection statistics. Experimental results on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms existing query expansion techniques in terms of search efficiency, precision, and recall, while reducing the average query processing time by 35%.
