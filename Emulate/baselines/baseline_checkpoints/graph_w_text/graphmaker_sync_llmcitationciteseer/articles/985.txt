Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) is a popular technique for achieving high concurrency in distributed databases. However, it can lead to complex query optimization challenges due to the presence of multiple versions of data. This paper presents a novel query optimization algorithm, 'MVCC-Opt', that leverages a combination of static and dynamic analysis to minimize the number of version checks and reduce query latency. Our experimental evaluation on a distributed database benchmark shows that MVCC-Opt outperforms existing approaches by up to 30% in terms of query throughput and 25% in terms of latency.
