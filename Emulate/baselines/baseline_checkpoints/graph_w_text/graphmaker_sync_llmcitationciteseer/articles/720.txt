This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent pathfinding, a crucial problem in autonomous systems, video games, and robotic navigation. We introduce 'DynaPart', a scalable algorithm that leverages dynamic graph partitioning to efficiently compute collision-free paths for hundreds of agents in complex environments. DynaPart combines a hierarchical graph decomposition with a distributed auction-based method to allocate paths, achieving a significant reduction in computation time and memory usage compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on various benchmark scenarios demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach.
