In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. However, the lack of transparency in these interactions hinders trust and understanding. We introduce Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs), a novel deep learning approach that learns to explain multi-agent decision-making processes. HANs employ a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant agent interactions, generating interpretable explanations for the collective decision. Our experiments on a synthetic traffic management scenario demonstrate that HANs outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of decision accuracy while providing insights into the decision-making process.
