Coordinating multiple autonomous robots to achieve complex tasks is a fundamental challenge in robotics. This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HORSE', that enables effective coordination among agents in multi-robot systems. HORSE decomposes the coordination problem into two levels: high-level task allocation and low-level motion planning. We demonstrate that HORSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simulations of a warehouse automation scenario, achieving higher task completion rates and reduced collisions. Our approach has significant implications for real-world applications such as search and rescue, warehouse logistics, and environmental monitoring.
