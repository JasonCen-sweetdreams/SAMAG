Coordinating multiple agents in complex environments is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. This paper introduces a novel approach using hierarchical graph attention networks (HGAT) to learn effective coordination strategies. Our method represents agents and their interactions as a hierarchical graph, which is processed by a stack of graph attention layers to produce a coordinated action policy. Experimental results demonstrate that HGAT outperforms existing approaches in several multi-agent coordination tasks, including robot soccer and traffic management.
