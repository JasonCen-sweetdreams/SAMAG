Column-store databases have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to efficiently process analytical queries. However, modern multi-core architectures pose significant challenges in optimizing query execution. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'CORE', which leverages a combination of dynamic reordering, parallel execution, and cache-aware optimization techniques. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that CORE achieves significant performance improvements, up to 3.5x, compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers on multi-core systems.
