Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. Existing approaches often rely on hand-crafted heuristics or exhaustive search, leading to suboptimal query plans. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to learn effective optimization strategies. We design a reward function that balances query execution time, resource utilization, and data consistency, and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan generation policy. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and scalability compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
