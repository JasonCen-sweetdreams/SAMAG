As the global population ages, there is a growing need to design accessible smart home systems that cater to the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered study on the design of voice-controlled interfaces for smart home systems, focusing on the accessibility requirements of older adults. We conducted a series of usability tests with 20 older adults, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a set of design guidelines for accessible voice-controlled interfaces, which we evaluate through a prototype implementation. The results demonstrate significant improvements in usability and user satisfaction among older adults.
