Node classification in multi-relational graphs is a fundamental task in various applications, such as social network analysis and recommender systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages the complex relationships between nodes and edges in these graphs. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant neighbors and edge types, enabling more accurate node representations. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of the attention weights, revealing insightful patterns and relationships in the graph structures.
