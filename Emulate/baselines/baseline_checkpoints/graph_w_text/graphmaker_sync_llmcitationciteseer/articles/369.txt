This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent task allocation framework using deep reinforcement learning. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized Markov decision process and utilize a multi-agent deep Q-network to learn the optimal task assignment policy. Our approach enables agents to adapt to dynamic task requirements and learn from their own experiences, without relying on a centralized controller. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient task allocation and improved system performance.
