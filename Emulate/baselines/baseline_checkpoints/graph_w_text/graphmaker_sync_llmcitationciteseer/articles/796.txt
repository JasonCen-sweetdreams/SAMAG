Neural search has shown promise in improving the retrieval performance of information retrieval systems. However, query expansion remains a crucial step in enhancing the search results. This paper introduces a novel query expansion framework that leverages adaptive density estimation to model the underlying document distribution. Our approach, called ADEN, adaptively adjusts the density estimation parameters based on the query complexity and document relevance. We evaluate ADEN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in terms of precision and recall compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
