Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, aiming to improve the recall of relevant documents. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and term weighting schemes, which may not capture the nuances of natural language. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn query expansion strategies from large datasets. We propose a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query representation, term importance, and document ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision, while reducing the computational overhead of query expansion.
