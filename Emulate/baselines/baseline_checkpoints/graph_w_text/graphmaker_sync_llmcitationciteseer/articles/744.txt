Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective passage retrieval to retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach for ODQA. HDR uses a multi-level hierarchy to represent passages, which enables more accurate and efficient retrieval. We introduce a novel scoring function that leverages both lexical and semantic matching to rank passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset show that HDR outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods, achieving a 15% improvement in top-1 passage retrieval accuracy while reducing computational cost by 30%.
