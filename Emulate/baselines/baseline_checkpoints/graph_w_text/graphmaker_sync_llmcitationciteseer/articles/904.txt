Virtual reality (VR) technology has seen significant advancements, but gesture recognition systems remain limited in their ability to accurately detect user intentions. This paper explores the concept of embodiment in VR-based gesture recognition, where the user's sense of body ownership and agency is leveraged to improve system performance. We design and evaluate a novel VR-based gesture recognition system that incorporates visual, auditory, and haptic feedback to enhance embodiment. Our results show that the proposed system achieves significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user experience compared to traditional computer vision-based approaches.
