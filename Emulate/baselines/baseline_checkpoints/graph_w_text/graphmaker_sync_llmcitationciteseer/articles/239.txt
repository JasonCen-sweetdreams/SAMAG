Real-time data warehouses require efficient query optimization to support analytics and decision-making. This paper presents 'AdapQO', a novel query optimization framework that combines machine learning and database techniques to adapt to changing workloads and data distributions. AdapQO leverages a neural network to predict query execution times and dynamically adjusts optimization strategies, leading to significant performance improvements. We evaluate AdapQO on a diverse set of real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
