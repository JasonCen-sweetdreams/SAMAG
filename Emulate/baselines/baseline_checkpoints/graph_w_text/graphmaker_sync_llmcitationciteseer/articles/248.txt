Embodied cognition theories suggest that the mind is grounded in sensorimotor experiences, which can be leveraged to improve learning outcomes. This paper investigates the effectiveness of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR)-based learning environments. We designed a VR-based learning system that incorporates gestural interactions, spatial awareness, and haptic feedback to promote deeper understanding of complex scientific concepts. A user study with 120 participants demonstrates that the embodied cognition approach leads to significant improvements in knowledge retention, transfer, and application compared to traditional desktop-based learning environments. Our findings have implications for the design of immersive learning systems that can enhance educational outcomes.
