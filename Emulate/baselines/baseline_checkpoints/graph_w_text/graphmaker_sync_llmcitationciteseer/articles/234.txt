Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can mislead image classification models. This paper proposes a novel adversarial training framework that leverages hierarchical self-supervision to improve robustness. Our approach involves training multiple levels of self-supervised tasks, from low-level feature learning to high-level semantic understanding, using a hierarchical curriculum. We demonstrate that this framework leads to more robust image classifiers that are resilient to various types of attacks, including white-box and black-box attacks. Experimental results on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance under different attack scenarios.
