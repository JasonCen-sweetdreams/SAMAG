This study explores the impact of personalized avatars on user engagement in virtual reality-based learning environments. We designed an experiment where 120 participants interacted with a virtual reality platform using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that participants using personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, as measured by time spent in the virtual environment and self-reported enjoyment. Furthermore, we found that personalized avatars increased users' sense of presence and embodiment, leading to improved learning outcomes. The implications of these findings for the design of virtual reality-based educational systems are discussed.
