This paper presents a novel decentralized coordination framework for autonomous agents in smart grids, enabling efficient resource allocation and adaptive decision-making. Our approach leverages distributed constraint optimization and multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize energy distribution, reduce peak demand, and improve grid resilience. We evaluate our framework using a realistic simulation environment and demonstrate significant improvements in resource efficiency, response time, and scalability compared to traditional centralized approaches.
