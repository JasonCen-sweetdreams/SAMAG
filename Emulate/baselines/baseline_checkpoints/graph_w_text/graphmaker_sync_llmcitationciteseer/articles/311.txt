Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve the lives of older adults, but existing systems often neglect their unique needs and abilities. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible conversational interfaces tailored to older adults. We conducted a series of focus groups and co-design workshops with older adults to identify key design recommendations, including the use of simple and consistent language, visual cues, and error forgiveness. We implemented these recommendations in a prototype conversational agent and evaluated its usability with 30 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
