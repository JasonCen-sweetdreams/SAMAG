The increasing adoption of NoSQL databases in modern data management has led to the development of hybrid relational-NoSQL systems. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'HybridOpt', which leverages the strengths of both relational and NoSQL paradigms. HybridOpt introduces a cost-based optimization approach that considers the underlying data storage and query patterns to generate efficient query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HybridOpt outperforms existing optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
