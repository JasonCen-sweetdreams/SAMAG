This study investigates the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to alleviate cognitive load in elderly individuals. We designed an ECA system, 'ElderCare', which utilizes multimodal inputs (speech, gesture, and facial expression) to provide personalized assistance. Our user study involved 30 elderly participants who interacted with ElderCare to complete various tasks. Results show that ElderCare significantly reduced cognitive load, as measured by pupil dilation and self-reported metrics, compared to traditional text-based interfaces. Our findings have implications for the development of accessible and user-centered HCI systems for aging populations.
