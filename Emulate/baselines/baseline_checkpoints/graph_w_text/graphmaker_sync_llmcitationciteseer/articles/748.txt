Knowledge graph construction relies on accurate entity disambiguation, which becomes increasingly challenging with large-scale datasets. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphED', that leverages graph-based embeddings to disambiguate entities in a scalable manner. We design a graph neural network that jointly learns entity and context representations, enabling effective disambiguation even in the presence of limited training data. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly for entities with few occurrences.
