Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in knowledge graph construction, but traditional methods suffer from scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'KGEmbedD', which leverages knowledge graph embeddings to efficiently disambiguate entities. We learn vector representations of entities and their contexts, enabling fast similarity calculations and accurate disambiguation. Experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that KGEmbedD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.
