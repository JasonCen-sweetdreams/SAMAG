Query expansion (QE) techniques are crucial for improving the effectiveness of search engines. This paper proposes a novel latent semantic analysis (LSA) approach for QE, which leverages the semantic relationships between terms in a query to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our method, called LSA-QE, incorporates a deep neural network to learn the latent semantic representations of terms and queries. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that LSA-QE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, leading to significant improvements in search engine performance. We also demonstrate the robustness of LSA-QE against query ambiguity and polysemy.
