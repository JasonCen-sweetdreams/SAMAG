Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query representations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQERL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn an optimal policy for selecting expansion terms. We model the query expansion process as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn the value function. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15.2% in terms of mean average precision.
