Cloud-based data warehouses have become increasingly popular for storing and processing large datasets. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper addresses the problem of efficient join ordering for distributed query optimization in cloud-based data warehouses. We propose a novel approach, 'Distributed Join Optimizer' (DJO), which leverages a combination of statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to identify the most efficient join ordering. DJO is designed to adapt to dynamic changes in data distributions and query workloads, thereby improving query performance and reducing resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DJO outperforms existing optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
