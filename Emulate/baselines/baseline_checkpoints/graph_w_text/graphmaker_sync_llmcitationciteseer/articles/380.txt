As the population ages, there is a growing need for accessible and effective interfaces for older adults. Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have shown promise in reducing cognitive load, but their efficacy in this context is understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining the impact of ECAs on cognitive load and user experience in older adults. Our results show that ECAs can significantly reduce cognitive load compared to traditional graphical user interfaces, particularly for tasks requiring working memory and attention. We also identify key design factors influencing user experience and provide guidelines for ECA development in this domain.
