Distributed database systems face significant performance challenges due to data replication and consistency maintenance. This paper presents a novel approach, 'AdaptRep', which dynamically adjusts replication factors based on real-time query patterns and data access frequencies. Our experiments on a large-scale distributed database testbed demonstrate that AdaptRep reduces query response times by up to 35% and improves system throughput by 21%, compared to traditional fixed-replication strategies. We also develop a theoretical model to guide replication factor adaptation, which is validated through extensive simulations.
