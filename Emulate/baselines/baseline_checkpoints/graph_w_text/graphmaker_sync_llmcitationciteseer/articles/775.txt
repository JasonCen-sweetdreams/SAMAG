Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education, but limited research has explored the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user engagement. This study investigates the effect of customized avatars on user experience, motivation, and learning outcomes in VR-based learning environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigned to either a personalized avatar or a default avatar condition. Results show that participants with personalized avatars reported higher levels of engagement, enjoyment, and self-efficacy, and achieved better learning outcomes compared to those with default avatars. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based learning systems and highlight the importance of personalized avatars in promoting user engagement.
