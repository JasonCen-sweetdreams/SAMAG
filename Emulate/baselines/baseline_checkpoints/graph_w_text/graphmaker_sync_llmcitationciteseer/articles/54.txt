Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence, particularly in scenarios where agents have limited communication and partial observability of the environment. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HiGAT) framework for coordinating multi-agent systems. HiGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to learn agent representations and hierarchical graph pooling to capture complex dependencies between agents. We evaluate HiGAT on a variety of multi-agent coordination tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and coordination efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
