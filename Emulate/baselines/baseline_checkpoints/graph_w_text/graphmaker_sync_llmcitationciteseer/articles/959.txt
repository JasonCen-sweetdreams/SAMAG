Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize learning experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user participation and motivation in VR-based educational settings. We designed an experiment involving 120 participants, who interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a VR learning environment. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars reported higher levels of engagement, enjoyment, and self-efficacy compared to those with generic avatars. We also found that the personalization effect was more pronounced for users with lower prior experience in VR. The findings have implications for the design of inclusive and effective VR-based learning systems.
