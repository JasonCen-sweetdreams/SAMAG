Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, as it helps to mitigate the vocabulary mismatch problem. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach to query expansion, dubbed 'DeepQE'. Our method employs a Markov decision process to model the query expansion process and utilizes a deep neural network to learn the optimal expansion strategy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing the computational cost. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the learned expansion strategies, shedding light on the effectiveness of our approach.
