Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder affecting articulation and pronunciation, often struggle to interact with these systems. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an inclusive voice assistant, tailored to the needs of individuals with dysarthria. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and interviews with users, caregivers, and speech therapists to inform the development of our system. Our approach incorporates acoustic models trained on dysarthric speech, personalized error correction, and adaptive feedback mechanisms. Results from a usability study demonstrate significant improvements in user engagement, accuracy, and overall satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
