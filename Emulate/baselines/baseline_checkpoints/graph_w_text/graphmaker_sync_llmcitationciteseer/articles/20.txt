Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interaction design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a multimodal interaction study that explores the challenges and opportunities of designing inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, using a combination of surveys, interviews, and usability testing. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating visual and tactile cues, simplifying language processing, and providing contextual support to facilitate independent use. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating more accessible and user-centered voice assistants that can empower older adults in their daily lives.
