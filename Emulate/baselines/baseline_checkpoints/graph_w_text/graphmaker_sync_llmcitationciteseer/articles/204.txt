Multi-modal time series data, which combines different sensor readings or data sources, is increasingly prevalent in various domains. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture for effectively modeling complex dependencies in multi-modal time series data. HGAT employs a hierarchical graph structure to capture both local and global patterns, while attention mechanisms selectively focus on relevant modalities and time steps. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate HGAT's superiority in forecasting and anomaly detection tasks compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
