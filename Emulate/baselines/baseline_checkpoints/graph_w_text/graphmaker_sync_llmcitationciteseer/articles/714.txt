Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture user intent from short queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages neural semantic embeddings to enrich query representations. By jointly learning query and document embeddings, NeuroQE captures nuanced semantic relationships between terms and identifies informative expansion candidates. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, showcasing the potential of neural embeddings in query expansion for ad-hoc retrieval.
