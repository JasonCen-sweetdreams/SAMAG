Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep learning-based embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, dubbed 'EmbedExpan', uses a combination of word2vec and transformer-based architectures to generate contextualized embeddings for query terms. These embeddings are then used to expand the original query, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EmbedExpan, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
