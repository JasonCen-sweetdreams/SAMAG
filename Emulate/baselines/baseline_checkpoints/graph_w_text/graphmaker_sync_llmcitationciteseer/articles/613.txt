In complex systems, coordinating autonomous agents to achieve efficient resource allocation is a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to train agents to adapt to changing environments and coordinate with each other. We develop a decentralized framework, 'AdaptCoord', which enables agents to learn from their experiences and adjust their resource allocation strategies in real-time. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid system demonstrate that AdaptCoord outperforms traditional optimization methods, achieving up to 25% reduction in resource waste and 30% improvement in system efficiency.
