In this paper, we tackle the decentralized task allocation problem for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities and preferences need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, 'MAgent-alloc', which learns to assign tasks to agents based on their characteristics and the task requirements. Our approach utilizes a graph neural network to model the agent-task interactions and a decentralized actor-critic framework to optimize the task allocation policy. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of MAgent-alloc in achieving high task completion rates and efficient resource utilization.
