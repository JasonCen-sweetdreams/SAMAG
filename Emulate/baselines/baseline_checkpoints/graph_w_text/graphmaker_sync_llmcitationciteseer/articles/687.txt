Counterfactual reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human decision-making, but existing AI systems lack the ability to provide interpretable explanations for their predictions. This paper introduces Causal Graph Attention Networks (CGANs), a novel framework that integrates graph attention mechanisms with causal inference to generate explainable counterfactuals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CGANs on a real-world healthcare dataset, showing that they outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and explanation quality. Our approach has significant implications for building trustworthy AI systems that can provide actionable insights for decision-makers.
