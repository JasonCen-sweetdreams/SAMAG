Hierarchical neural networks have shown remarkable performance in image retrieval tasks, but their computational complexity hinders large-scale deployment. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'HNN-Index', which enables efficient similarity search and retrieval of images in massive datasets. By exploiting the hierarchical structure of the neural network, HNN-Index reduces the search space and accelerates the computation of similarity metrics. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that HNN-Index achieves a 5x speedup over existing indexing methods while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy.
