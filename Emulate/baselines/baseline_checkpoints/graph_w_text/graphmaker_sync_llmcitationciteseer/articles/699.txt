Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, query performance remains a significant challenge due to data replication and partitioning. This paper proposes AWAR (Adaptive Workload-Aware Replication), a novel replication strategy that dynamically adjusts data placement based on real-time workload analysis. AWAR leverages a hierarchical clustering approach to group similar queries and allocate replicas accordingly, reducing query latency by up to 30%. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of AWAR in improving query performance and scalability in DDS.
