In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem due to the lack of a central authority and limited communication between agents. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to learn task allocation policies for each agent. Our method, called Dec-TAR, uses a decentralized actor-critic framework to learn both individual and joint policies for task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm scenario demonstrate that Dec-TAR outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system utility.
