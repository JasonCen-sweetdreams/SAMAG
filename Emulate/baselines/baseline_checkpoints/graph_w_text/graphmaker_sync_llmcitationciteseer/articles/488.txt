Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient retrieval of relevant passages from a massive corpus to answer a given question. This paper proposes a novel end-to-end neural retrieval framework, 'NeurRetriever', which replaces traditional pipeline-based approaches. Our model leverages a hierarchical encoder to jointly learn question and passage representations, and a differentiable retrieval mechanism to optimize the retrieval process. Experiments on the Natural Questions benchmark show that NeurRetriever outperforms state-of-the-art pipeline-based models, achieving 5.2% absolute improvement in exact match score while reducing inference time by 30%.
