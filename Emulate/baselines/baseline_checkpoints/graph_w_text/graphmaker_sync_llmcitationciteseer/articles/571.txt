Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, but traditional approaches struggle to handle complex query patterns and large-scale data sets. This paper proposes a novel graph-based query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph neural networks to model query patterns and optimize query plans. We develop a scalable graph-based query representation and a efficient optimization algorithm that exploits the structural properties of the graph. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database benchmark show that GraphOpt achieves up to 3x speedup compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
