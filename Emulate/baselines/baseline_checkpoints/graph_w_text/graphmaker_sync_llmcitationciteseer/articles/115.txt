This paper presents a study on designing conversational interfaces that are accessible and usable for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of user studies with 30 participants to identify the challenges they face when interacting with voice assistants. Our results show that participants struggled with complex dialogue flows, ambiguous intent recognition, and lack of feedback. We propose a set of design guidelines and principles for creating more inclusive conversational interfaces, including the use of simple and consistent language, explicit intent confirmation, and multimodal feedback. Our findings have implications for the development of more accessible and supportive conversational AI systems for older adults.
