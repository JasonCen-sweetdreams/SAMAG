Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep learning-based word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Our method, called 'EmbedExpan', uses a context-aware embedding model to generate a set of expansion terms that are both semantically similar and contextually relevant to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmbedExpan outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, leading to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
