Traditional information retrieval systems rely on exact keyword matching, which often fails to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'NQG-Rank', which leverages graph neural networks to encode query-document interactions. By representing queries as graphs and documents as nodes, our model can effectively capture contextual and relational information, leading to improved ranking performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of NQG-Rank over state-of-the-art neural ranking models, particularly in handling complex, multi-entity queries.
