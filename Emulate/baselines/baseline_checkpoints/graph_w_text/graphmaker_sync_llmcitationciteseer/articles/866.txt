The exponential growth of online data has made efficient document filtering a critical component of modern information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) framework for scalable document filtering. Our approach leverages the graph structure of document collections to learn hierarchical representations of documents, enabling efficient filtering of irrelevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HGNN-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of filtering accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a promising solution for large-scale information retrieval applications.
