Voice-based interfaces are increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create inclusive voice-based interfaces for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify their needs, preferences, and pain points when interacting with voice-based systems. Our results highlight the importance of considering age-related cognitive and physical changes in interface design. We propose a set of design guidelines and recommendations for creating more accessible and usable voice-based interfaces for older adults.
