This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in shaping human-computer interaction (HCI) in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed an immersive VR experiment to investigate how users' bodily experiences influence their problem-solving strategies and performance in a spatial reasoning task. Our results show that participants who underwent a brief embodied cognition induction exhibited improved task performance and reduced cognitive load compared to a control group. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of more intuitive and effective VR-based interfaces, and highlight the potential for embodied cognition to inform the development of more human-centered HCI systems.
