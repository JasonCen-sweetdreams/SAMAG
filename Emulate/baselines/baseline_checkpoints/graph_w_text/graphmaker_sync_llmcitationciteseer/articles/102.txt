Explainable recommendation systems are crucial for building trust with users. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attentional Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) that incorporates both item and user graph structures to generate personalized explanations. HAGNN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges, allowing for interpretable recommendations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of explanation quality and recommendation accuracy.
