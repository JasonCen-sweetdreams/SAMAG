As the scale of distributed document collections grows, query processing efficiency becomes a critical concern. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-Dist', which leverages the structural properties of distributed index organizations to reduce the number of query iterations. HQE-Dist adaptively selects a subset of promising terms from the initial query results, expands the query using a hierarchical clustering scheme, and prunes irrelevant documents using a probabilistic relevance model. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed IR benchmark demonstrate that HQE-Dist achieves a 30% reduction in query latency and a 25% improvement in retrieval precision compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
