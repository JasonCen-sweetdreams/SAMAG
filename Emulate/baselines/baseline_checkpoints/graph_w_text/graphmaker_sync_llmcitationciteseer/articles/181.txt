Recommendation systems have become ubiquitous, but their opacity hinders user trust. This paper proposes a novel graph attention network (GAT) architecture, 'ExploRe', which generates personalized recommendations while providing interpretability. By incorporating attention mechanisms on user-item graphs, ExploRe identifies influential items and highlights relevant features, enabling users to understand the reasoning behind the suggested items. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ExploRe outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction, while offering explainable insights into the recommendation process.
