Existing learning-to-rank (LTR) models for structured queries often rely on explicit feature engineering, ignoring the rich relational context within the query graph. We propose GraphRP, a novel LTR framework that infuses relevance propagation into the graph-based query representation. By modeling the query as a heterogeneous graph, GraphRP captures both syntactic and semantic relationships between entities, and learns to propagate relevance signals across the graph. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset of complex queries demonstrate that GraphRP outperforms state-of-the-art LTR models, achieving significant improvements in ranking accuracy and relevance metrics.
