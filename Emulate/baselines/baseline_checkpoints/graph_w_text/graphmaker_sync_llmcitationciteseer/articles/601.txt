In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'AdaTask', which leverages reinforcement learning to coordinate autonomous agents in dynamic environments. AdaTask uses a decentralized, actor-critic architecture to learn optimal task assignments based on individual agent capabilities, task priorities, and environmental constraints. We evaluate AdaTask in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional, manually-programmed allocation strategies.
