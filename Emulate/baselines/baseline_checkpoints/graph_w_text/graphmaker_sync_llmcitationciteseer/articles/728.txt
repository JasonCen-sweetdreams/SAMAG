Coordinating autonomous agents in complex, dynamic environments remains a significant challenge in multi-agent systems. This paper presents a novel framework for hierarchical task decomposition and reward shaping, enabling agents to reason about high-level goals and adapt to changing task requirements. We introduce a graph-based representation of tasks and subtasks, allowing agents to recursively decompose complex tasks into manageable sub-problems. Additionally, we propose a reward shaping mechanism that incorporates domain knowledge and incentives for cooperative behavior. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving agent coordination and task completion rates.
