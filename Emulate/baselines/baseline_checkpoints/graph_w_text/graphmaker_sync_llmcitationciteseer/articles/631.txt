Dynamic social networks exhibit complex relationships between nodes, making node classification challenging. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework that captures multi-scale dependencies and temporal dynamics in these networks. HGAT leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and timestamps, enabling accurate classification of nodes. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in node classification, outperforming state-of-the-art graph neural network models.
