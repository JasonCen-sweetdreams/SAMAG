Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in enhancing learning outcomes, but the role of personalization in these environments remains understudied. This paper investigates the effects of personalized recommendations on user engagement in VR-based learning systems. We designed and deployed a VR platform that incorporates machine learning-based user modeling and adaptive content selection. Our user study with 120 participants reveals that personalized VR experiences lead to significant increases in user engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention compared to non-personalized counterparts. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR-based learning systems.
