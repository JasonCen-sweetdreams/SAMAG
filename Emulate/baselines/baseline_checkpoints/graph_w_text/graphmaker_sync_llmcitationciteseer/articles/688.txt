We present a novel decentralized multi-agent system (MAS) framework for autonomous resource allocation in smart grids. The proposed approach leverages a hybrid of reinforcement learning and auctions to enable self-organizing agents to negotiate and allocate resources in real-time. Our simulation results demonstrate improved efficiency, scalability, and adaptability compared to traditional centralized approaches. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the system's convergence properties and explore the impact of agent heterogeneity on overall system performance.
