In complex multi-agent systems, coordinating autonomous agents to achieve efficient resource allocation is a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HRL-CAA', that enables agents to learn coordination strategies in a decentralized manner. Our approach integrates a high-level planning module with a low-level execution module, allowing agents to adapt to changing environments and optimize resource allocation. We evaluate HRL-CAA in a simulated smart grid scenario, demonstrating improved resource allocation efficiency and reduced energy waste compared to traditional decentralized control methods.
