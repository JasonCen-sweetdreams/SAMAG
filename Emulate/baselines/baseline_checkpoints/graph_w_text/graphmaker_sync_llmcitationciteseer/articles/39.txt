Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on manually crafted features or word co-occurrence statistics. We propose a neural query expansion approach that leverages dense embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our model, 'NeuQE', incorporates a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query term similarity and relevance feedback. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that NeuQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly for verbose queries and cold-start topics.
