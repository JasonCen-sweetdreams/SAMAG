Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc search, but existing methods often sacrifice retrieval efficiency for improved effectiveness. This paper introduces a hybrid retrieval model, 'HybEx', which combines the strengths of lexical and semantic expansion techniques. HybEx leverages a neural network-based query intent detector to selectively apply expansion strategies, reducing the number of redundant terms and improving query latency. Our experiments on the TREC ad-hoc search dataset demonstrate that HybEx achieves state-of-the-art effectiveness while reducing query processing time by up to 30% compared to existing methods.
