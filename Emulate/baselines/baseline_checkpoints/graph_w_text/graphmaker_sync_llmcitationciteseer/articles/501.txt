Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility for users with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences, focusing on users with visual and motor impairments. We propose a set of guidelines and tools for designers and developers to create accessible VR interfaces, including adaptive navigation, personalized feedback, and embodied interaction techniques. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting improved user engagement and satisfaction.
