This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for real-time traffic signal control in large-scale urban networks. Our method, dubbed 'MARLIN', leverages a hierarchical architecture to coordinate the actions of multiple agents, each responsible for controlling a single intersection. We propose a novel communication mechanism that enables agents to share local observations and adapt to dynamic traffic patterns. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate that MARLIN outperforms traditional signals timing plans, reducing average travel times by 23% and increasing network throughput by 17%.
