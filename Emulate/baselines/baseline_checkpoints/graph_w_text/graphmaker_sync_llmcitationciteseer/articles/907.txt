Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc search systems, as it can significantly impact retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. Our method, dubbed 'NeuroExpander', leverages a combination of word embeddings and recurrent neural networks to generate high-quality expansion terms. We evaluate NeuroExpander on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion techniques. Furthermore, we analyze the learned representations and provide insights into the effectiveness of our approach.
