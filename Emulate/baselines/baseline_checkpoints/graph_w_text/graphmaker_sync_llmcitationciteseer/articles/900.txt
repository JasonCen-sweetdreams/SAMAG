Modern distributed databases rely on query optimization to minimize latency and improve performance. However, existing optimization techniques often fail to capture complex relationships between data entities. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn query optimization strategies. By modeling database schema and query graphs, GraphOpt identifies efficient execution plans that reduce query latency by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world distributed database benchmark and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling complex queries.
