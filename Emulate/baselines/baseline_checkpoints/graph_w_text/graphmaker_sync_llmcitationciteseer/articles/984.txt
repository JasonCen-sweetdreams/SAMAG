Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, dubbed 'GraphExpan', which leverages graph-based embeddings to model semantic relationships between query terms. By incorporating entity disambiguation and contextualized word representations, GraphExpan significantly improves retrieval performance compared to traditional lexical-based methods. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
