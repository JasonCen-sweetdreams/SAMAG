Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks to optimize query plans. We model the database schema as a graph and use a graph neural network to learn a representation of the query plan space. Our approach, called 'GQN', uses this representation to efficiently explore the query plan space and identify optimal plans. Experimental results on a real-world benchmark dataset demonstrate that GQN outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query execution time and plan quality.
