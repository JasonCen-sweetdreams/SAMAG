Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach that leverages context-aware embeddings to incorporate semantic and syntactic cues from the query context. Our method, dubbed ConEx, learns to identify and weigh relevant expansion terms based on their contextual similarity to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConEx significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving an average precision gain of 12.5% at rank 10.
