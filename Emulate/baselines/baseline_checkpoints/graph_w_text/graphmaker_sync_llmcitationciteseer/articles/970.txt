The proliferation of digital documents has created a pressing need for efficient and effective document retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to capture semantic relationships between documents. By recursively applying graph attention mechanisms, our approach can identify semantically similar documents at multiple abstraction levels. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval techniques, achieving a 23% improvement in mean average precision. We also show that our HGNN-based approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing keyword-based retrieval systems to further enhance their performance.
