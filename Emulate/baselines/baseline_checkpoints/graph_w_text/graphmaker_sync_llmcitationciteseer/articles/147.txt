Distributed databases have become increasingly popular due to the growing volume and complexity of data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We represent the database schema as a graph and leverage GCNs to learn a latent representation of the query plan space. Our method, called QOGCN, uses this representation to predict optimal query plans, resulting in significant performance improvements over traditional optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world benchmark demonstrate that QOGCN outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
