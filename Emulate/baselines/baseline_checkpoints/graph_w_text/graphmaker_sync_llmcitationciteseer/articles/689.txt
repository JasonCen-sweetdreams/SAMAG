Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle with document representation, leading to suboptimal query performance. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical document representation (HDR) approach that captures both local and global semantic relationships within documents. Our method represents documents as a nested hierarchy of semantic clusters, allowing for efficient pruning of irrelevant documents during query processing. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HDR achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art dense passage retrieval methods.
