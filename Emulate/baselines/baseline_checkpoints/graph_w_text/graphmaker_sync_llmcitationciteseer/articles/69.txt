As AI-powered systems increasingly rely on time-series data, the risk of adversarial attacks grows. This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting such attacks using graph-based anomaly detection. Our method, 'TS-GAD', represents time-series data as graphs and leverages graph neural networks to identify patterns indicative of malicious behavior. We evaluate TS-GAD on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting real-world attacks, achieving an F1-score of 0.95 compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach has significant implications for securing AI systems in applications such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity.
