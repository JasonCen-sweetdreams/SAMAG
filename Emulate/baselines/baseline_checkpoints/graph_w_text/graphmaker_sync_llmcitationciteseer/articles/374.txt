Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, where the goal is to enrich the original query with relevant terms to improve retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the power of deep graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model the complex relationships between query terms and their expansions. Our model, dubbed 'GraphQE', learns to represent queries and their expansions as graph-structured data, and uses GCNs to capture higher-order dependencies between terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
