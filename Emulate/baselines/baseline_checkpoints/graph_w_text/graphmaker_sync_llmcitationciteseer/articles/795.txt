Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when faced with limited labeled data. This paper presents a novel meta-learning approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a task-agnostic representation for image classification. Our method, dubbed 'MetaGNN', adaptively constructs a graph structure from the support set and queries, enabling effective knowledge transfer across tasks. We demonstrate the efficacy of MetaGNN on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-shot classification scenarios.
