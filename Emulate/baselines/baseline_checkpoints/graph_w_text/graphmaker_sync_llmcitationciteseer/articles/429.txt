This paper presents a novel approach to scalable multi-agent task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We propose a hierarchical DCOP framework, where agents are organized into clusters and allocate tasks within their respective clusters using a decentralized constraint optimization algorithm. The proposed approach is evaluated on a realistic logistics scenario, where multiple agents need to be assigned to transport tasks with varying constraints. Experimental results demonstrate a significant reduction in computation time and improved solution quality compared to traditional centralized approaches.
