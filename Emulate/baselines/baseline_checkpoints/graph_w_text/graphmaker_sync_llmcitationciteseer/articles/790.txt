Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has become crucial for businesses to understand customer opinions. However, existing ABSA models struggle with multilingual product reviews, where aspects and sentiments vary across languages. This paper proposes a novel adaptive ABSA framework, 'PolyGlot', which leverages transfer learning and language-agnostic aspect extraction. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both aspect-specific and language-invariant sentiment patterns. Experimental results on a large-scale multilingual review dataset demonstrate that PolyGlot outperforms state-of-the-art ABSA models, achieving significant improvements in aspect detection and sentiment classification across six languages.
