Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale search queries. However, the communication overhead between nodes can significantly impact query efficiency. This paper presents a novel hierarchical indexing approach, HI-DIR, which leverages a two-level indexing structure to reduce the number of node interactions during query processing. Experimental results on a large-scale text corpus demonstrate that HI-DIR achieves an average query response time reduction of 37% compared to state-of-the-art DIR systems while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy.
