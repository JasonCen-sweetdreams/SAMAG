Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it can significantly improve the retrieval performance. However, existing query expansion techniques often rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. Our approach uses a multi-level attention mechanism to selectively expand queries based on their contextual importance. Experimental results on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
