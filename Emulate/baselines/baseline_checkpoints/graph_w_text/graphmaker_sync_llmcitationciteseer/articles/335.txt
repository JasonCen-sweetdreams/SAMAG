The increasing popularity of knowledge graphs has led to a surge in RDF data storage and querying. Existing solutions for scalable RDF query processing often rely on centralized indexing, which becomes a bottleneck in distributed graph databases. This paper presents a novel distributed indexing approach, 'RDFix', that leverages graph partitioning and parallelization to accelerate query execution. RDFix utilizes a hierarchical indexing structure that adaptively adjusts to the query workload, reducing the communication overhead between nodes. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that RDFix outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time and scalability.
