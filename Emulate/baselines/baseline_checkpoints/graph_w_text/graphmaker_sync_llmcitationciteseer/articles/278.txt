Individuals with motor impairments often rely on alternative text entry methods, which can be slow and error-prone. This paper presents EyeGazeType, a machine learning-based system that leverages eye gaze and keystroke patterns to predict and complete words in real-time. Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) for gaze pattern recognition with a recurrent neural network (RNN) for language modeling. Evaluation with 20 participants with motor impairments shows that EyeGazeType significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of text entry speed and accuracy, enabling more efficient communication for individuals with disabilities.
