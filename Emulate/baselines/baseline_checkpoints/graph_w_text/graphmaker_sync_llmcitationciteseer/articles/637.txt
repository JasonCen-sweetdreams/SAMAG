Medical information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to handle complex queries, leading to poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'MedEx', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of medical concepts. We develop a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture relationships between query terms and medical entities, enabling effective expansion of queries. Experimental results on a benchmark medical dataset demonstrate that MedEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in retrieval precision and recall.
