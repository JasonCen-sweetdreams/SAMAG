Gesture recognition systems often struggle to accommodate users with diverse abilities and preferences. This paper presents a novel, probabilistic approach to personalized gesture recognition, leveraging hierarchical Bayesian networks (HBNs) to model user-specific gesture patterns. Our framework, 'GESTURE+', incorporates domain knowledge and user feedback to adapt the recognition model, ensuring improved accuracy and inclusivity for users with disabilities. Experiments with a heterogeneous user group demonstrate significant performance gains over traditional machine learning approaches, highlighting the potential of HBN-based methods for enhancing accessibility in HCI.
