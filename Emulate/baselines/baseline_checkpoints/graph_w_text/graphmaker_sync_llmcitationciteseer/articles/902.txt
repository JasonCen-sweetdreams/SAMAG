As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible interfaces that can accommodate the physical and cognitive changes associated with aging. This paper presents a machine learning-driven approach to designing gesture-based interfaces that are intuitive and usable for older adults. We collect a dataset of gestures from a diverse group of older adults and use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and preferences. Our results show that the proposed approach can improve gesture recognition accuracy by up to 25% compared to traditional methods, and user studies demonstrate significant improvements in user experience and satisfaction.
