In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'GATE', which leverages graph attention networks (GATs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. GATE enables agents to learn attention weights that reflect the importance of their neighbors' tasks, facilitating coordinated decision-making. We evaluate GATE on a variety of benchmark scenarios, demonstrating improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art decentralized approaches.
