 Commonsense reasoning is a crucial aspect of human intelligence, yet it remains a challenging task for AI systems. This paper proposes a novel knowledge graph embedding method, 'HAT-KGE', which leverages hierarchical attention to capture complex relationships between entities and their attributes. By incorporating a graph neural network with attention-based aggregation, HAT-KGE outperforms state-of-the-art models on several benchmarks, including ConceptNet and ATOMIC. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various commonsense reasoning tasks, such as event prediction and scenario understanding.
