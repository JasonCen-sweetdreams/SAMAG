Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various fields, but current VR systems often lack tactile feedback, leading to a sense of disconnection from the virtual environment. This paper explores the impact of haptic feedback on user experience in VR. We designed and implemented a custom VR system that incorporates vibrotactile feedback, and conducted a user study to evaluate its effects on presence, immersion, and overall user satisfaction. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly enhances user experience, particularly in tasks requiring object manipulation and spatial awareness. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems.
