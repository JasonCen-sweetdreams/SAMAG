Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly popular, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by difficulties in error recovery. This paper presents a study on designing accessible voice-based interfaces for older adults, focusing on error recovery strategies. We conducted a series of user studies with 30 older adults, investigating the effectiveness of four error recovery strategies: explicit error messages, implicit error correction, proactive error prevention, and adaptive error recovery. Our results show that a combination of explicit error messages and adaptive error recovery leads to significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of voice-based interfaces that cater to the needs of older adults.
