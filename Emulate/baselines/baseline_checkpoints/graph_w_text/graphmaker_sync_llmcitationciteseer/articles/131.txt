Database-as-a-Service (DaaS) platforms have become increasingly popular, offering scalable and on-demand database resources to multiple tenants. However, optimizing query performance in such multi-tenant environments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'QTune', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning-based prediction models to identify optimal query execution plans. QTune incorporates a tenant-aware cost model and a dynamic resource allocation strategy to minimize query latency and maximize resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world DaaS platform demonstrate that QTune achieves an average query performance improvement of 32% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
