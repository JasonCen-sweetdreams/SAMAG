Distributed databases are increasingly used to store large amounts of multi-dimensional data. However, efficient indexing techniques for range queries in such systems remain a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, 'DIMRI', which leverages a combination of hierarchical clustering and compact bit-vector representations to accelerate range query processing. We demonstrate the efficacy of DIMRI through a comprehensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets, showcasing significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
