Recommender systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate user ratings to promote or demote items. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect such attacks using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the user-item interaction graph and design a GNN-based detector that learns to identify suspicious patterns. Our approach is robust to various types of attacks and outperforms existing detection methods. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in detecting adversarial attacks and improving the overall recommendation quality.
