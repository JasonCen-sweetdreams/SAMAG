Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of individuals with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants, focusing on users with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies to identify key accessibility requirements. Our findings informed the development of 'AccessibleVox', a novel voice assistant that incorporates adaptive speech recognition, personalized feedback, and multimodal interaction. Evaluation results show significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates for users with disabilities.
