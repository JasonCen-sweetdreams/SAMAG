Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach that leverages hierarchical task embeddings to adapt to new classes with limited labeled examples. We introduce a hierarchical task encoder that captures both global and local task relationships, enabling more effective knowledge transfer across tasks. Our method, 'Meta-HTE', achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including mini-ImageNet and CIFAR-FS. We also provide insights into the importance of task embeddings and their hierarchical structure in few-shot learning scenarios.
