Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) is a crucial task in modern search engines, where users query in one language and expect relevant results in another. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep neural networks, which leverages bilingual word embeddings and sentence encoders to generate context-aware expansions. Our experiments on the bilingual English-Spanish CLIR dataset show that our method significantly outperforms traditional translation-based approaches, achieving a 25% improvement in mean average precision. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling out-of-vocabulary words and named entities.
