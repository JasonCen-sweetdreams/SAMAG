This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for autonomous agents using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'AgentDRL', which enables agents to learn efficient task allocation strategies through interactions with their environment and other agents. Our approach leverages a multi-agent deep Q-network to model the complex relationships between agents and tasks, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in a simulated warehouse management scenario. Experimental results show that AgentDRL outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
