Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of haptic feedback on user experience and learning outcomes in VR-based learning environments. We designed a VR system that incorporates tactile feedback and conducted a controlled experiment with 120 participants. Results show that haptic feedback significantly enhances user engagement, presence, and learning transfer, particularly for complex tasks. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based educational systems and highlight the importance of incorporating multimodal feedback to enhance user experience.
