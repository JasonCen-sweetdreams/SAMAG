This paper proposes a novel distributed cooperative search algorithm for multi-agent systems. Our approach, called DistriCBS, is based on Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and enables multiple agents to search for a common goal while avoiding conflicts. We introduce a decentralized conflict detection mechanism that allows agents to dynamically adjust their search strategies. Experimental results on various benchmark problems demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of DistriCBS, outperforming existing distributed search algorithms in terms of solution quality and computation time.
