Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in many real-world applications, including social networks, molecular biology, and recommender systems. This paper proposes a novel deep graph multi-task learning framework, 'GraphMTL', which jointly learns node classification and graph reconstruction tasks. GraphMTL leverages a hierarchical graph attention mechanism to capture node and graph-level representations, and incorporates a reinforcement learning-based optimization strategy to adaptively weigh task losses. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in node classification accuracy and graph reconstruction quality compared to state-of-the-art single-task models.
