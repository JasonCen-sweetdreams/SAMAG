Learning representations from structured data, such as graphs, is a crucial task in machine learning. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges at multiple scales. HGAN captures complex patterns and relationships in graph-structured data by iteratively applying attention-based graph pooling and feature refinement. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in improving graph classification, node classification, and link prediction tasks.
