This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve the effectiveness of ad-hoc retrieval systems. We formulate query expansion as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to select a subset of expansion terms that maximize the expected relevance of the retrieved documents. Our DRL model, called QERL, uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QERL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
