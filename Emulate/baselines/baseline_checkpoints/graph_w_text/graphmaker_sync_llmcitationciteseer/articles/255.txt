As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly pervasive, it is essential to ensure that its benefits are accessible to diverse user populations, including older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating AR interfaces that accommodate the needs of this demographic. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers, which informed the development of a set of design guidelines and recommendations for accessible AR interaction. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and multimodal feedback in AR interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments.
