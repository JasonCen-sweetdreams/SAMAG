Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a crucial component in question answering (QA) systems. However, existing KGE methods often neglect the importance of relation attention in capturing complex semantic relationships. This paper proposes a novel KGE framework, 'ARA-KGE', which adaptively learns relation attention weights based on the question context. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant relations and entities, leading to improved QA performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ARA-KGE in outperforming state-of-the-art KGE methods.
