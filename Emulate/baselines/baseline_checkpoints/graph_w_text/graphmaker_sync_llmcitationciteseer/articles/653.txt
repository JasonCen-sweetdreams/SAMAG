Citation recommendation systems play a crucial role in facilitating scholarly communication and advancing research. This paper proposes a novel graph attention network (GAT) based approach for citation recommendation, which leverages the structural properties of citation graphs to model complex relationships between papers. Our method, GraphCite, incorporates node and edge features from the citation graph, and employs a multi-head attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant neighboring papers. Experimental results on the Cora dataset demonstrate that GraphCite outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recall and precision, while reducing computational overhead.
