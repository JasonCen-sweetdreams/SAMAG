Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on effective query expansion to retrieve relevant passages. We propose a novel neural re-ranking approach, QRex, which leverages BERT-based semantic representations to refine the query expansion process. QRex learns to identify and weight informative keywords, reducing the impact of noisy terms and improving the quality of the retrieved passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that QRex outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 12% increase in Top-1 accuracy and a 20% improvement in Mean Average Precision.
