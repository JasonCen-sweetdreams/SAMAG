Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture nuanced query semantics, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to model complex query relationships. Our approach represents queries as graphs, where nodes correspond to terms and edges capture their semantic dependencies. The HGNN learns to aggregate and propagate information across the graph, generating a set of expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness compared to traditional query expansion methods.
