Virtual reality (VR) technology has made tremendous progress in recent years, but the impact of embodiment on user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a systematic investigation of how different levels of embodiment (from simple controllers to full-body tracking) affect users' sense of presence, engagement, and cognitive load in VR environments. Our study involves 120 participants and employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative feedback. Results show that higher levels of embodiment lead to increased presence and engagement, but also introduce significant cognitive load. We discuss implications for VR system design and highlight areas for future research.
