Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised query expansion method, Hierarchical Graph-based Embeddings for Retrieval (HGER), which leverages graph neural networks to model complex query-document relationships. HGER represents queries and documents as hierarchical graph structures, allowing for the capture of nuanced contextual information. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, particularly for ambiguous and long-tail queries.
