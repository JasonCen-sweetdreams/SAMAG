Multi-tenancy has become a dominant paradigm in cloud-based database systems, where a single database instance serves multiple tenants. However, this raises significant query optimization challenges due to varying workload patterns and resource constraints. We propose a novel optimization framework, 'MT-QOpt', which leverages machine learning-based workload prediction and adaptive resource allocation to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. Our experimental evaluation using a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrates that MT-QOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 35% in terms of query response time.
