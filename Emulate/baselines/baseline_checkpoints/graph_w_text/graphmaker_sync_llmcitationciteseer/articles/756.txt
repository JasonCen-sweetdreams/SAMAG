Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved impressive successes in complex domains, but its lack of interpretability hinders its adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper presents a novel approach, 'Attend2State', which integrates attention mechanisms into state abstraction to provide Explainable RL (XRL). By learning to focus on relevant state features, our method enables the identification of key factors influencing the agent's decision-making process. We evaluate Attend2State on several Atari games and a real-world autonomous driving scenario, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability compared to traditional DRL methods.
