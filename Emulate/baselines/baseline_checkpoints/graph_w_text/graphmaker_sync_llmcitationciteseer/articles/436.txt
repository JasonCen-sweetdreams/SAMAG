Session-based search is a crucial component of modern search engines, where the goal is to re-rank documents based on the user's search history. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, 'SessionGNN', that models the complex relationships between queries, documents, and user interactions. We introduce a context-aware re-ranking mechanism that incorporates session-level features, such as query similarity and document co-occurrence, to improve the ranking accuracy. Experimental results on a large-scale search log dataset demonstrate that SessionGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including BERT-based and neural ranking models, in terms of relevance and diversity metrics.
