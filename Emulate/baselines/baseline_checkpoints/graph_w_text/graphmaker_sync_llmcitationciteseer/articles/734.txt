This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for multi-agent dialogue systems, enabling explainable decision-making and improved dialogue coherence. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents, utterances, and context, thereby facilitating more accurate and interpretable dialogue state tracking. We evaluate our model on a large-scale, multi-agent dialogue dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in dialogue success rate and human evaluation metrics compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our architecture provides a promising step towards developing more transparent and trustworthy AI-powered dialogue systems.
