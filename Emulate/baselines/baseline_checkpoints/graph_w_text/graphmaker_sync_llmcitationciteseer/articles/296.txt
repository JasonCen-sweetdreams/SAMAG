Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in various applications, but its vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises significant concerns. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based anomaly detection method, called GraphAAD, to detect adversarial attacks in DRL environments. GraphAAD leverages the structural relationships between states and actions to identify abnormal patterns in the agent's behavior. Our experiments on several DRL benchmarks demonstrate that GraphAAD significantly outperforms existing detection methods, achieving an average detection accuracy of 92.5%. We also provide theoretical analysis to guarantee the robustness of our approach.
