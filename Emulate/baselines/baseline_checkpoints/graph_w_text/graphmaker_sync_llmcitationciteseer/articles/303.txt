State-of-the-art neural ranking models for information retrieval often rely on complex, resource-intensive architectures. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural network (HNN) architecture that leverages both local and global contextual information to improve query-document matching. Our approach hierarchically integrates multiple encoding layers, enabling the model to capture nuanced semantic relationships between queries and documents. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in ranking accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing neural ranking models.
