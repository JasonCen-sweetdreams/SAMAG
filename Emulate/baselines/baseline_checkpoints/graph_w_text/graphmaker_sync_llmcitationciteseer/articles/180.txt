Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task in image analysis, but its scalability is limited by the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'DeepHier', which leverages deep embeddings to efficiently cluster large-scale image datasets. We introduce a hierarchical clustering algorithm that iteratively applies a deep neural network to reduce the dimensionality of the data, enabling the clustering of millions of images. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that DeepHier achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance while reducing computational complexity by up to 90% compared to existing methods.
