The ever-growing scale and dynamics of modern document collections pose significant challenges to traditional information retrieval (IR) systems. This paper introduces ElasticRank, a novel ranking framework that adapts to changing document collections by leveraging incremental learning and hierarchical clustering. We propose a robust and efficient ranking model that incorporates document similarity, query context, and relevance feedback to improve retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC Dynamic Domain Benchmark demonstrate that ElasticRank outperforms state-of-the-art IR methods in terms of precision, recall, and computational efficiency.
