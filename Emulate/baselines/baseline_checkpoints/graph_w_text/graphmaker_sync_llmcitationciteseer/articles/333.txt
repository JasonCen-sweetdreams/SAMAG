Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of users with dyslexia. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing accessible conversational interfaces that accommodate the unique challenges faced by users with dyslexia. We conducted a comprehensive study involving 30 participants with dyslexia, identifying three key areas of difficulty: text comprehension, speech recognition errors, and navigation complexity. Our proposed design framework, 'DyslexiaAware', incorporates multimodal input, personalized feedback, and simplified dialogue flows to improve user experience and task completion rates. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in user satisfaction and task efficiency compared to existing conversational interfaces.
