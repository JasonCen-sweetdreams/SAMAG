Conversational search systems aim to provide more natural and interactive search experiences. However, existing retrieval models often struggle to capture the nuances of conversational queries. This paper presents a novel hybrid retrieval model, 'IntentEx', which integrates a traditional keyword-based approach with a neural intent-aware query expansion component. IntentEx leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify relevant intent cues in the conversation history and generates expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on a large-scale conversational search dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and user satisfaction.
