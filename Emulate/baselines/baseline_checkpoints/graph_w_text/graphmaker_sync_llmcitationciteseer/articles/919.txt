Traditional query expansion techniques often rely on term co-occurrence or frequency-based methods, which may not capture the nuanced relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a graph-based approach, 'GraphEx', which leverages graph convolutional networks to learn context-aware embeddings for queries and documents. By modeling the query-document relationships as a graph, GraphEx can effectively capture semantic and syntactic dependencies, leading to improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of GraphEx in enhancing the search engine's ranking quality and retrieval accuracy.
