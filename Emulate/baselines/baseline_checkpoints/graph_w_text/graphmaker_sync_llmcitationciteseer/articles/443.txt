Few-shot learning has gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing methods focus on single-label classification. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for multi-label few-shot learning. HGAT leverages graph neural networks to model label relationships and attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant labels. We introduce a hierarchical label embedding strategy that captures label semantics at multiple granularities, enabling effective knowledge transfer between labels. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-label few-shot learning scenarios.
