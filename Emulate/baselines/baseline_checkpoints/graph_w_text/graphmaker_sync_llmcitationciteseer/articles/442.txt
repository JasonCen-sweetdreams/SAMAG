The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential increase in data streams, making real-time query optimization a pressing challenge. This paper presents 'HyperOpt', a novel approach that leverages hypergraph partitioning to efficiently distribute query processing across a cluster of machines. By representing data streams as hypergraphs, we can identify and optimize critical query patterns, reducing latency by up to 70% compared to existing methods. We evaluate HyperOpt on a large-scale IoT dataset, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness in handling high-velocity and high-volume data streams.
