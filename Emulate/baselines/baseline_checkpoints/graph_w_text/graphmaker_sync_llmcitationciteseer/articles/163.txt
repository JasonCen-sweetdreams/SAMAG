Individuals with motor impairments often face significant challenges when interacting with computers. This paper presents EyeGazeType, a novel gaze-based typing system that enables users to type efficiently and accurately using only their eye movements. Our approach leverages a combination of machine learning and computer vision techniques to detect and recognize gaze patterns, allowing users to select characters and compose sentences. We evaluate EyeGazeType through a user study with 15 participants, demonstrating an average typing speed of 15 words per minute with an error rate of less than 5%. The results show promising applications for EyeGazeType in facilitating communication and enhancing quality of life for individuals with motor impairments.
