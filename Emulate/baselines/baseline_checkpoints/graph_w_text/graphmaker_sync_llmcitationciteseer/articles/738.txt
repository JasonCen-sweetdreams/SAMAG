Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging problem in information retrieval, especially when dealing with complex, multi-faceted queries. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, Hierarchical Relevance Matcher (HRM), which leverages a hierarchical query reconstruction mechanism to better capture the semantic relationships between query components. Our approach uses a deep relevance matching scheme that adaptively weighs the importance of different query aspects based on their contextual relevance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art models, with HRM achieving a 12.4% increase in NDCG@10.
