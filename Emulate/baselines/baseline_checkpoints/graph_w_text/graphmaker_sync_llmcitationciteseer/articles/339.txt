Traditional ranking models in information retrieval (IR) often rely on handcrafted features and static query representations, limiting their adaptability to diverse query types and document collections. This paper introduces Neural Query Graphs (NQG), a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks to model query-document interactions. NQG learns to adaptively represent queries as graphs, capturing complex semantic relationships between query terms and entities. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art ranking models.
