Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years. However, most existing methods suffer from high computational complexity, making them unsuitable for large-scale industrial applications. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that leverages both user and item embeddings to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. Our approach reduces the computational complexity of explanation generation by 3x compared to state-of-the-art methods while achieving comparable recommendation accuracy on benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in real-world scenarios using a large-scale e-commerce dataset.
