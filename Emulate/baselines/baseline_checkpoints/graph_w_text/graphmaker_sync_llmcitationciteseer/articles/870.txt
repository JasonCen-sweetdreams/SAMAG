Query expansion is a crucial step in improving the retrieval performance of ad-hoc search systems. This paper proposes a novel neural re-ranking approach, 'NeuQE', which leverages a transformer-based architecture to model the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. We demonstrate that NeuQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as Rocchio and RM3, by effectively capturing nuanced context-dependent relationships. Furthermore, we show that NeuQE can be easily integrated into existing retrieval systems, yielding significant improvements in mean average precision and NDCG@10.
