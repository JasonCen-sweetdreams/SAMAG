Few-shot learning has gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods often struggle with adapting to novel classes and distances. This paper proposes a hierarchical few-shot learning framework, 'HiFSL', which leverages meta-learning to adaptively learn distance metrics at multiple levels of abstraction. By learning to weigh and combine different distance metrics, HiFSL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, including mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling unseen classes and increasing robustness to noisy data.
