With the proliferation of cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms, efficient query optimization has become a critical challenge. This paper presents a novel distributed query optimization framework, 'DQOpt', designed for multi-tenant DBaaS environments. DQOpt leverages a hierarchical, graph-based representation of the query optimization search space, allowing for parallel exploration of alternative query plans. We develop a novel, delay-sensitive cost model that incorporates tenant-specific workload characteristics, enabling more accurate optimization decisions. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing optimization techniques.
