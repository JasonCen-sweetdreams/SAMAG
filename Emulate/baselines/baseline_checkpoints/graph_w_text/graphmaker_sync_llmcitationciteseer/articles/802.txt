Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a challenging task due to the complexity of distributed query planning and execution. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query performance in DDS. We design an RL agent that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the system's state and query workload. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 40% in terms of query execution time.
