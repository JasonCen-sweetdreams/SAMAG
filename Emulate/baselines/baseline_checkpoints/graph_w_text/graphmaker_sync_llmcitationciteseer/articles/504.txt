Multi-tenant database systems have gained popularity due to their ability to efficiently manage and scale resources. However, query processing remains a significant challenge, as it requires balancing performance, isolation, and fairness across tenants. This paper proposes a novel query processing framework, 'QTune', which leverages a combination of query rewriting, indexing, and caching techniques to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. We evaluate QTune on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing approaches, while ensuring strong isolation and fairness guarantees.
