Multi-agent systems often require efficient task allocation to achieve collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). Our algorithm, called DCA-MA, leverages local constraint propagation and asynchronous communication to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. We prove that DCA-MA converges to a near-optimal solution with probabilistic guarantees and evaluate its performance using a real-world disaster response scenario. Experimental results show that DCA-MA outperforms centralized approaches in terms of solution quality and scalability.
