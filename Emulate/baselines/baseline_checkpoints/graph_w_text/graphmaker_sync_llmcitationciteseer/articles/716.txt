Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in smart homes, but their usability for older adults remains largely unexplored. This study investigates the experiences of older adults (65+ years) interacting with voice assistants, identifying pain points and areas for improvement. Through a mixed-methods approach combining surveys, interviews, and usability testing, we uncover significant barriers to adoption, including difficulties with voice recognition, navigation, and understanding system feedback. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating more inclusive voice assistants, emphasizing clear and simple language, personalized feedback, and tailored functionality for older adults.
