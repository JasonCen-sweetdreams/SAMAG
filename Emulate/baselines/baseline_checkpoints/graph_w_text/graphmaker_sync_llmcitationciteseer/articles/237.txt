Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their conversational errors can be frustrating and exclusionary, particularly for older adults. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating how older adults perceive and respond to conversational errors in voice assistants. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews and a usability study with 30 participants aged 65-85, using a custom-built voice assistant with controlled error rates. Our findings highlight the importance of error transparency, polite language, and adaptive error recovery strategies to promote trust and inclusivity. We propose a set of design guidelines for more accessible and empathetic voice assistants.
