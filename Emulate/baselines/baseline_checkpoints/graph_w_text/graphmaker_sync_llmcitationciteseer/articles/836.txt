Virtual reality (VR) technology has seen significant advancements, but interaction methods remain limited. This paper presents an in-depth study on gaze-based interaction for VR, focusing on user experience and performance. We design and implement a custom VR system incorporating a gaze-tracking camera and evaluate its usability through a user study. Our results show that gaze-based interaction significantly reduces task completion time and improves user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based methods. We also identify key factors influencing user performance, including gaze accuracy, visual attention, and cognitive load.
