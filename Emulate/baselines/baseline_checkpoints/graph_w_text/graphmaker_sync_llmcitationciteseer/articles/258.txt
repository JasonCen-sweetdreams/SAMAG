Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the lives of older adults, but existing interfaces often exclude this demographic due to physical and cognitive limitations. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create inclusive VR interfaces for older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify design requirements and preferences. Our results show that older adults prefer intuitive, voice-based interactions and clear, high-contrast visual cues. We developed and evaluated a VR prototype incorporating these design principles, achieving significant improvements in user engagement and task performance compared to existing VR interfaces.
