This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for multi-modal time series forecasting. HGAT leverages the strengths of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model complex dependencies between time series variables. Our approach involves constructing a hierarchical graph representation of the data, where nodes correspond to variables and edges capture their pairwise correlations. We then apply a stacked attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges at each level of the hierarchy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency.
