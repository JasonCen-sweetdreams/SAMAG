Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with caregivers, healthcare professionals, and older adults to identify key design requirements. Our proposed VR system incorporates cognitive support tools, personalized interfaces, and emotionally engaging content to promote user engagement and accessibility. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving user experience and reducing cognitive load.
