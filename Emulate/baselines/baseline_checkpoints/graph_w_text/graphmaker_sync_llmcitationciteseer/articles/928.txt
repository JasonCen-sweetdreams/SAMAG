Query optimization is a critical component of database management systems, especially in distributed settings where data is scattered across multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that learns to select optimal query plans based on runtime statistics and system feedback. Experimental results on a TPC-DS dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while ensuring efficient resource utilization.
