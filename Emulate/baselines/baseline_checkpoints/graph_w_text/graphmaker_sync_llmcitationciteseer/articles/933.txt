Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but users often struggle with spatial awareness and presence in virtual environments. This paper investigates the effect of vibrotactile feedback on user experience in VR. We designed a series of experiments using a custom-built VR platform that incorporates vibrotactile actuators in the controllers. Our results show that vibrotactile feedback significantly improves users' sense of presence and reduces spatial disorientation. We also found that the type and frequency of vibrations affect user performance in VR tasks. Our findings have implications for the design of more immersive and effective VR systems.
