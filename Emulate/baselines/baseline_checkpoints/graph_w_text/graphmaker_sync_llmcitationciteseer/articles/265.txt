Virtual reality (VR) has shown immense potential in various fields, but user anxiety remains a significant barrier to its widespread adoption. This study investigates the effectiveness of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in reducing user anxiety in VR environments. We designed and implemented an ECA-based system that utilizes multimodal cues to provide emotional support and guidance to users. Our user study involving 40 participants reveals that the ECA system significantly reduces user anxiety and improves overall VR experience. We also identify key design factors that influence the anxiety-reducing effect of ECAs, providing valuable insights for the development of anxiety-mitigating VR systems.
