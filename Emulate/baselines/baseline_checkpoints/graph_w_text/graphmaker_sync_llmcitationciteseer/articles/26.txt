Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complexities of patent documents and the need for precise query matching. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, HierPat, which leverages hierarchical document embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between patent documents. Our method represents documents as hierarchical graph structures, allowing for more effective capture of context and subtleties in patent language. Experimental results on a large patent corpus demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.
