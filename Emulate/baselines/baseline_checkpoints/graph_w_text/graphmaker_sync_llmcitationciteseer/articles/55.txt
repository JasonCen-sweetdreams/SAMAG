Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively retrieve relevant documents, especially for short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, which selects and integrates relevant contextual information into the original document representation. Our method, dubbed 'QueryExpan', leverages a combination of semantic role labeling and dependency parsing to identify salient entities and relationships within documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain compared to state-of-the-art retrieval models.
