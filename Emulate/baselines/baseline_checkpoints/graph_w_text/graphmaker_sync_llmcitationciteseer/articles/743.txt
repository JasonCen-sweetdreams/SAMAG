In heterogeneous multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem due to differences in agent capabilities and task requirements. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing system dynamics. Our approach, called 'HATA', uses a multi-agent Q-network to learn optimal task assignments based on agent capabilities, task priorities, and system constraints. We evaluate HATA on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates, reduced communication overhead, and enhanced system robustness compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
