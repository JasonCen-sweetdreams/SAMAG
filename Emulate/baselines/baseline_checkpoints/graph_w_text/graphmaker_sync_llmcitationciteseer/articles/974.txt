Recent advances in neuroimaging have generated large-scale, multi-modal datasets that require effective analysis techniques. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture for integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural MRI, and electroencephalography (EEG) data. HGAT leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant graph structures and modalities, enabling the discovery of complex brain connectivity patterns. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale neuroimaging dataset and demonstrate improved performance in predicting cognitive task outcomes compared to existing multi-modal fusion methods.
