Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing environments, but they pose significant query optimization challenges. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach to efficiently optimize queries in multi-tenant settings. We model the database schema as a graph and leverage graph convolutional networks to predict the optimal query plan. Our approach reduces the query optimization time by up to 50% compared to traditional cost-based optimization methods, while maintaining comparable query performance. We evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the overall system throughput.
