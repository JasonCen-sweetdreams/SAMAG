Distributed database systems with heterogeneous storage configurations have become increasingly prevalent in modern data centers. However, optimizing query performance in such environments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'HeteroOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost modeling and dynamic plan refinement to adapt to diverse storage characteristics. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that HeteroOpt achieves significant improvements in query response time and throughput compared to traditional optimization techniques.
