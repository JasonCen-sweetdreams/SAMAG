Virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) have become increasingly popular, but their security remains a concern. This paper presents a novel gaze-based authentication mechanism for VR HMDs, leveraging the high-resolution eye-tracking capabilities of modern devices. Our approach, 'GazeAuth', uses machine learning to classify user gaze patterns and detect authentication attempts. We conducted a user study with 30 participants and achieved an accuracy of 95.6% in distinguishing between genuine and impostor attempts. GazeAuth offers a convenient, non-intrusive, and highly secure authentication solution for VR HMDs, ensuring a safe and immersive user experience.
