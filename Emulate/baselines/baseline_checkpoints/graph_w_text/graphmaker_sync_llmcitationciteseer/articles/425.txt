Distributed relational databases are increasingly used to handle large-scale data processing. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to tune query execution plans in real-time. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query performance by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query latency. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
