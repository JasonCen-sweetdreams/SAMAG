Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data centers, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize query plans. We design a DRL agent that learns to select efficient query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution times. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
