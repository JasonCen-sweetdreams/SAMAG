Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complexity and nuance of patent language. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural embeddings to improve retrieval accuracy. We propose a two-stage framework, where a neural query expansion model generates semantically related terms and a learning-to-rank model re-ranks the expanded query to optimize retrieval performance. Experimental results on the PatentIR dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision. The proposed framework is scalable and can be easily integrated into existing patent retrieval systems.
