Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, as graph sizes continue to grow, query processing efficiency becomes a major bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel parallelized subgraph matching algorithm, 'ParaMatch', which exploits the inherent parallelism in modern processors to accelerate query execution. We develop a dynamic task scheduling strategy that adaptively assigns subgraph matching tasks to available processing units, minimizing idle time and maximizing throughput. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that ParaMatch achieves up to 5x speedup over state-of-the-art sequential algorithms, making it an attractive solution for large-scale graph query processing.
