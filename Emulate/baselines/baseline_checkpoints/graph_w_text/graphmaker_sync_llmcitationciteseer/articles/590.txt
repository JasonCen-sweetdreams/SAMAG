Optimizing query execution plans is crucial for efficient data retrieval in distributed relational databases. Traditional cost-based optimization techniques often fall short in handling complex query patterns and dynamic workloads. This paper presents RLOpt, a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select optimal plans. RLOpt utilizes a deep Q-network to learn from query execution histories and explores the vast plan space to minimize latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate that RLOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query response time.
