Augmented reality (AR) technology has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with digital information. However, existing input methods, such as touch-based interfaces, can be limiting and cumbersome. This paper explores the use of gaze-based interaction as a novel input modality for AR applications. We designed and evaluated a gaze-based interface using a wearable AR device and conducted a user study to assess its usability, performance, and user experience. Our results show that gaze-based interaction can significantly reduce task completion time and improve user satisfaction compared to traditional input methods, highlighting its potential for future AR applications.
