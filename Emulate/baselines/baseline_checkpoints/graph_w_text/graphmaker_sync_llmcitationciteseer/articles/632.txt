Multi-core database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but efficient query processing remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel adaptive buffer management strategy, called 'ABMS', which dynamically allocates buffer space to optimize query performance. ABMS leverages a machine learning model to predict query access patterns and adapts to changing workloads. Our extensive experimental evaluation on a real-world database benchmark demonstrates that ABMS achieves significant improvements in query response time and throughput compared to state-of-the-art buffer management approaches.
