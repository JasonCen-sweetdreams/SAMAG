Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on rule-based or cost-based optimization, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-Opt', that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select the most efficient execution plans. We design a Markov decision process to model the query optimization problem and develop a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
