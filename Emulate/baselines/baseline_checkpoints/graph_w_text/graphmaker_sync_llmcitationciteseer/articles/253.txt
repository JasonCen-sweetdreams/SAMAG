Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, where the goal is to reformulate the user's query to better match the relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using reinforcement learning. We frame the query expansion problem as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to select the most informative terms to add to the query. Our agent is trained using a reward function that balances the trade-off between precision and recall. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and reciprocal rank.
