Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval, but traditional methods often fail to capture the nuances of user intent. This paper proposes Aspect-Aware Query Expansion (AAQE), a novel framework that incorporates aspect-based sentiment analysis to disambiguate query terms. We leverage a deep learning model to identify relevant aspects in the query and then expand the query with aspect-specific terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, improving mean average precision by up to 15%.
