Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning. While meta-learning has shown promise, existing methods often rely on simplistic task embeddings that fail to capture the nuances of novel tasks. This paper proposes a deep meta-learning framework that learns task-aware embeddings through a novel graph neural network architecture. Our approach leverages self-supervised learning to adapt to new tasks and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on popular few-shot benchmarks. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method, revealing its connections to existing meta-learning techniques.
