Modern graph databases are increasingly used to store massive amounts of interconnected data, posing significant challenges for query optimization. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach, GraphQLearn, which leverages graph neural networks to predict optimal query execution plans. We introduce a graph embedding technique that captures structural and statistical properties of the graph, enabling the learning model to generalize across diverse query workloads. Experimental results on a real-world graph database show that GraphQLearn outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
