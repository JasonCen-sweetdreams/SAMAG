Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. Our model, called Query2Vec, learns to represent queries and documents as dense vectors, enabling semantic matching and expansion of the original query. We evaluate Query2Vec on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we show that Query2Vec can be easily integrated into existing retrieval systems, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.
