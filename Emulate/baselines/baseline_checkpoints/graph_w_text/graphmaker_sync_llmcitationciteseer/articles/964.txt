Distributed databases with heterogeneous storage systems are increasingly common, but optimizing queries in such environments remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel cost-based query optimization framework, 'HeteCost', which takes into account the diverse storage characteristics and access patterns of different devices. We develop a probabilistic modeling approach to estimate the cost of query execution plans, and introduce a dynamic reordering strategy to minimize data transfer and processing overhead. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database setup demonstrate that HeteCost achieves up to 3x improvement in query response time compared to existing optimization techniques.
