Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it helps to overcome the vocabulary mismatch between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel neural embedding-based approach for query expansion, which leverages the semantic relationships between words to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our method uses a graph convolutional network to learn dense vector representations of words, which are then used to compute the similarity between the original query terms and candidate expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance.
