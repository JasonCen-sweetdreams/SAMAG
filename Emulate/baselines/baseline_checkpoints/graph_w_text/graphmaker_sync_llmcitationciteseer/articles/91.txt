Main-memory database systems have gained popularity due to their ability to provide high performance and low latency. However, as data sizes continue to grow, indexing mechanisms play a crucial role in ensuring query efficiency. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'AdaptiveHash', which leverages the properties of main-memory storage to provide superior query performance and scalability. Our approach dynamically adapts the index structure based on query patterns and data distribution, resulting in a significant reduction in query latency and memory usage. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaptiveHash in comparison to existing indexing techniques.
