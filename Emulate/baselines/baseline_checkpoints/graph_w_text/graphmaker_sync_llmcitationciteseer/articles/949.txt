Deep neural ranking models have shown promising results in document retrieval tasks, but their performance can be limited by the quality of the input queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages semantic relationships between query terms to generate more informative and context-aware queries. Our approach uses a combination of word embeddings and graph-based methods to identify relevant expansion terms, which are then incorporated into a neural ranking model. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the retrieval performance of state-of-the-art neural ranking models, especially for ambiguous and underspecified queries.
