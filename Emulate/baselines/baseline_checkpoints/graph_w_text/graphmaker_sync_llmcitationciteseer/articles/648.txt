Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in knowledge graph construction, but existing methods suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large-scale datasets. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'EDIndex', that enables efficient entity disambiguation by leveraging a combination of graph-based and semantic features. Our approach uses a hierarchical indexing structure to prune the search space, reducing the number of candidate entities to be disambiguated. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EDIndex outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and runtime performance.
