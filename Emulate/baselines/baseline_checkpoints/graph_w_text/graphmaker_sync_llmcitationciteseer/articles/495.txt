Query intent discovery is a crucial task in information retrieval (IR), as it enables search engines to return more relevant results. This paper proposes a novel deep ranking model, 'DiverseIntent', which leverages a combination of semantic and intent-based features to improve query intent discovery. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures diverse intent aspects, such as entity, attribute, and action, and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying underlying query intents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DiverseIntent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of intent discovery accuracy and relevance ranking quality.
