Students with learning disabilities (LD) often face emotional challenges in online educational environments. This paper introduces EARL, a novel affective computing framework that integrates multimodal emotion recognition with personalized learning recommendations. Our approach leverages facial expression analysis, sentiment analysis of chat logs, and learning behavior modeling to detect early signs of frustration or anxiety. EARL then adapts the learning content, pace, and feedback to promote emotional regulation and engagement. A user study with 50 LD students shows that EARL improves learning outcomes, reduces anxiety, and enhances overall user experience.
