Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for timely business intelligence. However, maintaining materialized views in the presence of high-volume updates poses significant scalability challenges. This paper presents 'RTView', a novel incremental view maintenance approach that leverages a combination of data striding, partial aggregation, and parallel processing to achieve near real-time view refresh. We demonstrate RTView's effectiveness through extensive experiments on a large-scale data warehousing benchmark, showing orders-of-magnitude performance improvements over conventional view maintenance techniques.
