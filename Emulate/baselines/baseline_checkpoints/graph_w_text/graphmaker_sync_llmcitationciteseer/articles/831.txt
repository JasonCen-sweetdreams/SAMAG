Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to enrich the original query to improve retrieval performance. Traditional approaches rely on term co-occurrence and statistical methods, which may not capture complex semantic relationships. This paper proposes a deep neural network-based approach, dubbed 'NeuroQE', that learns to generate effective expanded queries from large-scale IR datasets. NeuroQE leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively incorporate relevant terms from the document collection, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets.
