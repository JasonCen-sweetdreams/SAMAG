Autonomous vehicles require real-time decision-making capabilities to navigate complex environments. This paper presents 'RT-RL', a novel deep reinforcement learning framework optimized for real-time autonomous driving. We introduce a hierarchical policy architecture that leverages model-based and model-free learning to balance exploration and exploitation. Our approach incorporates a customized reward function that prioritizes safety, efficiency, and smoothness. Experimental results on a high-fidelity driving simulator demonstrate that RT-RL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of response time, fuel efficiency, and overall driving quality.
