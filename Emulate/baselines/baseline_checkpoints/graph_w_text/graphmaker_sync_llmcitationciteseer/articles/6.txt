Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck in these systems. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing technique, 'AIQ', which dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distributions. AIQ leverages machine learning algorithms to predict query hotspots and optimize indexing structures accordingly. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AIQ achieves up to 30% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in storage overhead compared to traditional indexing techniques.
