Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interaction designs often neglect users with speech disabilities, such as dysarthria. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create personalized voice assistants for individuals with dysarthria. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with dysarthria, identifying key challenges and preferences in voice interaction. Our proposed framework, 'VoiceAdapt', incorporates acoustic and linguistic adaptation, as well as user profiling, to improve recognition accuracy and interaction experience. A pilot study demonstrates significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates compared to existing voice assistants.
