Query expansion is a crucial step in natural language search, where the goal is to reformulate the original query to retrieve more relevant documents. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages the semantic relationships between words to generate effective query expansions. NeuroQE consists of a word embeddings layer, a recurrent neural network, and a scoring function to rank potential expansions. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in search performance compared to traditional query expansion techniques, while maintaining efficiency and scalability.
