This process is typically time-consuming and computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale problems. We propose a novel approach, 'HyperBO', which leverages Bayesian optimization to efficiently search for optimal hyperparameters in DRL. By adopting a surrogate-based model and an acquisition function tailored to DRL's unique characteristics, HyperBO significantly reduces the number of evaluations required to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results on various Atari games and robotic control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

This paper proposes a novel Bayesian neural pruning approach, 'BayesPrune', to robustify deep neural networks against such attacks. BayesPrune iteratively prunes the network based on Bayesian uncertainty estimates, removing redundant or vulnerable neurons. We demonstrate that BayesPrune achieves state-of-the-art robustness against various attack types, including PGD and CW attacks, while maintaining accuracy on clean data. Our approach can be integrated with existing defense mechanisms, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.",

This study investigates the effect of anthropomorphic cues, such as facial expressions and body language, on user trust in VAs. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 120 participants, using a custom-built VA platform with varying levels of anthropomorphism. Results show that subtle anthropomorphic cues can significantly enhance user trust and perceived reliability, particularly among users with lower technology proficiency. However, overt anthropomorphism can lead to decreased trust due to perceived artificiality. Implications for VA design and future research directions are discussed.",

However, existing indexing techniques suffer from high memory overhead and slow query performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, Hierarchical Bloom Filter Index (HBFI), which leverages the hierarchical structure of Bloom filters to efficiently index temporal graphs. HBFI reduces memory usage by up to 70% and improves query performance by up to 5x compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques. We evaluate HBFI on real-world datasets and demonstrate its applicability to various temporal graph queries.",

Our results show that personalization can lead to increased satisfaction and trust, but also decreases users' perceived control and autonomy. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of voice assistants and propose a framework for balancing personalization with user agency.",

We introduce a trainable attention module that focuses on suspicious nodes and edges, allowing the model to distinguish between genuine and tampered graph data. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate that GAT-Guard outperforms existing defense methods in detecting adversarial attacks with high accuracy and efficiency.",

Unfortunately, this process is often time-consuming and computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian optimization framework, 'HyperBO', which leverages a probabilistic search strategy to efficiently identify optimal hyperparameters. We introduce a new acquisition function that adaptively balances exploration and exploitation, leading to faster convergence and improved performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperBO outperforms existing tuning methods, including grid search and random search, while requiring significantly less computational resources.",

We introduce a novel cost model that accurately estimates the execution time of range queries and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that Hyperion achieves an average speedup of 3.2x over state-of-the-art query optimization methods.",

This paper investigates the role of embodiment in virtual environments on human-robot collaboration. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, who interacted with a robot in a virtual environment with varying levels of embodiment. Our results show that increased embodiment leads to improved collaboration outcomes, including reduced task completion time and increased user satisfaction. We also found that users' perceived trust in the robot and their sense of presence in the virtual environment are significant predictors of collaboration success. The implications of our findings for the design of virtual human-robot collaboration systems are discussed.",

This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that integrates facial expression, speech, and physiological signals to recognize emotions. Our HAN model consists of three stages: modality-specific attention, multimodal fusion, and hierarchical attention. We evaluate our approach on the SEMAINE dataset and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multimodal data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our model to variations in lighting conditions and individual differences.",

This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent coordination framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn cooperative policies. Our approach, called 'GNN-Swarm', represents the swarm as a dynamic graph, where each vehicle is a node, and GNNs are used to learn node representations and edge weights. We introduce a novel message-passing scheme that enables vehicles to communicate and adapt to changing swarm configurations. Experiments on a simulated urban environment show that GNN-Swarm outperforms traditional rule-based and centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and collision avoidance.",

However, centralized approaches are often limited by scalability and robustness issues. This paper presents a decentralized autonomous system (DAS) that enables agents to self-organize and adapt to dynamic environments. We propose a novel negotiation protocol that leverages machine learning-based preference modeling and iterative bargaining to allocate resources efficiently.

This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism, called 'Distributed Auction for Task Allocation' (DATA), which enables autonomous agents to bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We theoretically analyze the properties of DATA, including its incentive compatibility and allocative efficiency, and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations on a variety of task allocation scenarios. Our results show that DATA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of both task completion time and agent satisfaction.",

However, most existing approaches treat each modality separately or rely on early fusion, neglecting the complex interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and their interactions. Our HAN model consists of two stages: intra-modal attention and inter-modal attention, enabling the capture of both local and global dependencies. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSI and ICT-MMM datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 5.3% improvement in sentiment prediction accuracy.",

Traditional sparse retrieval methods rely on bag-of-words representations, which ignore the semantic relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'SparseNRM', that leverages pre-trained language models to capture the contextualized semantic meaning of query terms. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weights the importance of each query term based on its relevance to the document. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that SparseNRM outperforms state-of-the-art sparse retrieval methods by a significant margin, achieving higher mean average precision and recall.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of GACE in a variety of multi-agent environments, including robotic swarms and smart traffic management, and show improved performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

This paper presents a novel approach to cooperative task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP).

Our experiments on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that ColIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 5x in query latency and 3x in storage efficiency.",

This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism for task allocation, where agents bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences.

Experimental results on the SQuAD dataset demonstrate that QADE outperforms state-of-the-art ODQA systems by 3.5% in terms of exact match score.",

This paper presents a novel approach to design inclusive voice assistants that can better understand and respond to users with dysarthria. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to gather speech patterns and develop a customized acoustic model that improves recognition accuracy by 35%. We also designed an adaptive dialogue system that adjusts its response time and feedback based on the user's speech characteristics. Our results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the user experience and interaction success rate for individuals with dysarthria.",

Our results show that personalized VR experiences lead to increased user engagement, but only when personalized elements are relevant to the user's interests. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing more engaging VR experiences and highlight areas for future research.",

Our approach reduces the number of nodes to be queried, resulting in significant performance improvements for graph traversal and pattern matching queries. Experimental evaluation on real-world graph datasets demonstrates that HBF-G outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of storage efficiency.",
