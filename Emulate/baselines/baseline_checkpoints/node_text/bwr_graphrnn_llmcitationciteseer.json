This paper proposes a novel Bayesian optimization framework, 'BO-Reinforce', which efficiently tunes hyperparameters for DRL algorithms. By leveraging the probabilistic nature of Bayesian optimization, BO-Reinforce adaptively adjusts the search space and explores the most promising regions. Experimental results on several benchmark tasks demonstrate that BO-Reinforce significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both optimization efficiency and final performance, while requiring minimal domain knowledge and human intervention.",

However, most existing approaches rely on simplistic feature attribution methods, neglecting complex user-item relationships.

HiGAT leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant user and item features, generating explanations in the form of feature importance scores. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.",

This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the adversarial robustness of DRL agents by incorporating uncertainty-aware policy regularization. We introduce a new regularization term that encourages the policy to be more cautious in regions of high uncertainty, thereby reducing the attack surface. Experimental results on several benchmark environments demonstrate that our method significantly improves the robustness of DRL agents against a range of adversarial attacks, while maintaining their performance in the absence of attacks.",

The framework, called MATRA, models the interactions between agents as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process. MATRA uses a hybrid approach that combines centralized planning with decentralized execution, enabling efficient allocation of tasks to agents in real-time.

Evaluations on a dataset of 100 participants demonstrate EmoGlass's ability to accurately recognize five emotional states (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise) with a mean F1-score of 0.83.",

Our results show that embodiment significantly enhances social presence, and that this effect is moderated by individual differences in anthropomorphism and spatial awareness.

This paper presents a participatory design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant that caters to this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify usability challenges and preferences. Our findings inform the development of 'ElderVoice', a voice assistant that incorporates adaptive speech recognition, personalized prompts, and multimodal output.

This paper explores the potential of gaze-based interaction for AR, focusing on user experience and performance. We designed and implemented a gaze-based AR system and conducted a user study with 24 participants.

In this paper, we propose a neural query expansion (NQE) approach to enhance the retrieval performance of DPR models. Our NQE framework leverages a combination of semantic and syntactic features to generate expanded queries, which are then used to re-rank the retrieved passages. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the retrieval effectiveness of DPR models, especially for complex and multi-hop questions.",

However, the security of user authentication in VR environments remains a significant concern. This paper investigates the effectiveness of gesture-based authentication in VR, focusing on the trade-off between security and usability. We designed and implemented a gesture-based authentication system, 'VR-GestureAuth', and evaluated its performance with 30 participants. Our results show that VR-GestureAuth achieves a high authentication accuracy of 95.6% while maintaining a relatively low false rejection rate of 12.5%. Furthermore, our user study reveals that participants prefer gesture-based authentication over traditional password-based methods in VR environments.",

Our approach, called Hierarchical Task Assignment and Coordination (HTAC), employs a two-level hierarchy of agents: high-level task managers and low-level skill executors. Task managers learn to assign tasks to skill executors based on their capabilities and the current environment, while skill executors learn to execute tasks using reinforcement learning. We evaluate HTAC in a simulated robotics domain and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced coordination overhead compared to flat, non-hierarchical approaches.",

This paper proposes a novel approach that combines query rewriting and path indexing to optimize data retrieval in distributed database systems.

We propose a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework that leverages a two-level abstraction to balance exploration and exploitation. The high-level policy focuses on strategic decision-making, while the low-level policy executes tactical control actions. We introduce a novel experience replay mechanism that adaptively samples transitions based on their relevance to the current state, reducing the need for large-scale exploration.

This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HierDrone', which integrates a high-level mission planner with a low-level motion controller. The mission planner uses a graph-based representation to optimize the drone's trajectory, while the motion controller employs a deep Q-network to adapt to local environment changes. We evaluate HierDrone in a simulated urban environment and demonstrate improved navigation efficiency and robustness compared to flat reinforcement learning baselines.",

Our user study involved 30 older adults completing a series of cognitively demanding tasks with and without the ECA interface. Results show significant reductions in cognitive load, measured through eye-tracking and self-reported surveys, when the ECA interface was used. Our findings have implications for the design of accessible and inclusive interfaces for older adults.",

This study investigates the role of embodiment in shaping trust in virtual assistants. We conducted a controlled experiment with 120 participants, comparing a humanoid robot, achatbot, and a voice-only assistant. Results show that users perceive the humanoid robot as more trustworthy and likable, while the chatbot is seen as more efficient. However, we found no significant difference in task performance across conditions. Our findings have implications for the design of virtual assistants and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of embodiment in HCI.",

This paper presents a novel gaze-based authentication system, 'GazeSecure', designed specifically for VR HMDs. GazeSecure leverages the high-resolution eye-tracking capabilities of modern VR HMDs to authenticate users based on their unique gaze patterns. Our approach uses a combination of machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to analyze the user's gaze behavior and verify their identity. Experimental results show that GazeSecure achieves an accuracy of 97.5% and a false acceptance rate of 0.5%, outperforming existing authentication methods for VR HMDs.",

Experiments on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that HTM-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, with significant improvements in precision and recall.",

However, query optimization in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'MTQO', which leverages a combination of static and dynamic analysis to optimize query plans for multiple tenants. Our approach incorporates a tenant-aware cost model, a scalable optimization algorithm, and a runtime adaptation mechanism to handle diverse workload patterns.

This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'BLANT', which leverages Bayesian learning to adapt to dynamic environments. Each agent maintains a probabilistic model of task requirements and agent capabilities, and updates its model through local observations and communication with neighboring agents. We show that BLANT outperforms existing decentralized algorithms in terms of task completion rate and communication overhead. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of BLANT in adapting to changing task priorities and agent availability.",

This paper investigates attacks on DRL policies with temporal logic specifications, which specify constraints on the behavior of the agent. We propose a novel attack framework, 'TL-Attack', that crafts perturbations to the environment such that the policy violates the temporal logic specifications. Our experiments on several DRL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TL-Attack in inducing undesired behavior. We also propose a defense mechanism based on adversarial training with temporal logic regularization, which significantly improves the robustness of DRL policies.",

        "paper_abstract": "Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their accessibility limitations persist, excluding individuals with disabilities. This paper presents a multimodal framework, 'IncluVA', which integrates computer vision, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction principles to create a more inclusive voice assistant. We propose a novel gesture recognition system that enables users to interact with the assistant using sign language, and a personalized error correction mechanism that adapts to individual users' speech patterns. Our user study with participants with disabilities demonstrates significant improvements in accessibility, usability, and user satisfaction.",

This paper introduces QFNR, a neural retrieval model that incorporates query-focused attention mechanisms to selectively retrieve passages most likely to contain the answer. Our approach leverages a hierarchical encoder to jointly model query-document interactions and passage-level relevance. Experimental results on the Natural Questions benchmark demonstrate that QFNR significantly outperforms existing retrieval methods, achieving a 12.1% improvement in top-1 passage retrieval accuracy.",

We propose 'RTOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages a combination of machine learning-based cost estimation and dynamic reordering of query operators to minimize response time. Our approach takes into account DDS-specific characteristics, such as node heterogeneity and network latency, to optimize query execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that RTOpt reduces average query response time by up to 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.",

Our approach leverages a hierarchical graph-based structure to model interactions between objects, regions, and questions.
