This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that enables explainable cooperation among multiple agents. HGAT learns to represent agents as nodes in a hierarchical graph, where attention mechanisms are applied to model complex relationships between agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in a variety of cooperative scenarios, including robot soccer and disaster response. Our results show that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task performance and provides interpretable insights into agent decision-making.",

This paper addresses this issue by proposing an efficient index pruning method, which reduces the number of passages to be ranked without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. Our approach leverages the clustering structure of the passage representations and the locality-sensitive hashing to identify and remove redundant passages in the index. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant speedup and memory reduction while maintaining the retrieval performance of the original dense passage retrieval model.",

However, they often struggle with complex or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query reformulation approach, 'QR-NRM', which leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) to iteratively refine and expand the original query. Our method incorporates a relevance-based reward function to guide the GAN, ensuring that the reformulated queries better capture the user's information need. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset show that QR-NRM significantly outperforms existing NRM architectures, particularly for queries with low lexical overlap with relevant documents.",

This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, dubbed 'AVTAR', to allocate tasks among autonomous vehicles in real-time. AVTAR leverages a graph neural network to model vehicle interactions and a hierarchical deep Q-network to learn optimal task assignments. Our experiments on a simulated urban environment demonstrate that AVTAR outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion rate, latency, and adaptability to changing traffic conditions.",

However, optimizing query performance in DDS is a challenging task due to the complexities of resource allocation. This paper proposes an adaptive resource allocation framework, 'ARAF', that dynamically adjusts resource allocation based on query workload and system dynamics. ARAF uses a reinforcement learning approach to optimize query performance, reducing average query latency by up to 30% compared to existing static resource allocation strategies. Our evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of ARAF in improving query performance and system throughput.",

We conducted a series of workshops and usability studies to identify key design principles and features that support cognitive accessibility in AR interfaces. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and multimodal feedback in AR design, and demonstrate the feasibility of co-designing AR interfaces with older adults.",

Our method uses a convolutional neural network to learn a dense representation of words and their contexts, which are then used to generate expanded queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and reciprocal rank.",

This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to optimize resource allocation in cloud data centers. We design a hierarchical DRL framework that integrates a high-level resource manager with low-level controller agents, enabling adaptive resource provisioning and workload scheduling. Experimental results on a real-world cloud infrastructure show that our approach achieves up to 30% energy savings and 25% reduction in response times compared to state-of-the-art heuristics.",

Traditional methods rely on manual rules or supervised learning, which may not generalize well to diverse query patterns. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach, 'RL-Reform', that learns to reformulate queries by interacting with a simulated search engine environment. We design a novel reward function that balances the trade-off between query similarity and relevance improvement. Experimental results on a large-scale query log dataset demonstrate that RL-Reform outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of search engine efficiency and user satisfaction.",

Existing approaches often struggle with scalability and incremental updates, leading to poor performance on large, dynamic knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding method, 'GraphED', which leverages incremental clustering to efficiently disambiguate entities. By representing entities as graph embeddings and clustering them based on similarity, GraphED achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while supporting incremental updates and handling large-scale knowledge graphs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GraphED in resolving entity ambiguities.",

We model the grid as a decentralized system consisting of autonomous agents, each responsible for managing a subset of resources. The agents learn to cooperate through a novel, graph-based communication mechanism that enables the exchange of local information. Our approach is evaluated on a realistic simulation platform, demonstrating improved efficiency and resilience in the face of uncertain demand and supply patterns. We show that the proposed method outperforms traditional, centralized optimization techniques in terms of both resource utilization and response time.",

Our system, ' GestureAdapt', incorporates a user-centered design approach, involving participatory design and co-creation with users to ensure that the system is accessible, usable, and meets their needs. We evaluate GestureAdapt with a user study involving 20 participants with mobility and dexterity impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction.",
