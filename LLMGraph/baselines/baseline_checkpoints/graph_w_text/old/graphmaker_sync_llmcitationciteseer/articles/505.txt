Query expansion is a crucial step in improving the effectiveness of semantic search systems. However, existing approaches often struggle to disambiguate entities with similar names, leading to suboptimal expansion terms. This paper proposes a novel neural entity disambiguation model, 'NeuroED', which leverages contextualized embeddings and graph-based attention to accurately identify the intended entity. We integrate NeuroED with a semantic search framework and evaluate its performance on a benchmark dataset. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision.
