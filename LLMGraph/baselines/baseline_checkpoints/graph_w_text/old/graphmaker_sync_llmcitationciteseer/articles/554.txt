Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but individuals with disabilities often face significant barriers when interacting with these systems. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating accessible conversational interfaces, focusing on the needs of individuals with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive disabilities. We propose a novel framework that combines natural language processing, machine learning, and inclusive design principles to provide personalized accommodations and support. Our evaluation with 30 participants with disabilities demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates, user satisfaction, and overall accessibility.
