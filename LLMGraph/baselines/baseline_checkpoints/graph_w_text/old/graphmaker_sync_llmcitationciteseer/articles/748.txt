Distributed database systems (DDS) require efficient query optimization to minimize response times and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQuery', which leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize query plans in DDS. We develop a hierarchical DRL framework that learns to select optimal join orders, indexing strategies, and data placement schemes based on the query workload and system dynamics. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that DeepQuery outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource efficiency.
