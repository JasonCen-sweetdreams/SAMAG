In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation, leveraging distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) techniques. We propose a novel algorithm, 'DCA-Agent', that enables autonomous agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Our approach is based on a hierarchical DCOP framework, which reduces the communication overhead and improves the allocation quality. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm scenario demonstrate that DCA-Agent outperforms centralized and traditional decentralized methods in terms of allocation efficiency and robustness.
