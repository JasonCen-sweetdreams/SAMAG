The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors has led to an explosion of time-series data, posing significant challenges for efficient query processing. This paper introduces a novel indexing framework, 'STIndex', designed specifically for spatial-temporal queries in time-series databases. STIndex leverages a combination of hierarchical spatial indexing and temporal aggregation to accelerate query execution. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that STIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 5x in terms of query response time and 3x in terms of storage efficiency.
