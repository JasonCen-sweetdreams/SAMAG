Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable suggestions to users. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that integrates item, user, and contextual information to generate personalized recommendations. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to learn feature importance at multiple levels, enabling the model to focus on relevant aspects of the data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
