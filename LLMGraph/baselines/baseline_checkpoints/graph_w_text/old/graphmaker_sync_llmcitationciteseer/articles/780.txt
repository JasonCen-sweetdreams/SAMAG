Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data management, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization, 'DistroOpt', which leverages a combination of machine learning and graph algorithms to efficiently optimize queries across distributed nodes. We demonstrate that DistroOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and scalability, while maintaining high accuracy. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that DistroOpt can reduce query execution time by up to 50% compared to state-of-the-art methods.
