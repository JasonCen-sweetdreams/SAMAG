Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, where the goal is to reformulate the original query to better capture the user's information need. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a neural-based approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate query embeddings. These embeddings are then used to expand the original query by selecting relevant terms from a pseudo-relevance feedback set. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing the computational overhead.
