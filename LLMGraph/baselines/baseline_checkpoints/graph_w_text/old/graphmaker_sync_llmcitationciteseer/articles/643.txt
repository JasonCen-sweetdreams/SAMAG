Augmented reality (AR) is increasingly used in remote collaboration, but errors during task execution can lead to communication breakdowns and decreased productivity. This paper presents a novel gaze-based error detection system for AR-based remote collaboration. Our system leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze the gaze patterns of collaborators in real-time, detecting errors with high accuracy. We evaluate our system in a user study, demonstrating significant reductions in error rates and improved collaboration outcomes. The system has potential applications in various domains, including telemedicine, education, and industrial training.
