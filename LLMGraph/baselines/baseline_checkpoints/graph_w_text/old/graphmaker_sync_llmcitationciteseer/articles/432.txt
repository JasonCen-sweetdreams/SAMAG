Autonomous database systems (ADS) have gained popularity for their ability to self-manage and optimize performance. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in ADS. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans in ADS. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', leverages a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plan based on the database workload and system resources. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world database benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and system throughput compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
