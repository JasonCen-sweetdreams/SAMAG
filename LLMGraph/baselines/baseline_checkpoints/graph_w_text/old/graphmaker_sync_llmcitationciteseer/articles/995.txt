Conversational search systems aim to understand user intent behind natural language queries. However, the ambiguity and brevity of voice queries often lead to ineffective query expansion techniques. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'CAQE', which leverages context-aware embeddings to capture the nuances of user queries. By incorporating user preferences, session history, and domain knowledge, CAQE generates more informed query expansions that better match the user's information need. Experimental results on a large conversational search dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and user satisfaction compared to traditional query expansion methods.
