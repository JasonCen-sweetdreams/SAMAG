Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph learning, where a model must generalize to new nodes with limited labeled data. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical graph representations and attention mechanisms to adapt to new nodes. HGAT recursively applies graph attention to capture node features at multiple scales, and integrates a meta-learning strategy to fine-tune the model for few-shot learning. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT, achieving state-of-the-art performance on few-shot node classification tasks.
