Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an adaptive indexing approach that dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. Our approach, called 'Adapdex', leverages machine learning to predict query frequencies and identifies the most effective indexing structures. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database show that Adapdex achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance compared to traditional indexing methods, while reducing storage overhead by up to 40%.
