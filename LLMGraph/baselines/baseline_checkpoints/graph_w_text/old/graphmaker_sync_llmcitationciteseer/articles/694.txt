This paper explores the role of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in providing emotional support and building trust in healthcare interactions. We designed an ECA prototype, 'EmpaCare', that employs multimodal cues to convey empathy and understanding. A mixed-methods study with 120 participants revealed that EmpaCare significantly increased perceived trust and emotional support compared to text-based interfaces. Furthermore, we identified key design factors influencing user perceptions, including agent embodiment, gaze, and prosody. Our findings have implications for the development of ECAs in healthcare, enabling more inclusive and effective patient-provider interactions.
