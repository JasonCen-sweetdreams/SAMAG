This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework for autonomous agents, inspired by evolutionary game theory. We model the task allocation problem as a repeated game, where agents adapt their strategies over time to maximize their payoffs. Our approach leverages the concept of evolutionary stable strategies to ensure that agents converge to a stable and efficient task allocation. We evaluate our framework through simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenarios with varying task complexities and agent heterogeneity. The results show significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utility compared to existing decentralized allocation methods.
