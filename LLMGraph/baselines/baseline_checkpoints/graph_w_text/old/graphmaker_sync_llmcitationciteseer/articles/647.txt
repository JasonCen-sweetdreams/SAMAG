As graph databases continue to grow in size and complexity, query optimization becomes a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach for distributed graph databases, which leverages the inherent structure of the graph to reduce query latency and improve scalability. Our approach, called 'HierGdex', partitions the graph into a hierarchical set of subgraphs, each with its own optimized index. We evaluate HierGdex on several real-world graph datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing indexing methods, achieving up to 3x faster query response times.
