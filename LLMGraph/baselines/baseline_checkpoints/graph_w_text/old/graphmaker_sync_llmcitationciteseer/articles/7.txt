Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, aiming to refine user queries to better match relevant documents. This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based approach, 'ConEx', which leverages contextual embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and document content. ConEx uses a multi-layer transformer architecture to jointly learn query and document representations, and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval performance over traditional query expansion methods. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that ConEx achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in scenarios with short or ambiguous queries.
