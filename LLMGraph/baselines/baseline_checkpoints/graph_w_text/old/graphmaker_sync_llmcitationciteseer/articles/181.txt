Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called RLOpt, leverages a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plan based on the system's runtime environment. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RLOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
