Autonomous vehicles require sophisticated control policies to navigate complex scenarios. This paper presents a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for autonomous vehicle control. Our approach combines a high-level policy network with low-level control networks, enabling the vehicle to adapt to changing scenarios while maintaining stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in simulated and real-world experiments, achieving improved control performance and reduced computational overhead compared to flat RL methods.
