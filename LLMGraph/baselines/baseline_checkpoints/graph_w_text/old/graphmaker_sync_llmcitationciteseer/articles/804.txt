Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in data integration, where the goal is to resolve ambiguity in entity references across different data sources. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphDE', which leverages graph-based neural networks to perform entity disambiguation on distributed databases. GraphDE exploits the graph structure of the data to capture complex relationships between entities and utilizes a distributed processing framework to scale to large datasets. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphDE outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
