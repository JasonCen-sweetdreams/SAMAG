Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel neural approach to query reformulation, which leverages large-scale query logs to learn semantic patterns and relationships between keywords. Our model, dubbed 'QRN', incorporates a query encoder, a reformulation generator, and a relevance scorer. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset show that QRN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain, demonstrating the effectiveness of query log-based training for neural query reformulation.
