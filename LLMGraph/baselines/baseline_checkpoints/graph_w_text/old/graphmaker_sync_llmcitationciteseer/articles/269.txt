Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the semantic gap between the user's query and the relevant documents. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network-based QE approach, dubbed 'NeuroQE', which leverages the strengths of both language models and semantic embeddings. NeuroQE learns to generate context-dependent expansion terms by modeling the query-document interaction via a hierarchical attention mechanism. Our experiments on the TREC collections demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness compared to traditional QE methods, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
