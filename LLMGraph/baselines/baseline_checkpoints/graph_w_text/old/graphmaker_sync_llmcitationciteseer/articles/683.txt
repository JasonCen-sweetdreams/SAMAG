Autonomous agents are increasingly being deployed in complex, dynamic environments, necessitating the need for rigorous verification of their interactions. This paper presents a novel approach to formally specifying and verifying autonomous agent interactions using model checking. We propose a domain-specific language, AgentSpec, for specifying agent behaviors and interactions, and a model checking algorithm that leverages symbolic model checking to verify properties of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a case study involving autonomous vehicles, and show that it can identify subtle errors and inconsistencies in agent interactions that would be difficult to detect using traditional testing methods.
