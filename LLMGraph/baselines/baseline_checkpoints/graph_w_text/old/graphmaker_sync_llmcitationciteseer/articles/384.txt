Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design a deep reinforcement learning agent that learns to optimize queries based on runtime feedback. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
