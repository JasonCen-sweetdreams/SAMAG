Few-shot node classification in graph-structured data remains a challenging task, particularly when labeled nodes are scarce. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages both local and global node representations to improve classification performance. HGAN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and their neighbors, enabling effective information aggregation and propagation. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification scenarios, achieving an average improvement of 12.5% in accuracy.
