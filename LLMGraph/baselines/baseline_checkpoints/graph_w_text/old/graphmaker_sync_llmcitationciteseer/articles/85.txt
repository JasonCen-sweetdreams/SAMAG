The growing adoption of RDF data in various applications has led to an increasing need for efficient query processing on large-scale RDF graphs. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'RDFix', which leverages a combination of graph clustering and bitmap indexing to accelerate SPARQL query evaluation. RDFix is designed to minimize index construction time and storage requirements while providing fast query response times. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that RDFix outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in query execution time and 5x in storage efficiency.
