Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our method, dubbed 'NeuroQE', uses a siamese neural network to encode queries and documents into a shared vector space, allowing for efficient and effective query expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion techniques, especially in cases where query terms are rare or polysemous.
