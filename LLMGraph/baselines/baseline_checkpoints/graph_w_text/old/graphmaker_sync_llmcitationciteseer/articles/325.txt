In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving complex goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach, called 'GNN-TA', learns a joint representation of agents and tasks, enabling each agent to make informed decisions about task assignments. We evaluate GNN-TA in a simulated environment and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
