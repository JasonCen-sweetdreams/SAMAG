Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current VR interfaces often neglect the needs of users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces, emphasizing auditory and haptic feedback. We describe a user-centered design approach, involving participatory workshops with visually impaired individuals, to inform the development of accessible VR interactions. Our prototype, 'EchoVR', features a 3D audio spatialization system and tactile feedback mechanisms, enabling users to navigate and manipulate virtual objects. Evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces.
