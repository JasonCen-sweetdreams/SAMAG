Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complexity of patent documents and the need for precise query formulation. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'PatentGNNE', which leverages supervised graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn contextual relationships between patent terms and concepts. Our method outperforms traditional query expansion techniques by incorporating GNN-based term embeddings and a supervised learning framework. Experimental results on a large patent dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency, particularly for complex queries.
