Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, including entertainment, education, and healthcare. However, the lack of personalization in VR experiences can lead to user dissatisfaction and disengagement. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effects of personalization on user experience in VR. We designed and developed a VR platform that incorporates user modeling, adaptive difficulty adjustment, and real-time feedback. Our user study involving 100 participants demonstrates that personalized VR experiences lead to significant improvements in user engagement, satisfaction, and performance. We also identify key factors influencing personalization in VR, including user personality, learning style, and cognitive load.
