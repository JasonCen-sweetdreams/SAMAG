As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need for intuitive and efficient interaction methods. This paper explores the potential of gaze-based interaction for VR interfaces, focusing on user experience and performance. We designed and implemented a gaze-based interaction system using a state-of-the-art eye-tracking device and evaluated its usability and effectiveness in a series of user studies. Our results show that gaze-based interaction can significantly reduce interaction time and improve user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based methods, while also providing insights into user behavior and preferences.
