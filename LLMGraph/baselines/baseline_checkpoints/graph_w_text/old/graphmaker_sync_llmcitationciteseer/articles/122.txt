Distributed information retrieval systems (DIRS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data. However, query processing in DIRS can be slow due to the overhead of indexing and searching across multiple nodes. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing approach, 'ADIX', which dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distributions. Our experimental results on a large-scale DIRS testbed demonstrate that ADIX reduces query latency by up to 35% and improves retrieval accuracy by 12% compared to traditional static indexing methods.
