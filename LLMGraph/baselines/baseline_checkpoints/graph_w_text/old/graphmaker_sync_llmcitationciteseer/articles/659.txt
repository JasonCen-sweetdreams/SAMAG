Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, aimed at alleviating the vocabulary mismatch between the user's query and the document collection. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach to query expansion, which leverages the semantic relationships between words and phrases in a high-dimensional space. Our model, dubbed 'NeuroExpander', utilizes a combination of word embeddings and contextualized language models to identify relevant expansion terms, leading to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of NeuroExpander over traditional query expansion methods, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
