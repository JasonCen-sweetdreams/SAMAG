Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships in large-scale networks. However, the exponential growth in data size poses significant challenges to efficient query optimization. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphQLearn', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for massive graph databases. We design a custom reward function that balances query performance, memory usage, and CPU utilization. Our experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphQLearn outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3.5x in terms of query execution time and reduces memory consumption by 40%.
