In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive coalition formation strategies. This paper presents a decentralized algorithm for coalition formation, which leverages local information and communication to form coalitions that maximize the overall system utility. We introduce a novel mechanism for agent negotiation and coalition merging, which reduces the computational complexity of the coalition formation process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various task allocation scenarios, including disaster response and smart grid management.
