Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in smart home devices, but their usability for older adults remains a significant concern. This paper investigates the design of inclusive voice assistants that cater to the unique needs of older adults. We conducted a multimodal interaction study with 30 participants aged 65+, exploring the impact of speech recognition errors, visual feedback, and tactile cues on user experience. Our findings suggest that a hybrid interaction approach, combining voice and gesture-based input, can improve task completion rates and user satisfaction. We present a set of design guidelines for creating more accessible and user-friendly voice assistants, highlighting the importance of multimodal feedback and adaptive error handling.
