Distributed databases are increasingly used in modern applications, but optimizing queries across multiple nodes remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query optimization based on past execution experiences. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
