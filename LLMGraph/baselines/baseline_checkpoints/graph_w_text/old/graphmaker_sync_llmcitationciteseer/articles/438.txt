This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging auction-based mechanisms to optimize task assignments. Our approach, dubbed 'MAAT', enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences, resulting in more efficient and adaptive task allocation compared to traditional centralized methods. We formalize the problem as a combinatorial auction and propose a distributed algorithm that ensures truthful bidding and near-optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of MAAT in improving system performance and scalability.
