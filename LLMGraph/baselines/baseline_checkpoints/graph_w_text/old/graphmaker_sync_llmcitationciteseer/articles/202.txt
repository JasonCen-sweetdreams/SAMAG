As database systems evolve to accommodate increasing data volumes and velocities, traditional indexing techniques struggle to maintain query performance. This paper presents a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'FlexIndex', which combines the benefits of B+-trees and learned indexes. By incorporating machine learning models to predict query patterns and adapt to changing workloads, FlexIndex achieves superior query performance and storage efficiency compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that FlexIndex reduces query latency by up to 30% and storage requirements by up to 25%.
