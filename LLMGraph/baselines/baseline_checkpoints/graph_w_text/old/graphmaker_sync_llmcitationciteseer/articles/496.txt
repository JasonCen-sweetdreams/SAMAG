Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but users with visual impairments face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences, focusing on haptic and auditory cues to compensate for visual limitations. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, evaluating the effectiveness of our approach in a virtual shopping scenario. Results show significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional audio-only interfaces. We provide design guidelines and recommendations for VR developers to create more accessible and engaging experiences for users with visual impairments.
