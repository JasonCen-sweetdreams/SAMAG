Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been increasingly applied to various real-world domains, but it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing attack detection methods are limited to specific types of attacks or require extensive domain knowledge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based anomaly detection framework, 'GraphAD', to identify adversarial attacks in DRL. GraphAD leverages graph neural networks to model the relationships between state-action pairs and detects anomalies using a variant of the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm. Our experiments on several Atari games and MuJoCo environments demonstrate that GraphAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting diverse types of attacks while maintaining a low false positive rate.
