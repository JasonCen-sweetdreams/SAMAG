As data volumes continue to grow, distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in DDS due to the complexity of distributed data and the need to minimize communication costs. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, called GraphIndex, which leverages graph theory to efficiently optimize queries in DDS. GraphIndex partitions the data graph into smaller subgraphs, enabling the creation of a hierarchical index that reduces query latency and improves overall system performance. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphIndex outperforms existing query optimization techniques in DDS, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x.
