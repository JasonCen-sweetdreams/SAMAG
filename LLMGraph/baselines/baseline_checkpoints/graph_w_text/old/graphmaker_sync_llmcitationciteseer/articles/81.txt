Knowledge graphs have become a crucial component in various AI applications, but they often suffer from entity ambiguity, which hinders their accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach, HGAN-ED, that leverages hierarchical graph attention networks to disambiguate entities in large-scale knowledge graphs. HGAN-ED exploits the hierarchical structure of the graph to capture both local and global context, enabling it to distinguish between entities with similar names. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN-ED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, while being more computationally efficient.
