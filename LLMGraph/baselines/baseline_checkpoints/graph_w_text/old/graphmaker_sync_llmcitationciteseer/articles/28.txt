Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive conversational interfaces that accommodate the needs of this population. Our approach incorporates a set of cognitive support strategies, including simplification, chunking, and visual cues, to facilitate comprehension and engagement. We evaluate our framework through a user study with 20 older adults, demonstrating improved conversation success rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional conversational interfaces.
