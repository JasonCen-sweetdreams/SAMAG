Real-time analytics on large datasets has become a crucial requirement in various domains. Main-memory databases (MMDBs) have emerged as a promising solution, but they pose significant concurrency control challenges. This paper presents a novel concurrency control protocol, called 'RT-Opt', which leverages a combination of multi-version concurrency control and adaptive locking to minimize latency and ensure high throughput in real-time analytics workloads. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world financial dataset demonstrates that RT-Opt outperforms existing concurrency control schemes in MMDBs, achieving up to 3x improvement in query throughput and 2x reduction in latency.
