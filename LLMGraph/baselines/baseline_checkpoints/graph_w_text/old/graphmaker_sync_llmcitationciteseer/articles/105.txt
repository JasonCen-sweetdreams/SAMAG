Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'DocEx', which incorporates document expansion to capture semantic relationships between query terms and document content. DocEx leverages a multi-layer transformer architecture to model query-document interactions and generates expanded document representations that better match the query intent. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries with low term frequency.
