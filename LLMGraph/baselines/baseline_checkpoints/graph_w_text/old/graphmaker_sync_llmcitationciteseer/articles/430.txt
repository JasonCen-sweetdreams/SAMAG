The increasing adoption of graph databases in various domains has led to a surge in query optimization research. However, existing approaches often rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, resulting in suboptimal query plans. This paper presents a novel machine learning-based approach, 'GraphOpt', which learns to predict optimal query plans from a dataset of historical queries and execution statistics. We employ a graph neural network to encode query structures and a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the planning process. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
