Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging task due to the complexity of distributed query planning and the need to adapt to changing system conditions. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization in DDS using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL-based query optimizer that learns to select optimal execution plans based on system performance metrics, such as latency and throughput. Our experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
