This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for efficient multi-agent cooperation in dynamic environments. Our approach enables agents to selectively focus on relevant teammates and environmental factors, reducing computational complexity and improving coordination. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a series of simulation experiments, showcasing significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
