As Virtual Reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the cognitive and motor demands of gestural interaction is crucial. This study investigates the effects of cognitive load on user performance and experience in VR environments. We designed a within-subjects experiment where participants performed a series of gestural tasks under varying cognitive load conditions. Our results show that cognitive load significantly impairs gestural accuracy and speed, while also increasing subjective reports of mental effort and frustration. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of more intuitive and user-centered VR interfaces.
