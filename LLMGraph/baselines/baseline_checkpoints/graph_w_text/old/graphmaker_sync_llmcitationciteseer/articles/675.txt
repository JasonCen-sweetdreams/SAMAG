Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel neural embedding-based approach, 'EmbExpan', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate semantic query expansions. We propose a two-stage framework that first identifies salient query terms using a neural attention mechanism and then generates context-aware expansions via a variational autoencoder. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmbExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
