In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach, dubbed 'GNN-Allocator', exploits the structural properties of the agent graph to learn a distributed task assignment policy. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that GNN-Allocator outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized methods, achieving faster task completion and improved overall system performance.
