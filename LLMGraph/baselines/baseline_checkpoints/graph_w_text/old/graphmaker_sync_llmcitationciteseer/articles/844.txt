Multi-agent systems often require efficient task allocation to achieve complex objectives. This paper proposes a novel decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Our framework, 'DAGANT', leverages the structural properties of the agent communication graph to learn task assignment policies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DAGANT in various scenarios, including disaster response and smart city management, and show that it outperforms traditional centralized optimization methods in terms of scalability and adaptability.
