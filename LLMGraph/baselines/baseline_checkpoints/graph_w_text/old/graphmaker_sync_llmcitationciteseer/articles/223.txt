Subgraph matching is a fundamental operation in graph databases, with applications in social network analysis, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs. However, its computational complexity grows exponentially with the size of the graph. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, GraphSieve, which leverages a hierarchical filtering approach to prune the search space. GraphSieve incorporates a compact graph representation and an efficient similarity measure, enabling fast and scalable subgraph matching. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate a significant speedup over existing methods, with an average improvement of 3.5x in query response time.
