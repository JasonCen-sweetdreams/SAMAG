Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience and engagement in VR environments. We designed and conducted a user study to compare the effects of haptic feedback, visual feedback, and no feedback on user engagement and task performance. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user engagement, reduces cognitive load, and enhances overall VR experience. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose future research directions for incorporating haptic feedback in VR applications.
