Search result diversification is crucial for providing users with a comprehensive understanding of their query topics. Existing query expansion techniques often rely on static or manual methods, leading to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE', which leverages both semantic and syntactic relationships between query terms. HQE incorporates a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify latent topics and expand the query with relevant terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of search result diversity, novelty, and relevance.
