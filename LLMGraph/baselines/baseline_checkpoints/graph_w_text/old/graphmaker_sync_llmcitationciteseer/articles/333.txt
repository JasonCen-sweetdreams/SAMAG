Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in node classification tasks. However, existing methods often overlook the hierarchical structure present in many real-world graphs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, 'HierAtt', which captures both local and global dependencies in graphs. By incorporating attention mechanisms at multiple scales, HierAtt adaptively selects relevant neighbors and subgraph patterns, leading to improved classification performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HierAtt in node classification, outperforming state-of-the-art GNN models.
