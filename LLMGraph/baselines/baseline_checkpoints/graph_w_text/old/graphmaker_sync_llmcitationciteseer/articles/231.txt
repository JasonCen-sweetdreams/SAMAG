Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial for various applications, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, most existing approaches lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for explainable time series anomaly detection. HAN uses a hierarchical structure to capture both local and global patterns in the data, and an attention mechanism to highlight the contributing factors of detected anomalies. We evaluate HAN on several real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
