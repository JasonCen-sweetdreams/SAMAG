Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a complex problem due to the vast space of possible execution plans. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, which can be inefficient or incomplete. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. We design a Markov decision process that models the query optimization problem and train an agent to learn an optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
