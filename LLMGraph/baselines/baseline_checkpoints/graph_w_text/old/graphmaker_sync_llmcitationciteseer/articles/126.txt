Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus and extracting the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural dense retrieval (HNDR) approach that leverages the strengths of both sparse and dense retrieval methods. Our HNDR model consists of a coarse-grained passage retriever and a fine-grained sentence retriever, which are jointly trained to optimize the retrieval process. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset show that HNDR outperforms state-of-the-art ODQA models in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
