In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel auction-based mechanism for task allocation, which leverages a combination of heuristics and constraint programming to optimize task assignments. Our approach, dubbed 'HeurAuc', adaptively adjusts bid prices based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and system-level constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that HeurAuc outperforms existing auction-based methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and overall system efficiency. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the optimality and convergence of our approach.
