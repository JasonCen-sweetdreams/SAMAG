Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) demands high-performance transactional support to ensure freshness and consistency of data. Existing concurrency control methods, however, struggle to balance responsiveness and serializability in the presence of frequent updates. We present a novel multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) approach, called RT-MVCC, tailored for RTDW. By maintaining multiple versions of data and intelligently resolving conflicts, RT-MVCC reduces latency, increases throughput, and guarantees serializability. Experimental results on a realistic RTDW workload demonstrate that RT-MVCC outperforms state-of-the-art concurrency control methods, achieving up to 3.5x improvement in transactional throughput.
