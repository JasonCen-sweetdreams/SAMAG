Recommendation systems have become increasingly important in modern e-commerce and online services. However, traditional collaborative filtering methods suffer from scalability issues and cold start problems. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships. We demonstrate the efficacy of HGAT on several real-world datasets, achieving significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and scalability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
