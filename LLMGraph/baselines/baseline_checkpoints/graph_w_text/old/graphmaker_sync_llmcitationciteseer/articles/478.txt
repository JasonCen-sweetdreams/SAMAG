Explainable recommendation systems are crucial for building trust with users. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework that integrates item relationships, user behavior, and contextual information to provide personalized recommendations. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to focus on relevant items and aspects, allowing for interpretable explanations of the recommendation process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate improved recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
