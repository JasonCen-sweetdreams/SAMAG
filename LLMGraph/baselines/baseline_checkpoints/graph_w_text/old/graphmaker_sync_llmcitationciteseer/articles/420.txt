In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to learn optimal assignment policies. Our approach, called 'RL-Allocator', enables agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing environmental conditions, such as task arrivals and failures. We evaluate RL-Allocator in a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
