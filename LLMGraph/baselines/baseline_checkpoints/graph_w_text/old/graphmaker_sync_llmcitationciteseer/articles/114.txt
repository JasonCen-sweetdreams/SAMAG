In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in such systems. By recursively applying attention mechanisms at both local and global levels, HAN captures nuanced relationships between agents and improves decision accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN on a real-world traffic simulation dataset, showcasing its ability to provide interpretable explanations for agent decisions.
