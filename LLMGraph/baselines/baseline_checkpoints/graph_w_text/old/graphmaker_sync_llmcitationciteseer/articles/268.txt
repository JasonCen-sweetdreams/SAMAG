Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide transparent and trustworthy suggestions. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture that leverages both item-level and user-level graph structures to generate personalized recommendations. We introduce a multi-level attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant items and user preferences, enabling the model to capture complex relationships and provide interpretable explanations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in improving recommendation accuracy while providing meaningful explanations.
