Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between data distribution, network topology, and query semantics. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate query optimization as a Markov decision process and design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the DDS. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
