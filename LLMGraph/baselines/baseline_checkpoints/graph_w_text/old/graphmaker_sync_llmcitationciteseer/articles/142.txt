Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the heterogeneity of modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on salient features across modalities and fuse them effectively. Our HAN model consists of three levels of attention: intra-modal, inter-modal, and fusion attention. Experimental results on the CMU-MultiModal dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal inputs, achieving an average F1-score improvement of 5.2%
