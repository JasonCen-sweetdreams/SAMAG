Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAT) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. HAT incorporates multi-scale attention mechanisms to capture both local and global patterns in the data. We introduce an attention-based attribution method to quantify the contribution of each feature and timestamp to the anomaly score. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for the detected anomalies.
