In multi-agent systems, agents often possess incomplete knowledge about their environment and other agents. This paper presents a novel hybrid reasoning framework that combines logical rules with probabilistic inference to reason about incomplete knowledge in multi-agent systems. We introduce a new algorithm that leverages the strengths of both deductive and inductive reasoning to make more informed decisions in uncertain environments. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving decision-making accuracy and efficiency.
