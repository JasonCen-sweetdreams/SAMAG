Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on term co-occurrence statistics or manual thesaurus construction. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'KGExpander', which leverages knowledge graph embeddings to capture semantic relationships between entities and terms. By integrating KGExpander with a state-of-the-art retrieval model, we demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness on several benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that KGExpander outperforms traditional query expansion methods, especially for queries with ambiguous or rare terms.
