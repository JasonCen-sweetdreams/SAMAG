Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal query plan by interacting with the database environment. Our approach takes into account various factors, including data distribution, network latency, and available resources. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional query optimizers, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x while reducing the optimization time by 30%.
