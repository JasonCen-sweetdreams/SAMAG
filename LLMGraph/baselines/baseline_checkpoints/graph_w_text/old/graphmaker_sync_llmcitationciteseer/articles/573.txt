Distributed database systems are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing queries in such systems is a complex task. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We propose a deep Q-network-based framework that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on the query execution time. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques in terms of execution time and resource utilization. We also demonstrate the scalability of our approach by evaluating it on a real-world distributed database system.
