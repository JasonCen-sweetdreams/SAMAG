Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in constructing knowledge graphs, but existing approaches struggle with scalability and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering-based method, 'HClusED', for entity disambiguation in large-scale knowledge graphs. HClusED leverages the structural properties of knowledge graphs and employs a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group similar entities. We evaluate HClusED on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance while scaling to large knowledge graphs with millions of entities.
