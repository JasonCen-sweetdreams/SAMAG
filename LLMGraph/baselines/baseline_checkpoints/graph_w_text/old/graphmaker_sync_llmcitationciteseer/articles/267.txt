Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability and transparency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages both temporal and spatial attention mechanisms to identify anomalies in multivariate time series data. We introduce an explainability module that generates saliency maps to highlight the most informative features contributing to the anomaly detection. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while providing insightful explanations for its predictions.
