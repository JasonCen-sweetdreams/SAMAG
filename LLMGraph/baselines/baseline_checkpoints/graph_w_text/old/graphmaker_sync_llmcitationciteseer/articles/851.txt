Neural search engines have shown promising results in various information retrieval tasks. However, their performance is often limited by the quality of the query representation. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using meta-learning, which adapts to the specific characteristics of the search engine and query distribution. Our method, called MetaQE, learns to generate expanded queries that improve the retrieval performance of the search engine. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that MetaQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, especially for rare and ambiguous queries.
