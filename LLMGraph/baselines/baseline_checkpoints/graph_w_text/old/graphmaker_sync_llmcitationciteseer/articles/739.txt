Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents an accessible VR interface design framework, 'VirtuaTouch', which utilizes haptic feedback, 3D audio cues, and voice commands to enable visually impaired users to navigate and interact with virtual environments. We conducted usability studies with 20 visually impaired participants and found that VirtuaTouch significantly improves their overall VR experience and task performance. Our findings provide guidelines for designing inclusive VR interfaces that cater to diverse user needs.
