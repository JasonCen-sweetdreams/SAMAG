Ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval results. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages a pre-trained language model to iteratively refine query representations. We reformulate the query expansion problem as a sequential prediction task, enabling NeuroQE to adaptively generate context-aware expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust-04 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
