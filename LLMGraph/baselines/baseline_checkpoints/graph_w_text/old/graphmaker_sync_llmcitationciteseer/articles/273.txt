This paper proposes a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for autonomous agents, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn efficient allocation strategies. We model the agent interactions as a graph, where each node represents an agent and edges denote communication links. Our GNN-based algorithm, called 'DAGNA', learns to predict task allocations based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and network topology. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that DAGNA outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in terms of allocation efficiency, adaptability, and robustness to agent failures.
