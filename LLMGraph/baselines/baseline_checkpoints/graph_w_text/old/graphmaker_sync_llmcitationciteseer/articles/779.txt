In this paper, we propose a novel approach to distributed task allocation for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and develop a deep Q-network-based algorithm to learn the optimal task allocation policy. Our approach enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization. We also show that our approach can be applied to various real-world scenarios, such as disaster response and autonomous drone swarms.
