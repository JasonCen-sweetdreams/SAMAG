Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query execution. Our approach is able to adapt to changing database workloads and optimize query performance in real-time. Experimental results on a distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
