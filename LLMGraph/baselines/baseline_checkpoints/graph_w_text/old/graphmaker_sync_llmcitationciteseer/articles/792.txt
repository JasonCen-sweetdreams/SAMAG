Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
