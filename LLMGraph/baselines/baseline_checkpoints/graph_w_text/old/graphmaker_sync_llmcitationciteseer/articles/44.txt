Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex network data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity of graph structures. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, GraphZip, which leverages graph clustering and partitioning to accelerate query execution. We propose a cost-based optimization framework that dynamically selects the most efficient index configuration based on query patterns and graph topology. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphZip outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage efficiency.
