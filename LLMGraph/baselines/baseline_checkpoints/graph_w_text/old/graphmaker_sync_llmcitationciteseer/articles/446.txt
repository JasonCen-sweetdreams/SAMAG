Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a challenging task due to the complexity of distributed systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and develop an RL agent that learns to select optimal query plans based on the database's workload and system dynamics. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
