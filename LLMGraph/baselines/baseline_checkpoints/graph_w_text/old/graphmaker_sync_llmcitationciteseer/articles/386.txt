Few-shot image classification remains a challenging task in machine learning, particularly when faced with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework, which leverages both local and global graph structures to learn robust feature representations. By incorporating attention mechanisms at multiple scales, HGAT effectively captures complex relationships between image regions and improves classification performance. Experimental results on popular few-shot benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of HGAT, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several datasets.
