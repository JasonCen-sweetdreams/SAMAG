Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, as it can significantly impact the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for query expansion, which learns to select the most informative terms from the top-retrieved documents. Our method, dubbed 'QERL', uses a policy gradient algorithm to optimize the expected reciprocal rank of the expanded query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QERL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, including RM3 and KL-divergence, in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
