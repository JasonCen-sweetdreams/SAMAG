In multi-agent systems, efficient resource allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous resource allocation using reinforcement learning. Our method, called MARA, learns to allocate resources based on the agents' task requirements, environmental constraints, and shared objectives. We demonstrate MARA's effectiveness in a simulated robotic search-and-rescue scenario, where it outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization. Our results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning in enabling autonomous decision-making in complex multi-agent systems.
