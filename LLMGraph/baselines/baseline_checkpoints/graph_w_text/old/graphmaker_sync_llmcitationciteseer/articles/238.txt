In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel graph-based reinforcement learning approach to autonomous task allocation, where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities and the graph structure of the system. We introduce a hierarchical graph representation that captures both agent-agent and agent-task relationships, and a reinforcement learning framework that leverages this representation to optimize task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead compared to traditional allocation methods.
