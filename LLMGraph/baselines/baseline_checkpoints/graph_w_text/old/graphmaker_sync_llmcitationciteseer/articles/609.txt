Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a complex task, requiring careful tuning of various parameters. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design a RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query performance. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 3.2x in query execution time.
