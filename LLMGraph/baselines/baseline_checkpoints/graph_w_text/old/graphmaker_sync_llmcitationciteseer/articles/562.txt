Traditional query expansion techniques rely on handcrafted rules or statistical methods, which often fail to capture the nuances of natural language semantics. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages word embeddings and knowledge graphs to expand queries in a more informed and context-aware manner. Our method, called SemEx, represents query terms as dense vectors and uses graph-based reasoning to identify related concepts and entities. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that SemEx significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval precision and recall.
