Traditional ranking models for information retrieval (IR) are often limited by their inability to capture complex semantic relationships between documents. We propose a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HierRank, which leverages the strengths of both lexical and semantic matching techniques. HierRank employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to model the interaction between query and document terms, and then integrates this information using a neural ranking module. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and ClueWeb09 datasets demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, achieving significant improvements in both precision and nDCG.
