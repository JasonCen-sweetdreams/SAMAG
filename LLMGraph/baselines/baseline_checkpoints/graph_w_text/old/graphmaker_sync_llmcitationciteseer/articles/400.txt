Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We propose a deep Q-network-based framework that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database configuration, query workload, and system resources. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization. We also demonstrate the applicability of our framework in a real-world distributed database system.
