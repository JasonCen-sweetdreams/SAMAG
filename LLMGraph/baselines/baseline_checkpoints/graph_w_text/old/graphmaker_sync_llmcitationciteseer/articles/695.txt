This paper proposes a novel query representation approach for ad-hoc retrieval, which incorporates knowledge graph embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between entities and concepts. Our method, called KGQR, learns to map queries and documents into a shared vector space, where the query representation is enriched with knowledge graph embeddings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that KGQR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query representation models, especially for queries with ambiguous or entity-centric keywords. We also show that KGQR can be effectively combined with BERT-based ranking models to further improve retrieval performance.
