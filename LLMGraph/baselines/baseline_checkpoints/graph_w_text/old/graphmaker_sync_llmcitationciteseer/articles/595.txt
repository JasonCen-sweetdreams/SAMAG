Multi-tenancy has become a popular architectural choice for cloud-based relational databases, enabling multiple customers to share the same database instance. However, query optimization in such environments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MT-Opt', designed specifically for multi-tenant relational databases. MT-Opt leverages a combination of static and dynamic analysis to identify optimal query plans that minimize resource contention and maximize overall system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world cloud database deployment demonstrate that MT-Opt achieves up to 40% improvement in query response times and 25% reduction in CPU utilization compared to existing optimization techniques.
