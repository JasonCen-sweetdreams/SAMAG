Coordinating multiple agents in complex, dynamic environments is a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that facilitates effective cooperation among agents. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to model intra-agent relationships and inter-agent interactions, enabling agents to selectively focus on relevant information and adapt to changing environmental conditions. We evaluate our method on a variety of multi-agent scenarios, demonstrating improved cooperation and task performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
