The rapid growth of big data has led to a significant increase in the size and complexity of data warehouses, making query optimization a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel distributed query optimization approach that leverages machine learning techniques to predict optimal query plans. Our framework, 'DQO-ML', uses a combination of feature engineering and deep reinforcement learning to adapt to changing data distributions and workload patterns. Experimental results on a real-world data warehousing workload demonstrate that DQO-ML outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and reduces resource utilization by 2x.
