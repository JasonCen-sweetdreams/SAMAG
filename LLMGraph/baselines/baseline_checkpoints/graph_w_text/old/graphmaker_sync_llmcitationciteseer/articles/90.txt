Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyVoice', a novel voice assistant that incorporates cognitive support features to facilitate interaction. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 older adults with mild cognitive impairment, revealing that EasyVoice significantly improved task completion rates and reduced user frustration compared to a commercial voice assistant. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and supportive voice interfaces for this vulnerable population.
