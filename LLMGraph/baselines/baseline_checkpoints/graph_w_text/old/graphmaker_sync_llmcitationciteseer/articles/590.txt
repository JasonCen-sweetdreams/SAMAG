This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture for explainable multi-agent reinforcement learning. HGAT leverages attention mechanisms to model complex agent interactions and hierarchical graph structures to capture both local and global dependencies. We propose a novel explainability module that generates interpretable visualizations of agent decision-making processes. Experimental results on a range of multi-agent environments demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both performance and explainability, providing insights into the decision-making processes of individual agents and their interactions.
