Search result diversification is crucial for improving user satisfaction in modern search engines. This paper presents a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages user behavior, query context, and semantic relationships to generate diverse search results. CAQE incorporates a graph-based ranking model that balances relevance, novelty, and diversity in the top-k results. Experimental evaluations on a large-scale web dataset demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art diversification methods in terms of both user satisfaction and search engine metrics.
