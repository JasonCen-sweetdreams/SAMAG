Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing query performance for real-time analytics on these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphPulse', which leverages graph summarization and caching to reduce query latency. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that selects the most effective summarization and caching strategies for a given query workload. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that GraphPulse achieves up to 5x speedup over existing query optimization techniques.
