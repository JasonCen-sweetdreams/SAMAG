In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents, making it challenging to understand and interpret the decision process. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent systems. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant interactions between agents, allowing for interpretable decision-making at both local and global levels. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in improving decision-making accuracy and transparency compared to traditional reinforcement learning approaches.
