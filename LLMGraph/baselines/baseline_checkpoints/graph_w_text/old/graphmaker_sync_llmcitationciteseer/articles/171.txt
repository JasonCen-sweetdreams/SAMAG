In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using reinforcement learning, called 'AgentQL'. AgentQL trains each agent to learn a policy that maximizes the overall system reward, while adapting to dynamic task arrivals and agent capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentQL in a simulated robotic search-and-rescue scenario, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
