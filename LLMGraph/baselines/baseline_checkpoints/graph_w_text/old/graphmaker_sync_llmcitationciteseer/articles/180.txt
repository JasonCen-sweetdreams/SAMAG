Resource allocation in distributed systems is a complex problem that can be formulated as a multi-agent negotiation task. This paper presents a novel framework for agent-based negotiation, which incorporates a combination of game-theoretic and machine learning techniques. We propose a probabilistic negotiation strategy that takes into account the agents' preferences, resource constraints, and uncertainty in the negotiation process. Experimental results on a simulated distributed system demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient resource allocation while ensuring fairness and stability.
