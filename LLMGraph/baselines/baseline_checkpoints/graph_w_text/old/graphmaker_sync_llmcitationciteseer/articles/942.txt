The proliferation of IoT devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARA', which enables adaptive resource allocation in IoT networks. In MARA, each agent represents an IoT device and learns to optimize its resource usage based on local observations and reward signals. We introduce a decentralized Q-learning algorithm that leverages graph neural networks to capture complex dependencies between agents. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT network simulator demonstrate that MARA outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of resource utilization and network performance.
