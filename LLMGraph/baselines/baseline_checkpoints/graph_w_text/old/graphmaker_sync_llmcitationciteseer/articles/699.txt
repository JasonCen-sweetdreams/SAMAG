Autonomous agents operating in complex environments often face the challenge of allocating tasks efficiently. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We propose a novel algorithm, 'AgentDCOP', which leverages asynchronous communication and iterative constraint propagation to solve the task allocation problem in a decentralized manner. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that AgentDCOP outperforms centralized optimization methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
