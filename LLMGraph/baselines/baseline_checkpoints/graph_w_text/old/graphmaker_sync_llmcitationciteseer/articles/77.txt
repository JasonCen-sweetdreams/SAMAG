Distributed database systems pose significant query optimization challenges due to their complex architecture and dynamic workloads. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design a deep RL framework that learns to optimize query plans based on performance metrics such as execution time and resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
