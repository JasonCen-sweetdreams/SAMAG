Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable results. This paper introduces HieraRec, a novel hierarchical attention framework that disentangles user and item representations into multiple semantic aspects. By recursively applying attention mechanisms, HieraRec captures complex dependencies between aspects and generates personalized explanations for each recommended item. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HieraRec in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality. We further demonstrate the applicability of HieraRec in various ERS scenarios, including movie and product recommendations.
