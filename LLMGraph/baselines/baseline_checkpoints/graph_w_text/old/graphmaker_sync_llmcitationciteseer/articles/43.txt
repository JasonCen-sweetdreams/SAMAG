Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a neural semantic embedding-based approach to query expansion, dubbed 'NeuroExpand'. By jointly learning query and document representations in a shared semantic space, NeuroExpand enables the incorporation of contextualized term relationships and semantic similarities into the query expansion process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for queries with ambiguous or nuanced semantics.
