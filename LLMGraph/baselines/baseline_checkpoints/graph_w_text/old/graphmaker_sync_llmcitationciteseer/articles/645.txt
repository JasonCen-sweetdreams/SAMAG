Optimizing query execution plans is crucial for Distributed Database Systems (DDS) to achieve high performance. Traditional optimization techniques rely on rule-based or cost-based approaches, which may not adapt well to changing workloads and system dynamics. This paper proposes a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, 'QOpt', that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment. QOpt uses a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to select the best join order and indexing strategy, and is trained using a reward function that balances query execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup show that QOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
