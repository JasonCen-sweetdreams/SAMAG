Virtual reality (VR) technology has made significant strides, but user experience remains hampered by limited haptic feedback. This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive haptic feedback in VR, leveraging machine learning and psychophysical models to tailor tactile stimulation to individual users. Our approach incorporates user preference, task complexity, and sensory adaptation to generate personalized haptic feedback profiles. Experimental results demonstrate improved user satisfaction, reduced fatigue, and enhanced task performance in a variety of VR applications.
