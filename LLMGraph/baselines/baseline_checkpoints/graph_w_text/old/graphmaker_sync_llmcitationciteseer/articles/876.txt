Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have gained popularity in recent years, but optimizing queries for multiple tenants while ensuring isolation and performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'OptiScale', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and graph-based modeling to efficiently optimize queries for multi-tenant DBaaS platforms. We introduce a tenant-aware cost model that captures the impact of concurrent queries on resource utilization and propose a scalable optimization algorithm that adapts to changing workload patterns. Experimental results on a large-scale DBaaS platform demonstrate that OptiScale reduces query latency by up to 40% and improves resource utilization by up to 25% compared to existing optimization techniques.
