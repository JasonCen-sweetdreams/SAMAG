This paper presents a novel approach to document retrieval using hierarchical neural tensor networks (HNTNs). We propose a multi-stage architecture that leverages the strengths of both neural networks and traditional information retrieval techniques. The HNTN model learns to represent documents as dense vectors, enabling efficient similarity computations and improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of mean average precision and retrieval time.
