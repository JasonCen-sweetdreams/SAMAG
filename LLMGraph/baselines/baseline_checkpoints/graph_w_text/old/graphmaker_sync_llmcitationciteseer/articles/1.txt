Emotion recognition from multimodal data (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and fuse them effectively. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific encoders, a hierarchical attention mechanism, and a multimodal fusion layer. Experiments on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in emotion recognition accuracy and robustness to missing modalities.
