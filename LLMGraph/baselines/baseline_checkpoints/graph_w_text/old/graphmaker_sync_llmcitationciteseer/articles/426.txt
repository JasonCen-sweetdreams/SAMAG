Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on effective passage retrieval to answer user queries. However, the traditional approach of retrieving passages based on keyword matching often falls short in capturing the query context. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion framework, 'QDEP', which leverages semantic role labeling and dependency parsing to identify relevant contextual information in documents. Our experiments on the QASPER benchmark demonstrate that QDEP significantly improves passage retrieval accuracy and downstream QA performance compared to state-of-the-art keyword-based methods.
