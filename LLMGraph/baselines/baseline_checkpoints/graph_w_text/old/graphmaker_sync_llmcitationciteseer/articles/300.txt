Real-time data warehousing demands efficient query optimization to support rapid decision-making. This paper proposes an adaptive query optimization framework, 'AQO', that leverages machine learning to dynamically adjust query plans based on workload patterns and system performance. AQO integrates a novel workload forecasting model with a cost-based optimizer to minimize query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world data warehousing benchmark demonstrate that AQO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in query response time and 25% in resource utilization.
