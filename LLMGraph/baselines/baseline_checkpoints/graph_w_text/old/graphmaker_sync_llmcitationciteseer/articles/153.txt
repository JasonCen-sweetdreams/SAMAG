This paper presents a novel approach to gesture recognition for older adults with motor impairments. Our system, 'EasyGest', utilizes a machine learning-based framework that adaptively adjusts to individual users' abilities and gesture patterns. We conducted a user study with 20 older adults with varying levels of motor impairment, demonstrating significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional, non-adaptive approaches. Our findings have important implications for the design of inclusive and accessible human-computer interaction systems.
