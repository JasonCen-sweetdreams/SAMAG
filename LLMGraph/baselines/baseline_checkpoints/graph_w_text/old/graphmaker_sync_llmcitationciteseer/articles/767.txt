In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to coordinate task allocation among agents. We introduce a decentralized, hierarchical framework where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities, task urgency, and environmental constraints. Our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and overall system efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations and a real-world case study on disaster response scenarios.
