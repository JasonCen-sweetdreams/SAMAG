Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, but the lack of interpretability hinders trust and adoption. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to identify anomalies. Our approach, dubbed 'HierAnom', learns to focus on relevant segments and features, providing explainable insights into the anomaly detection process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HierAnom in detecting anomalies and outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We also provide a visual analytics toolkit for practitioners to explore and understand the model's decisions.
