Distributed column-stores have become increasingly popular for storing and processing large datasets. However, existing indexing techniques often ignore data skew, leading to poor query performance and inefficient resource utilization. This paper presents 'SkewIndex', a novel indexing approach that incorporates skew-aware partitioning and adaptive indexing. SkewIndex dynamically adjusts the index granularity based on data distribution and query patterns, resulting in significant improvements in query latency and resource efficiency. Experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of SkewIndex in reducing query times by up to 70% compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
