Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval to improve the retrieval performance. However, existing methods often rely on shallow term associations, neglecting semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'DeepTerm', which leverages deep semantic term embeddings to capture subtle term relationships. We introduce a neural network-based model that learns to project terms into a dense vector space, enabling effective query expansion through semantic similarity computation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepTerm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in mean average precision.
