Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval to improve the retrieval performance. However, existing query expansion methods often struggle with sparse document collections, where the term frequency is low. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, which leverages the semantic relationships between terms and documents to identify relevant expansion terms. Our approach first constructs a hierarchical graph of terms and documents, and then applies a graph-based ranking model to select the most informative expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
