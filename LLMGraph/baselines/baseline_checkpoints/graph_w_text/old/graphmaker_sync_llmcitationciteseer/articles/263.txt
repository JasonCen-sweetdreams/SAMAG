Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework that incorporates audio-haptic feedback and semantic zooming to enhance usability for visually impaired users. We evaluated our design through a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our findings provide valuable insights for designing inclusive VR experiences that can be enjoyed by a broader range of users.
