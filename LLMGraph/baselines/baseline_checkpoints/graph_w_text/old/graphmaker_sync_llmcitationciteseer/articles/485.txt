Optimizing query execution plans is a crucial task in distributed database systems, as it significantly impacts query performance. Existing approaches rely on hand-crafted heuristics or costly trial-and-error methods. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'RL-Optimizer', which learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system. We design a reward function that balances query latency and resource utilization, and demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database system. Experimental results show that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource efficiency.
