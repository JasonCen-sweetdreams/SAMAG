Entity disambiguation in knowledge graphs is a crucial task, as it affects the accuracy of various downstream applications. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphAttDisamb', which leverages graph attention networks to model the complex relationships between entities and their context. Our method adaptively weights the importance of neighboring entities and types, enabling the model to focus on the most informative features for disambiguation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphAttDisamb outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 12.5% in F1-score.
