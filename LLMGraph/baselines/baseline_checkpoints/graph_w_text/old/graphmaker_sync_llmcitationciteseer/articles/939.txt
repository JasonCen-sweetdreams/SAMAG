Effective disaster response requires the coordination of multiple agents, including rescue teams, drones, and autonomous vehicles. This paper presents a novel, scalable framework for dynamic task allocation in multi-agent systems. Our approach leverages a hierarchical auction mechanism, where agents bid on tasks based on their capabilities and availability. We introduce a novel, graph-based task clustering algorithm that reduces the computational complexity of the auction process. Experimental results using real-world disaster response scenarios demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements in response time and resource allocation efficiency compared to existing approaches.
