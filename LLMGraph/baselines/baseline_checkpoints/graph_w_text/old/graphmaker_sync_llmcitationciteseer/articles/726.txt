The proliferation of graph-structured data has led to a growing need for real-time analytics on distributed graph databases. However, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck due to the complexity of graph querying and the distributed nature of the data. This paper presents 'GraphOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages graph summarization and parallel query execution to reduce query latency. We introduce a cost-based optimization model that considers both data distribution and query patterns, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real-world social network dataset. Experimental results show that GraphOpt achieves an average query speedup of 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
