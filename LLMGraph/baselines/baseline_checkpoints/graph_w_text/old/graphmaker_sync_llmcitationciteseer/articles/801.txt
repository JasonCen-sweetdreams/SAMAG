Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing inclusive VR interfaces tailored to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with stakeholders, including caregivers and individuals with mild cognitive impairment, to identify key design requirements. Our proposed interface incorporates simplified navigation, cognitive support tools, and personalized feedback mechanisms. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces.
