Coordinating multi-agent systems to achieve complex tasks often relies on centralized control or simplistic communication protocols. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework that enables explainable cooperation among agents. By modeling agent interactions as hierarchical graphs, HGAT learns to focus on relevant relationships and negotiate tasks through attention-based communication. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in a variety of cooperative scenarios, including traffic management and search-and-rescue missions, and provide insights into the learned attention patterns.
