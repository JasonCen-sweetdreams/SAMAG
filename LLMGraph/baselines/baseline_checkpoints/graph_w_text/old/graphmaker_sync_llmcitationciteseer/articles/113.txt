Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts performance and scalability. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which can lead to suboptimal query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and use deep Q-networks to learn an optimal query plan selection policy. Our experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our RL-based approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
