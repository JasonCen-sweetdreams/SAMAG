Specialized search engines are crucial for information retrieval in domains like law, medicine, and finance. However, their query processing efficiency is often hindered by the complexity of domain-specific queries. This paper proposes a novel Latent Query Analysis (LQA) framework that leverages deep learning-based query embeddings to identify semantic patterns in user queries. Our approach enables the construction of efficient query indexes, reducing the average query response time by up to 40% compared to traditional inverted index methods. Experimental results on a large-scale legal search engine dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of LQA in improving retrieval performance.
