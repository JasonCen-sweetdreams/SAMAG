This study explores the impact of embodied cognition on learning outcomes in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed an immersive VR-based learning platform that incorporates gestures, haptic feedback, and spatial awareness to facilitate deeper engagement with complex concepts. Our user study involving 120 participants shows that embodied cognition significantly improves retention rates, spatial reasoning, and transfer of learning to real-world scenarios. We also identify key design factors, such as gesture recognition accuracy and haptic feedback latency, that influence the effectiveness of embodied cognition in VR learning environments.
