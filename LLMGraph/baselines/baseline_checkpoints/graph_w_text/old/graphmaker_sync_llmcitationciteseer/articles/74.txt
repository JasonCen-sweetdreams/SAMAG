In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize agent assignments. We introduce a novel multi-agent deep Q-network (MADQN) that learns to adapt to dynamic task environments and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods, achieving faster task completion times and improved overall system utility.
