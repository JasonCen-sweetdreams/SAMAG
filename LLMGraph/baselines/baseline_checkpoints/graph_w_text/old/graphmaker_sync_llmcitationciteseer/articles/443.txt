Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) is essential for timely business decision-making, but maintaining materialized views incrementally poses significant scalability challenges. This paper presents a novel solution, 'IVM-RT', which leverages a combination of incremental view maintenance techniques and distributed processing to achieve high performance and scalability. Our approach exploits the inherent parallelism of data warehousing workloads and utilizes a hybrid in-memory and disk-based storage architecture to minimize view maintenance overhead. Experimental results on a large-scale RTDW benchmark demonstrate that IVM-RT outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by up to 3x in terms of maintenance time while ensuring data freshness and consistency.
