Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and varying workloads. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to adapt to changing database conditions and optimize query plans accordingly. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
