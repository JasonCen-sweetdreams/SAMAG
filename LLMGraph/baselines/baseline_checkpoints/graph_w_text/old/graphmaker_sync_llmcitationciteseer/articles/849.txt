This paper presents a novel approach to designing gesture-based interfaces for older adults, leveraging machine learning to improve usability and accessibility. We propose a hybrid method that combines rule-based and machine learning-based approaches to recognize gestures, and evaluate its effectiveness through a user study with 30 participants aged 65+. Our results show that the proposed interface achieves a 35% reduction in gesture recognition errors and a 25% increase in user satisfaction compared to existing approaches. We also provide guidelines for designers to create more intuitive and accessible gesture-based interfaces for older adults.
