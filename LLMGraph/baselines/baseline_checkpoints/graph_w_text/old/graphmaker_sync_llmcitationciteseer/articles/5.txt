Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges in interacting with computers, leading to barriers in education, employment, and social inclusion. We propose EyeGazeType, a novel eye-tracking based typing system that leverages machine learning and computer vision to enable efficient and accurate text entry. Our approach combines a gaze-based interface with a probabilistic language model to infer intended characters, achieving an average accuracy of 92.5% in our user study with participants with motor impairments. We also explore the impact of individual differences in eye movement patterns on system performance, providing insights for personalized calibration and adaptation.
