Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and node heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called QOptRL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system dynamics. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that QOptRL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
