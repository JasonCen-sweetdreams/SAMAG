In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We propose a novel algorithm, 'DCA-MA', which leverages local constraint propagation and iterative improvement to find near-optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark problems demonstrate that DCA-MA outperforms existing decentralized methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. Our approach is particularly suited for large-scale, dynamic environments where centralized coordination is infeasible.
