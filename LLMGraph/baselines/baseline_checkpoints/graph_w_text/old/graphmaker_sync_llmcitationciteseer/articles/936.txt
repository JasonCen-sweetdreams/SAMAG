We present a novel approach to multi-agent task allocation, which is a fundamental problem in distributed AI systems. Our method, called Graph-Task-Allocator (GTA), leverages deep graph reinforcement learning to efficiently allocate tasks to agents in real-time. GTA learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a graph and uses a deep Q-network to optimize task assignments based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication costs. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that GTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, response time, and communication overhead.
