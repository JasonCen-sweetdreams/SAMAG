Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems to improve the retrieval performance. Existing methods often rely on lexical matching or shallow semantic analysis, which may not fully capture the nuanced relationships between query terms and documents. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach, GraphExpan, which leverages graph convolutional networks to learn semantic representations of query terms and documents. Our approach enables the capture of complex relationships between entities, concepts, and keywords, leading to more effective query expansion and improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of GraphExpan over state-of-the-art methods.
