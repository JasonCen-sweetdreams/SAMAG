Distributed document retrieval systems face significant challenges in terms of scalability and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages the structural properties of distributed indexes to improve retrieval performance. HQE incorporates a two-stage expansion process, where the initial query is first expanded using a local index, followed by a secondary expansion using a global index. We evaluate HQE on a large-scale document collection and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
