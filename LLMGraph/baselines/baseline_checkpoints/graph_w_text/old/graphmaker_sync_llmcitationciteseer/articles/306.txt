Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in many applications, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, existing methods often struggle with scalability and robustness issues. This paper proposes a novel graph-based contrastive learning approach, 'GraphCon', which leverages the structural properties of time series data to identify anomalies. By constructing a graph from the time series data and applying contrastive learning, GraphCon can capture complex patterns and relationships, resulting in improved detection performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of GraphCon, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
