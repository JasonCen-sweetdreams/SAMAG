Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed database systems, where suboptimal query plans can lead to significant performance degradation. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We propose a deep Q-network-based framework, 'DQN-Opt', which learns to select optimal query plans by interacting with the database system. We demonstrate that DQN-Opt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that DQN-Opt can effectively adapt to changing database workloads and query patterns.
