Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous queries. While query expansion has shown promise, its effectiveness is limited by the quality of the expanded terms. This paper proposes a context-aware embedding approach, 'CAQE', which captures the semantic relationships between query terms and their relevance to the information need. By leveraging a graph-based neural network, CAQE generates embeddings that incorporate both syntactic and semantic features. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, especially for queries with high ambiguity.
