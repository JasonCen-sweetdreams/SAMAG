Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge, particularly in distributed settings. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'DGraphOpt', which leverages graph partitioning and parallel processing to accelerate query execution. We introduce a cost-based optimization strategy that considers both data locality and query complexity, resulting in improved performance and reduced communication overhead. Experimental evaluation on a real-world social network dataset demonstrates that DGraphOpt outperforms existing state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 3x.
