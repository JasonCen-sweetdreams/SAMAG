In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism for task allocation, which leverages the strengths of both combinatorial auctions and distributed optimization. Our approach, termed 'D-Auction', enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences, while ensuring that the overall system objectives are met. We prove the convergence and optimality of D-Auction in various settings and demonstrate its effectiveness in a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario.
