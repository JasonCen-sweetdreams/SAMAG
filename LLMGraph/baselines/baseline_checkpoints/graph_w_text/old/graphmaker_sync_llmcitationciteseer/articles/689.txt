Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and scale horizontally. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning techniques to optimize query plans in distributed databases. We present a framework that uses a combination of feature engineering and reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query plan given a query workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
