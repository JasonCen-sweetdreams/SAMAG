Virtual assistants have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but interacting with them using voice commands can be error-prone. This paper explores gaze-based interaction as a novel modality for interacting with virtual assistants. We design and implement a gaze-based interface and conduct a user study to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing errors and improving user experience. Our results show that gaze-based interaction can reduce errors by up to 30% compared to voice-based interaction, while also improving user satisfaction and engagement. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future virtual assistants and their potential applications in various domains.
