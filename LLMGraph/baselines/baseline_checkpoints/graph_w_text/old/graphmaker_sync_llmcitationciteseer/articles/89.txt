Cloud computing has become a ubiquitous paradigm for on-demand resource provisioning. However, efficient resource allocation remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between varying workload demands and limited infrastructure capacity. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, 'CloudOptimizer', which leverages a hierarchical actor-critic architecture to learn optimal resource allocation policies. Our experimental results on a real-world cloud dataset demonstrate that CloudOptimizer achieves significant improvements in resource utilization and request satisfaction rates compared to traditional heuristic-based approaches.
