This study investigates the effect of avatar personalization on user experience in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR system that either allowed or disallowed avatar customization. Our results show that personalized avatars increased user engagement, self-presence, and overall satisfaction. Furthermore, we found that the perceived sense of agency and embodiment were significantly higher in the personalized avatar condition. These findings have implications for the design of VR systems, suggesting that incorporating avatar personalization can enhance user experience and promote more effective human-computer interaction.
