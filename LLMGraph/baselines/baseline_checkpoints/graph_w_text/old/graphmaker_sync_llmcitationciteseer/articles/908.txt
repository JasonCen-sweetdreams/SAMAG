Ad-hoc retrieval often suffers from the vocabulary mismatch problem, where the query terms fail to match the relevant documents. Query expansion (QE) techniques have been proposed to address this issue, but they often rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse domains. This paper proposes a novel QE approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn a dense representation of queries and documents. Our model, called DeepQE, uses a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize QE and relevance ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
