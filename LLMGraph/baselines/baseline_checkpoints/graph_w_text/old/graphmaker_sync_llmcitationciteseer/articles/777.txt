Multi-tenancy has become a ubiquitous paradigm in modern database systems, where a single database instance serves multiple isolated tenants. However, query optimization in such systems remains a significant challenge due to the diverse workload patterns and varying resource requirements of each tenant. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MTQOpt', that leverages machine learning-based predictive modeling and adaptive resource allocation to optimize query performance across multiple tenants. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database system demonstrate that MTQOpt achieves up to 30% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
