As the global elderly population grows, there is a pressing need for assistive technologies that can support their independence and well-being. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'ElderCare', an intelligent virtual assistant tailored to the needs of older adults. We employed a participatory design approach, involving elderly users and caregivers in the development process. Our system integrates natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning to provide personalized assistance with daily activities, health monitoring, and social interaction. A usability study with 30 elderly participants demonstrated significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to existing virtual assistants.
