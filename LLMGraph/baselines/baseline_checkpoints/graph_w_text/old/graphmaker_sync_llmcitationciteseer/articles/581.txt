In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient decision-making to achieve global objectives. This paper presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for distributed task allocation among autonomous agents. Our approach uses a two-level hierarchy, where high-level agents learn to allocate tasks to low-level agents, and low-level agents learn to execute tasks. We evaluate our framework in a simulated warehouse management scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
