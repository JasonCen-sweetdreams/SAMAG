Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants that cater to this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving surveys, interviews, and usability testing to identify key design requirements. Our findings emphasize the need for simplification, explicit feedback, and error tolerance. We propose a set of design guidelines and demonstrate their efficacy through a prototype voice assistant, 'EasyVocal', which improves task completion rates and user satisfaction among older adults with cognitive impairments.
