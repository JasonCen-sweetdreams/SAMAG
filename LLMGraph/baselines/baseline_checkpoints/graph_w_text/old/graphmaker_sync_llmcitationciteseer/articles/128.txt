Distributed database systems pose significant query optimization challenges due to the complexity of data distribution and varying system loads. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our DRL-based optimizer, 'DQOpt', learns to select optimal execution plans by interacting with the database environment and receiving rewards based on query performance. We demonstrate that DQOpt outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization, especially in highly dynamic and heterogeneous distributed database settings.
