Time series anomaly detection is crucial in various applications, including finance and healthcare. However, existing methods often neglect uncertainty estimates, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel deep Bayesian neural network (BNN) framework, 'DBTSAD', which leverages stochastic variational inference to learn probabilistic representations of time series data. DBTSAD incorporates uncertainty-aware loss functions and a hierarchical prior structure to capture complex temporal dependencies. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that DBTSAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to outliers, while providing reliable uncertainty estimates.
