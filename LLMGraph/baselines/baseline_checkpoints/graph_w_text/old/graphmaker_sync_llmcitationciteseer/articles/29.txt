Time-series anomaly detection is a critical task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to detect anomalies in time-series data. We introduce a novel explainability module that generates visualizations of the attention weights, enabling users to understand the contribution of each feature and timestamp to the anomaly score. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods in terms of both detection accuracy and explainability.
