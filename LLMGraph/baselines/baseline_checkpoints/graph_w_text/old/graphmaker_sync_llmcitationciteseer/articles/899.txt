Ad-hoc retrieval techniques often rely on query expansion to improve the retrieval accuracy. However, existing methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality and lack of semantic understanding of the query. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages the power of language models to generate more informative and diverse query expansions. Our model consists of a query encoder, a term generator, and a ranking module. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
