Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence, particularly in scenarios with complex interactions and partial observability. This paper presents a novel approach using hierarchical graph attention networks (HGAT) to learn effective coordination strategies. Our method represents agents as nodes in a hierarchical graph, where attention mechanisms are applied to capture both local and global dependencies. We evaluate HGAT on a variety of multi-agent tasks, including traffic management and robot soccer, and demonstrate significant improvements in coordination efficiency and overall system performance.
