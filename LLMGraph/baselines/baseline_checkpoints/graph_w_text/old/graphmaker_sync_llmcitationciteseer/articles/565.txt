Traditional information retrieval models rely on handcrafted features and simple ranking functions, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural network (HNN) architecture for document ranking, which learns to represent documents and queries in a hierarchical manner. Our approach leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural layers to capture both local and global context. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HNN-based ranking model outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average precision.
