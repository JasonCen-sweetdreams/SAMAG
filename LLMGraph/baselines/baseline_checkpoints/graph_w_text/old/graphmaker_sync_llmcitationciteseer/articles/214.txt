Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but its adoption is hindered by the inaccessibility of VR interfaces for users with visual impairments. This paper presents an empirical study on the design of accessible VR interfaces for visually impaired users. We propose a novel framework that incorporates audio-based navigation, haptic feedback, and voice commands to facilitate interaction. Our user study involving 20 visually impaired participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for designing inclusive VR experiences.
