Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges when interacting with modern computing systems. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an adaptive gesture-based interface that accommodates varying levels of motor ability. Our system, 'GESTALT', uses machine learning to recognize and adapt to the user's gestural patterns, providing real-time feedback and adjusting the interface's sensitivity and complexity accordingly. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates that GESTALT enables users with motor impairments to perform tasks more efficiently and accurately compared to traditional interfaces.
