Traditional recommendation systems often rely on shallow models that fail to capture complex user-item relationships. We propose HGAT, a novel hierarchical graph attention network that leverages the power of graph neural networks to model user behavior. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant items and users, enabling efficient processing of large-scale graphs. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency.
