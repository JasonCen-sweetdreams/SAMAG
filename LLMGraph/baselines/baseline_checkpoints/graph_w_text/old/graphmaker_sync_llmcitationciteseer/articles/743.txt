Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it can significantly improve the retrieval performance. However, the existing methods often rely on heuristic strategies or rely on manual feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query expansion using reinforcement learning, where the agent learns to select the most informative terms to expand the query. Our approach, called QERL, leverages a deep Q-network to learn the policy of query expansion. The experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that QERL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval performance and efficiency.
