Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, query optimization in such systems remains a complex and challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and develop a deep Q-network-based algorithm to learn optimal query plans. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
