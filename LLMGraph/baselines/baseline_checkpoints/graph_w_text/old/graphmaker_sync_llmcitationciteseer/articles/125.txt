Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems typically rely on a two-stage approach: first, retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus, and then, extracting the answer from these passages. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) method that significantly improves the efficiency of passage retrieval in ODQA. By learning a hierarchical representation of passages, HDR reduces the number of required comparisons, leading to a 3x speedup in retrieval time while maintaining competitive answer accuracy. We evaluate HDR on several ODQA benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in retrieving relevant passages and improving overall system efficiency.
