Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, as models often struggle to generalize to novel classes with limited training data. This paper proposes a hierarchical meta-learning framework, 'HiMeta', which leverages task-aware clustering and attention-based knowledge sharing to improve few-shot classification performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HiMeta on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet. Our approach enables efficient adaptation to new classes, even with limited computational resources.
