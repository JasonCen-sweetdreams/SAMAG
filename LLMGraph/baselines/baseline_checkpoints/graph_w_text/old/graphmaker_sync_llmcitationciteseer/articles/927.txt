Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for many applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explanations for its predictions. Our HAN model consists of multiple layers of attention mechanisms that focus on relevant segments and features of the time-series data. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting anomalies while outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of explainability.
