Neural search models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but often struggle with vocabulary mismatch and limited training data. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to improve the retrieval performance of neural search models. Our approach uses a reinforcement learning framework to learn the optimal expansion strategy, which is adapted to the specific query and document collection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in recall and precision.
