Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their scalability and fault-tolerance. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage RL to learn an optimal query plan. Our approach, 'RL-Opt', is able to adapt to changing workload patterns and optimize queries more efficiently than traditional optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Opt achieves an average query performance improvement of 25% compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods.
