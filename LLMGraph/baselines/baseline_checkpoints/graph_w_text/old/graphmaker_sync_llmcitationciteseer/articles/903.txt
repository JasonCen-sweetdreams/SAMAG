Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, from entertainment to education. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the impact of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 100 participants, using a 3D avatar customization system that incorporates machine learning-based facial recognition and emotional intelligence. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, sense of presence, and enjoyment, while also reducing anxiety and motion sickness. We discuss the implications of our findings for VR-based applications and outline future research directions.
