In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving system-level goals. This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation using reinforcement learning. We model the task allocation problem as a decentralized Markov decision process and propose a deep Q-network-based algorithm that enables agents to learn optimal task assignments. Experimental results in a simulated environment demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and system utility. We also analyze the robustness of our approach to varying agent capabilities and communication topologies.
