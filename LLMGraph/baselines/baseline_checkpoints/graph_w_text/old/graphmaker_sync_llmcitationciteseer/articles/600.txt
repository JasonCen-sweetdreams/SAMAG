Column-oriented NoSQL databases have gained popularity in big data analytics due to their ability to handle massive amounts of data. However, query optimization in these databases remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization technique, 'ColOpt', that leverages column-level statistics and machine learning-based cost estimation to optimize query plans. Our approach reduces query execution time by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques, while also providing better support for complex queries and ad-hoc analytics. We evaluate ColOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in various scenarios.
