Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current VR systems often exclude users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that accommodate users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a user-centered design study with 20 participants with disabilities, identifying key barriers and opportunities for inclusivity. Our framework incorporates multimodal input, adaptable interfaces, and personalized accessibility features, enabling users to customize their VR experience according to their needs. We evaluate our approach through a case study of a VR game, demonstrating improved usability and enjoyment for users with disabilities.
