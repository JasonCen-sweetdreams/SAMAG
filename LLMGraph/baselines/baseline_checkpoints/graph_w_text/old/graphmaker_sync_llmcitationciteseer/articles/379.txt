Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Despite significant advances in neural ranking models, their computational complexity and memory requirements remain a major bottleneck for large-scale retrieval. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural network architecture, 'HierRank', which leverages both local and global contextual information to efficiently rank documents. We demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art models on several benchmark datasets while reducing computational costs by up to 30%. Our approach has significant implications for large-scale retrieval systems, enabling faster and more accurate document ranking.
