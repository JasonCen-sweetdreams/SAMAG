Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR interfaces often exclude this population due to their complex design. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing accessible VR interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key usability challenges and design requirements. Our findings inform the development of a novel VR interface, 'CARE', which incorporates cognitive support features, simplified navigation, and personalized assistance. A user study with 20 older adults demonstrates that CARE significantly improves user engagement, task completion, and overall VR experience.
