Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed a user study with 120 participants, who interacted with a VR platform using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibit higher levels of engagement, measured through metrics such as time spent in the VR environment and self-reported enjoyment. We also found that the perceived sense of embodiment and body ownership were significantly higher for users with personalized avatars. The implications of these findings are discussed, and future research directions are outlined.
