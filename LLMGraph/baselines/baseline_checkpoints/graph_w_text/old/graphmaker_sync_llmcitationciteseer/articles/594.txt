Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a crucial technique for link prediction in multi-relational graphs. However, existing methods struggle to effectively capture complex relationships and contextual information. This paper proposes a novel KGE framework, 'GraphAtt-KGE', which leverages graph attention networks to learn nuanced entity representations. By adaptively weighting neighboring entities and relations, GraphAtt-KGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, including WN18RR and FB15k-237. Our approach demonstrates improved robustness to noisy data and scalability to large graphs, paving the way for more accurate link prediction in real-world applications.
