This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, specifically designed for ad-hoc retrieval tasks. Our proposed model, 'QNLP', uses a combination of recurrent and convolutional neural networks to learn a robust representation of query terms and their relationships. We demonstrate that QNLP can effectively capture semantic and contextual information, leading to improved retrieval performance on benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, with significant gains in precision and recall.
