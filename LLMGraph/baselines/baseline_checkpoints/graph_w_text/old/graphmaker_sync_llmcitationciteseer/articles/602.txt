Virtual reality (VR) interfaces often rely on precise hand gestures, excluding users with motor impairments. This paper presents an adaptive gesture recognition system, 'IncluVR', which learns to recognize gestures from a diverse range of user abilities. IncluVR employs a hybrid approach, combining machine learning with computer vision techniques to detect and classify gestures. Our user study with 30 participants demonstrates improved recognition accuracy and reduced latency for users with varying levels of motor ability, enabling more inclusive VR experiences.
