Coordinating multi-agent systems in dynamic environments is a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous role-based coordination using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a hierarchical framework, 'ARCO', which learns to assign roles to agents based on their capabilities and environmental context. ARCO utilizes a deep Q-network to optimize role assignments, and a decentralized actor-critic method to learn agent policies. Experimental results in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that ARCO outperforms traditional coordination methods in terms of task completion time and adaptability to changing environments.
