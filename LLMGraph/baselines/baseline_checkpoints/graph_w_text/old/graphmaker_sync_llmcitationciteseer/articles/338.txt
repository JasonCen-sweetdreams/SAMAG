As multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need for transparent and interpretable decision-making mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision making. Our approach leverages attention weights to identify influential agents and features, providing insights into the decision-making process. We evaluate the performance of HAN on a range of benchmarks, demonstrating improved decision quality and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we introduce a novel metric for evaluating the explainability of multi-agent decision making, which we use to analyze the effectiveness of HAN.
