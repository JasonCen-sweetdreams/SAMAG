Temporal graphs, which model dynamic relationships between entities over time, have numerous applications in social network analysis, traffic pattern mining, and recommender systems. However, real-time analytics on these graphs is challenging due to their massive scale and high velocity. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'TempoGI', which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, caching, and incremental updates to enable fast query processing on temporal graphs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TempoGI through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, achieving up to 10x performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
