With the proliferation of cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms, optimizing query performance becomes increasingly crucial. This paper presents 'QTune', a novel query optimization framework designed specifically for multi-tenant DBaaS environments. QTune leverages machine learning-based prediction models to identify optimal query execution plans, taking into account dynamic workload characteristics and resource constraints. Our experimental evaluation on a commercial DBaaS platform shows that QTune achieves significant improvements in query response times and resource utilization, while ensuring fairness and isolation among co-located tenants.
