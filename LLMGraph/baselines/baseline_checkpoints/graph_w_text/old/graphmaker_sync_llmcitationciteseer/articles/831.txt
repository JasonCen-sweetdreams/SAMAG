In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Our approach employs graph neural networks to learn the relationships between agents and tasks, and generates effective allocation strategies in a distributed manner. We formulate the task allocation problem as a graph optimization problem and solve it using a decentralized graph neural network architecture. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, outperforming traditional centralized methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
