In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem due to the need to balance individual agent goals with global system objectives. This paper proposes a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning, where each agent learns to allocate tasks by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards based on system-level performance metrics. We introduce a decentralized, asynchronous Q-learning algorithm that enables agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental dynamics. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system efficiency compared to traditional, centralized allocation methods.
