Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular due to their scalability and fault-tolerance. However, optimizing data retrieval efficiency remains a significant challenge. This paper presents AQRouter, a novel adaptive query routing algorithm that dynamically adjusts the routing strategy based on real-time system workload and data distribution. Our approach leverages machine learning-based predictive modeling to forecast query execution times and optimize data retrieval paths. Experimental results on a large-scale DDS testbed demonstrate that AQRouter achieves an average of 35% reduction in query latency and 28% improvement in system throughput compared to state-of-the-art routing algorithms.
