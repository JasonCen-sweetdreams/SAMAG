This paper presents a novel framework for designing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) that facilitate inclusive healthcare interactions for diverse patient populations. We investigate the effects of ECA embodiment, language, and cultural awareness on patient engagement and trust. Our user study with 120 participants reveals that ECAs with culturally sensitive avatars and dialogue systems can improve patient satisfaction and reduce anxiety in healthcare consultations. We provide guidelines for ECA design that prioritize empathy, clarity, and personalized support, and discuss implications for healthcare systems and accessibility.
