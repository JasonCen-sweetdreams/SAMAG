Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish tasks efficiently. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn decentralized task allocation policies. We design a GNN-based architecture that takes into account the graph structure of the agent communication network and the task requirements. Our approach enables agents to make decisions based on local observations and communication with neighbors, without requiring a centralized controller. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach compared to traditional decentralized methods.
