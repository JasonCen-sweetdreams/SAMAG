Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EASE', a novel voice assistant interface tailored to the needs of this vulnerable population. We conducted a participatory design process with caregivers and older adults to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings led to the development of EASE, which incorporates features such as simplified vocabulary, visual cues, and error tolerance. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
