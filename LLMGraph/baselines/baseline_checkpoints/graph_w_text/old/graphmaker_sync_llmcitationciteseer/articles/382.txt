Cloud computing has become increasingly popular, but efficient resource allocation remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a decentralized autonomous agent-based framework for optimizing resource allocation in cloud computing environments. Our approach leverages multi-agent systems to autonomously negotiate and allocate resources, taking into account dynamic workload demands and availability. We evaluate our framework using a realistic cloud simulation and demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization and allocation efficiency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
