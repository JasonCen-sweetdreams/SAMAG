Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources to meet dynamic workload demands. This paper explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize resource allocation in cloud environments. We propose a novel DRL framework, 'CloudOptimizer', which leverages a combination of deep Q-networks and graph neural networks to learn efficient allocation policies. Experimental results on a large-scale cloud simulation platform demonstrate that CloudOptimizer achieves significant improvements in resource utilization and request satisfaction rates compared to traditional heuristics and rule-based approaches.
