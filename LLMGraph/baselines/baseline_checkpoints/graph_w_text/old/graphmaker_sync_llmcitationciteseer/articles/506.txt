Voice assistants have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing systems often struggle to accommodate their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants, focusing on the role of cognitive support and error recovery. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, yielding insights into the importance of intuitive navigation, personalized feedback, and emotional support. Our prototype, 'CareVoice', incorporates these findings and demonstrates improved usability and user satisfaction in a pilot study.
