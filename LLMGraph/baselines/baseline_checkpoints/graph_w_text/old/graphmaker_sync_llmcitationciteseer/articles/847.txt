As the volume of digital data continues to grow, traditional indexing methods in information retrieval systems are becoming increasingly inefficient. This paper proposes a novel neural hashing approach, dubbed 'DeepIndex', which learns compact binary representations of documents to facilitate fast and accurate retrieval. We demonstrate that DeepIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query latency and recall, while reducing memory requirements by up to 75%. Our approach is scalable to large document collections and can be seamlessly integrated into existing IR systems.
