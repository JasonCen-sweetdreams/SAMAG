Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize social interactions, but users often report feeling disconnected from their virtual counterparts. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on social presence in VR. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a collaborative task. Results show that personalized avatars significantly increase social presence, as measured by self-reported surveys and physiological responses. Furthermore, we identify specific design factors, such as facial likeness and gesture accuracy, that contribute to this effect. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to facilitate social connections.
