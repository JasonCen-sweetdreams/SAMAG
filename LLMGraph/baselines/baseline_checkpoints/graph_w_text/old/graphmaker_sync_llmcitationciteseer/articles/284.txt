Main-memory column-store databases (MMCS) have gained popularity for their high performance and low latency. However, the memory layout of MMCS can significantly impact query performance. This paper proposes a novel data layout optimization algorithm, 'ColOpt', which leverages statistical analysis and machine learning to predict the optimal memory layout for a given workload. We evaluate ColOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and memory utilization compared to existing MMCS layouts.
