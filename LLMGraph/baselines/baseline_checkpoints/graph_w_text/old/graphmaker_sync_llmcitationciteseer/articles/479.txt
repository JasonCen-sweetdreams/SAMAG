In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive strategies. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to allocate tasks to agents in a decentralized manner. We introduce a multi-agent Q-learning algorithm that enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing environments. The proposed approach is evaluated using a simulated robotic swarm scenario, demonstrating improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional heuristic-based methods. Our results have implications for real-world applications, such as search and rescue operations and autonomous surveillance systems.
