Node classification in dynamic graphs is a challenging task due to the evolving graph structure and node features. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms at multiple scales to capture complex dependencies between nodes. Our approach consists of a hierarchical clustering module that groups nodes into clusters, followed by a graph attention layer that learns to weigh the importance of neighboring nodes. Experimental results on several real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks, especially in scenarios with frequent graph updates.
