Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder, often struggle to interact with these systems. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant that accommodates the needs of individuals with dysarthria. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with individuals with dysarthria, caregivers, and speech therapists to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed system incorporates adaptive speech recognition, personalized feedback mechanisms, and multimodal input options to facilitate more effective and empowering interactions. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
