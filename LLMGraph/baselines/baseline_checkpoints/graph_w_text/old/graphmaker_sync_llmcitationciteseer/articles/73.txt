Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve cognitive function and overall well-being in older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often pose usability challenges for this demographic. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CARE', a novel VR framework tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. CARE incorporates multimodal feedback, simplified interfaces, and personalized navigation assistance to facilitate accessible and engaging VR experiences. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR systems.
