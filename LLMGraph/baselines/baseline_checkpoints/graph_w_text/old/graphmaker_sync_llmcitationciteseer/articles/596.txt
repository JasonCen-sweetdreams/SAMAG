Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial for many applications, but most existing methods lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights. Our HAN model comprises two levels of attention: 1) a temporal attention mechanism that captures long-term dependencies and 2) a feature attention module that highlights relevant features contributing to anomalies. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for the detected anomalies.
