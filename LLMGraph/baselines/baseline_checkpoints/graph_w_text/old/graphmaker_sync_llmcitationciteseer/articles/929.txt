As the global population ages, designing accessible interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments becomes increasingly important. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interface, 'EasyGesture', which adapts to the cognitive and motor abilities of individual users. We employ a machine learning-based approach to recognize and classify gestures, and introduce a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism to ensure users remain engaged and motivated. A user study with 30 older adults with cognitive impairments demonstrates that EasyGesture significantly improves user performance and satisfaction compared to traditional button-based interfaces.
