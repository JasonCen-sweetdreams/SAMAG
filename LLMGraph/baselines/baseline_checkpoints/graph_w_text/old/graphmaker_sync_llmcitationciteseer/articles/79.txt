In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages stochastic optimization to allocate tasks to agents in a distributed manner. Our approach, dubbed 'DecTASO', models the task allocation problem as a stochastic optimization problem, which is solved using a distributed variant of the simulated annealing algorithm. We evaluate DecTASO on a set of benchmark problems and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving near-optimal task allocations in various scenarios, including those with heterogeneous agent capabilities and dynamic task requirements.
