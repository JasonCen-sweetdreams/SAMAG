Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in natural language processing and information retrieval. Existing approaches often suffer from scalability issues and inadequate modeling of relationships between entities. We propose a novel graph-based collective inference framework, 'GECI', which leverages structural dependencies between entities to improve disambiguation accuracy. GECI represents entities as nodes in a graph and utilizes a iterative neighborhood aggregation strategy to refine entity representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GECI outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average precision gain of 12.5% while scaling to large datasets.
