Query expansion is a crucial step in improving the retrieval performance of search engines. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using neural word embeddings, which captures the semantic relationships between words in a more effective manner than traditional methods. Our approach, called SemExp, leverages pre-trained language models to generate a set of expansion terms that are semantically closest to the original query. We evaluate SemExp on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we show that SemExp can be easily integrated into existing search engines with minimal modifications.
