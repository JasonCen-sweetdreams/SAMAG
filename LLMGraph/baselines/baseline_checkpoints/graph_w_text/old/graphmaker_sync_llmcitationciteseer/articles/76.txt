Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems to improve the retrieval effectiveness. While traditional approaches rely on hand-crafted rules and statistical models, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages the power of neural networks to learn query expansion strategies. We design a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query representation, expansion, and ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency.
