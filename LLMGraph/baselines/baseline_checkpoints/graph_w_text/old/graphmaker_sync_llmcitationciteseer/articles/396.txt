Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages machine learning techniques to predict the optimal query execution plan. GraphOpt uses a graph neural network to learn a representation of the query and data distribution, and then applies a reinforcement learning algorithm to explore the space of possible execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
