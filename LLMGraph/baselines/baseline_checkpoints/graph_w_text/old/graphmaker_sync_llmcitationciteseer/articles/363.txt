This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation in autonomous warehouses using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our method, called MA-RTA, enables a team of robots to learn to allocate tasks efficiently in a distributed manner, without requiring explicit communication or centralized control. We formalize the task allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and develop a multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to solve it. Experimental results using a simulated warehouse environment demonstrate that MA-RTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, robot utilization, and adaptability to changing warehouse conditions.
