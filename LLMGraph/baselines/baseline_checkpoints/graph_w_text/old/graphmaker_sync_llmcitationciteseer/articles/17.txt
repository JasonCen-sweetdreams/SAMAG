Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interactional limitations can exacerbate accessibility barriers for users with disabilities. This study investigates the role of affective feedback in enhancing the user experience of voice assistants for individuals with visual, hearing, or motor impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study, combining co-design workshops with a user study of a custom-built voice assistant prototype. Our results show that participants with disabilities prefer affective feedback in the form of emotional expressions and personalized tone, which improved their perceived trust, confidence, and overall satisfaction with the system. We provide design implications for creating more inclusive voice assistants that cater to the diverse needs of users with disabilities.
