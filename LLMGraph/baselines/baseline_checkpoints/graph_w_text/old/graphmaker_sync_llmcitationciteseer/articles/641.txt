Distributed database systems (DDS) integrating heterogeneous data sources face significant query optimization challenges. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'HetOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and adaptive query rewriting. HetOpt learns to identify the most efficient query execution plans by analyzing historical query patterns and adapting to changing data distributions. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that HetOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
