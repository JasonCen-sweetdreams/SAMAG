This paper addresses the problem of distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities need to be assigned to tasks with diverse requirements. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn effective task allocation policies. Our method, called 'AgentTaskAllocator', uses a decentralized, communication-efficient framework to enable agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing task demands. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that AgentTaskAllocator outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
