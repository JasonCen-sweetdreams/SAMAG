Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to significantly enhance the lives of individuals with visual impairments. However, current VR systems often neglect the needs of this population, resulting in inaccessible and frustrating experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interactions that cater to users with visual impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and opportunities, and developed a set of guidelines for inclusive VR design. Our approach focuses on multimodal feedback, audio-based navigation, and personalized assistance. We evaluated our framework through a prototype VR application, demonstrating significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction.
