Time-series databases have become increasingly popular in various domains, including finance, IoT, and healthcare. However, efficient query processing remains a significant challenge due to the high volume and velocity of data. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'TS-Tree', which leverages the temporal and spatial correlations in time-series data to accelerate query execution. Our approach combines a hierarchical tree structure with a compact representation of time-series data, enabling fast range queries and efficient aggregation operations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TS-Tree outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage efficiency.
