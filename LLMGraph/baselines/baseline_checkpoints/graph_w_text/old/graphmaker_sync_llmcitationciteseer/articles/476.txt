Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it can significantly impact the retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. Our method, called DQN-QE, leverages a deep neural network to learn a semantic representation of the query and its related terms. The learned representation is then used to expand the original query, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DQN-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
