Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed database systems, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of the system. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which can be suboptimal and inefficient. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. Our approach uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan from a large state-action space. Experimental results on a realistic distributed database benchmark show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
