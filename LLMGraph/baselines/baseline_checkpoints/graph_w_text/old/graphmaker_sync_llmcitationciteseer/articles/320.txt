Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human-computer interaction. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge in VR environments. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 120 participants, who interacted with either a personalized or a generic avatar in a VR game. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, as measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported enjoyment. We also identify key factors influencing avatar personalization, including facial likeness and body type. Our findings have implications for the design of engaging VR experiences and the role of avatars in HCI.
