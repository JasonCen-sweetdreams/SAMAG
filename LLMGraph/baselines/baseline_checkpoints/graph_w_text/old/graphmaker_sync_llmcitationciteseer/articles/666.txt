Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in information retrieval, where query expansion techniques aim to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeurEx', that leverages deep neural ranking models to learn semantic associations between query terms and relevant documents. Our method integrates a relevance-based attention mechanism to weigh the importance of expanded terms, allowing for more accurate retrieval. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc track demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
