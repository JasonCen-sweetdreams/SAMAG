Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and behavior in VR environments. We conducted a controlled experiment with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to interact with either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, improved task performance, and higher self-reported presence and enjoyment. We also identify key factors influencing avatar personalization, including facial features, body shape, and clothing style. The findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to enhance user experience and encourage long-term adoption.
