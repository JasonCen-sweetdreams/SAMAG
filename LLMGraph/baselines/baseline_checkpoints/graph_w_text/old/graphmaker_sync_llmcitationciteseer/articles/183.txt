Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. However, most existing ERS methods rely on shallow user-item interactions, failing to capture complex relationships between users and items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model, which leverages graph neural networks to capture hierarchical relationships between users and items. Our approach uses attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant user and item features, providing transparent and interpretable recommendations. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and explainability.
