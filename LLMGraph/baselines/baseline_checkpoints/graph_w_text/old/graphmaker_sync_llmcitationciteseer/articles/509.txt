Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their complexity can create barriers for older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible conversational interfaces tailored to this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with cognitive impairments, resulting in a set of design principles and guidelines for simplifying conversation flows, enhancing feedback, and promoting user autonomy. Our prototype, 'EasyChat', demonstrates the feasibility of these principles, improving user experience and reducing errors by 35% compared to commercial conversational interfaces.
