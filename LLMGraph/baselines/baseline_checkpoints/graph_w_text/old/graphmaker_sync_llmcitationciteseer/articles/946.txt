Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but creating an optimal user experience is crucial for widespread adoption. This paper investigates the effects of personalization on user experience in VR, focusing on individual differences in cognitive styles and preferences. We designed a VR-based experiment with 120 participants, manipulating the levels of personalization in a virtual environment. Our results show that personalized VR experiences lead to significant improvements in user engagement, satisfaction, and cognitive load reduction, particularly for users with stronger cognitive styles. The findings have implications for the design of VR systems that cater to diverse user populations.
