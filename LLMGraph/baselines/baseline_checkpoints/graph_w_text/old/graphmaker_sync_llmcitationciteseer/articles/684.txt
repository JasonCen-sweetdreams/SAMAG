In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn agent-agent and agent-task relationships. Our approach, called GNN-TA, uses a distributed architecture to enable agents to communicate and negotiate task assignments in real-time. We evaluate GNN-TA on a variety of benchmark scenarios, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized and decentralized allocation methods.
