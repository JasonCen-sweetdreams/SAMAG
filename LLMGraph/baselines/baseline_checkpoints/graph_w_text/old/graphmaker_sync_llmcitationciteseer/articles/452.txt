Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent in various aspects of daily life, from smart home devices to healthcare systems. However, older adults with cognitive impairments often struggle to engage with these systems due to their complex and dynamic nature. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop accessible conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design principles and guidelines for creating intuitive, error-tolerant, and supportive conversational systems. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and multimodal feedback in facilitating effective communication and reducing cognitive load.
