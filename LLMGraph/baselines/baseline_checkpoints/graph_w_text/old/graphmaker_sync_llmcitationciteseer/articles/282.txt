Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, where models are required to adapt to new classes with limited training data. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach, Hierarchical Prototypical Networks (HPN), which leverages hierarchical representations to capture intra-class variability and inter-class relationships. HPN learns to generate prototypical embeddings for each class, which are then used to adapt to new classes with few examples. We evaluate HPN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average accuracy of 85.2% on 5-way 1-shot classification tasks.
