In multi-agent systems, negotiation is a crucial mechanism for resolving conflicts and reaching mutually beneficial agreements. However, when agents possess incomplete information about each other's preferences or intentions, the negotiation process becomes increasingly complex. This paper proposes a decentralized negotiation strategy, '-information diffusion', which enables agents to adaptively share and update their beliefs about other agents' preferences. We formalize the negotiation problem as a partially observable Markov decision process and develop a scalable algorithm for computing approximate Nash equilibria. Experimental results on a variety of negotiation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving better outcomes and improved communication efficiency compared to existing methods.
