Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our approach, called QOPT-RL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plan based on the database statistics and query workload. We evaluate QOPT-RL on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
