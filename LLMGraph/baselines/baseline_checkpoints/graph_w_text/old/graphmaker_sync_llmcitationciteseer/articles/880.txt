Multi-agent pathfinding is a challenging problem in AI, particularly in dynamic environments with limited resources. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve the efficiency and scalability of multi-agent pathfinding. We propose a hierarchical framework, 'MAP-DRL', which combines a graph-based representation of the environment with a DRL agent that learns to optimize path planning for multiple agents. Experimental results demonstrate that MAP-DRL outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality and computation time, making it a promising solution for real-world applications such as robotic navigation and traffic management.
