Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a crucial challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR system using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, emotional arousal, and overall satisfaction. Furthermore, we found that the impact of personalized avatars is moderated by individual differences in personality traits, such as extraversion and narcissism. The findings have implications for the design of VR systems and the development of more effective human-computer interfaces.
