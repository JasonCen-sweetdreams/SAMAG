Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable time series anomaly detection. Our approach learns a hierarchical representation of time series data, enabling the model to focus on relevant segments and features. We introduce an attention-based anomaly scoring mechanism that provides insights into the detected anomalies. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our HAN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for the detected anomalies.
