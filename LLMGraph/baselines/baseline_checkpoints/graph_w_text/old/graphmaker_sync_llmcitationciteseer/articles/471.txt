Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a crucial technique for AI applications. However, existing methods struggle to capture complex relationships and hierarchical structures in large-scale knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a novel KGE approach, HyperKGE, which leverages adaptive hyperbolic geometry to better model hierarchical and asymmetric relationships. We introduce a dynamic curvature adaptation mechanism that adjusts the hyperbolic space to the local structure of the graph, improving embedding quality and reducing computational cost. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperKGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction and triplet classification tasks.
