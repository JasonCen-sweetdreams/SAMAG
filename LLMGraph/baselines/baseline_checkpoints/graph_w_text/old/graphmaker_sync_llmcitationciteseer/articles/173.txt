 Neural ranking models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but their computational complexity hinders their deployment in large-scale search engines. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking architecture, 'Hi-Ranking', which leverages a two-stage ranking process to reduce the number of neural network evaluations. The first stage employs a lightweight neural model to filter out irrelevant documents, while the second stage fine-tunes the ranking using a more accurate, but computationally expensive, model. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Hi-Ranking achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency while maintaining competitive ranking performance.
