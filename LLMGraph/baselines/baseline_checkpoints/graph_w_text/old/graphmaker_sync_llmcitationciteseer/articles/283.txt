Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant that accommodates the unique challenges faced by this population. We conducted a series of interviews and usability studies to identify design requirements and developed a prototype that incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified language, visual cues, and error tolerance. Our evaluation shows that the proposed design significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction for older adults with cognitive impairments.
