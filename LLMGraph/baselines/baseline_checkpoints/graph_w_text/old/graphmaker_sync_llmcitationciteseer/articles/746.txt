In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. We propose a novel framework, 'CATAR', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to coordinate task allocation among agents. CATAR uses a decentralized, actor-critic architecture to learn optimal task assignment policies, taking into account agent capabilities, task dependencies, and environmental constraints. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that CATAR outperforms traditional, rule-based allocation methods in terms of task completion time and success rate.
