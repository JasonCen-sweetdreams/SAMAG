Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges when interacting with modern computing systems. This paper presents a novel adaptive gesture recognition framework, 'AGReS', which leverages machine learning and computer vision to recognize and accommodate diverse gesture patterns. AGReS incorporates a modular architecture, enabling real-time adaptation to user abilities and preferences. We evaluate AGReS with a user study involving 20 participants with varying motor impairments, demonstrating improved recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing gesture recognition systems.
