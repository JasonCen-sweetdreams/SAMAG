Query expansion is a crucial component of information retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs). Our method leverages the hierarchical structure of word embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and expand the query to relevant keywords. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. We also provide an analysis of the robustness of our method to query ambiguity and noise.
