Distributed database systems face significant challenges in maintaining query performance as data grows and user requests increase. This paper proposes an adaptive replication strategy, 'AdaptRep', which dynamically adjusts data replication based on query patterns and system workload. We develop a novel cost model that captures the trade-offs between data replication, query latency, and storage overhead. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AdaptRep outperforms existing replication strategies, achieving up to 30% reduction in query latency and 25% reduction in storage overhead.
