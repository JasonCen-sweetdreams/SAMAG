Time series forecasting models often suffer from a lack of interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable time series forecasting. Our approach leverages a multi-level attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant features and time steps, providing insights into the model's decision-making process. We evaluate the proposed HAN model on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved forecasting accuracy and enhanced interpretability compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.
