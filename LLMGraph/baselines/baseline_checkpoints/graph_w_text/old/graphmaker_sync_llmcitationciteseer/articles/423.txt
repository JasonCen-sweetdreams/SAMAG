Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the high cognitive load associated with navigating complex VR interfaces. This paper presents a mixed-methods study that investigates the relationship between cognitive load, user experience, and performance in VR. We developed a novel cognitive load measurement framework, which combines physiological and behavioral metrics, and applied it to a VR-based task. Our results show that high cognitive load significantly deteriorates user experience and performance, and that individual differences in cognitive abilities play a crucial role in VR usage. The findings have implications for the design of more user-centered and accessible VR interfaces.
