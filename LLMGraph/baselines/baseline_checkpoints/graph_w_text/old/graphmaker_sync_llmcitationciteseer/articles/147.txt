In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the underlying agent-agent and agent-task relationships. By representing the system as a graph, our approach can capture complex dependencies and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through simulations on a variety of scenarios, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
