As robots become increasingly integrated into human society, understanding how people perceive and interact with them is crucial. This paper investigates the effect of robotic embodiment on social perception, specifically exploring how varying levels of humanoid features influence user trust, likability, and perceived intelligence. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants interacting with three robots differing in embodiment, and analyzed the results using a combination of surveys, interviews, and physiological metrics. Our findings suggest that moderate levels of humanoid features lead to increased trust and likability, but may not necessarily enhance perceived intelligence.
