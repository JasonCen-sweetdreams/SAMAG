In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal assignment policies. Our approach, called 'AgentRL', utilizes a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn task-specific value functions. We evaluate AgentRL on a variety of benchmark scenarios, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized allocation methods.
