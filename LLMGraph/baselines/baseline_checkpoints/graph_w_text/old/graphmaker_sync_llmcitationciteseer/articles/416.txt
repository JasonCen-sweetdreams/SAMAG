Existing time series anomaly detection methods often rely on complex models that are difficult to interpret. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Neural Network (HAT) architecture that integrates attention mechanisms to identify anomalies while providing explainability. HAT uses a hierarchical structure to model temporal dependencies and attention weights to highlight relevant features. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting anomalies while offering insights into the anomaly detection process.
