This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent task allocation, leveraging hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to efficiently assign tasks to agents in complex, dynamic environments. Our method, TaskAlloc-HGNN, exploits the hierarchical structure of task graphs to reduce the computational complexity of traditional task allocation algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TaskAlloc-HGNN through extensive simulations on various task allocation benchmarks, showcasing improved scalability and reduced assignment errors compared to state-of-the-art methods.
