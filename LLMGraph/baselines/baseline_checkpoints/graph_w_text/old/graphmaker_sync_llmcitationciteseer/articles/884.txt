Deep neural ranking models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but their performance can be hindered by the limited context provided by short queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using a combination of word embeddings and convolutional neural networks. Our model, dubbed 'QueryExpander', learns to identify relevant terms and expand the query to improve the retrieval of relevant documents. Experimental results on the TREC benchmark dataset demonstrate that QueryExpander outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and recall.
