Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence, enabling organizations to respond promptly to changing market conditions. However, indexing schemes, a critical component of RTDW, often struggle to keep pace with high-velocity data ingestion and query workloads. This paper presents 'AdaptiveIX', a novel indexing framework that leverages machine learning to predict data access patterns and adaptively reconfigure index structures in response to changing query distributions. Our experimental evaluation using a realistic RTDW benchmark demonstrates that AdaptiveIX achieves up to 3x query performance improvement and 2x storage savings compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
