We propose a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task assignments. Each agent maintains a local GNN model, which incorporates information from neighboring agents to predict task preferences and availability. Our approach enables agents to adapt to dynamic task environments and optimize system-level performance. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional auction-based methods.
