Virtual reality (VR) interfaces rely heavily on user input, but existing methods often struggle to accurately interpret user intent. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages eye movement analysis to predict user intent in VR environments. We propose a machine learning model that combines gaze tracking data with semantic scene understanding to accurately identify user goals. Our evaluation on a public VR dataset shows that our approach achieves a 25% increase in intent prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We discuss implications for improving VR user experience and potential applications in fields such as gaming, education, and healthcare.
