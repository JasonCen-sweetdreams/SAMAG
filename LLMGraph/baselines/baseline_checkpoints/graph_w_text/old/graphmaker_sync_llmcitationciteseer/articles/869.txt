Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving and ranking relevant documents to answer a user's query. While traditional methods rely on keyword matching and handcrafted features, we propose a deep neural network-based approach for document re-ranking. Our model, called QRN, leverages pre-trained language models and fine-tunes them on a large ODQA dataset. QRN uses a combination of semantic and syntactic features to re-rank documents, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that QRN outperforms strong baselines, including BERT-based models, in terms of both retrieval accuracy and answer correctness.
