In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'CATARINA', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to coordinate task allocation among agents. We model the task allocation problem as a decentralized Markov decision process and train a graph neural network to learn a cooperative policy. Experimental results on a simulated robotic exploration scenario demonstrate that CATARINA outperforms existing algorithms in terms of task completion rate and adaptability to dynamic environments.
