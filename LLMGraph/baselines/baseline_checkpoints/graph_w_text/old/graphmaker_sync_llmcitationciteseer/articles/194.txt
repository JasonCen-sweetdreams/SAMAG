Few-shot relation classification is a challenging task in natural language processing, where the goal is to classify relations between entities in a sentence given only a few examples. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages graph structures to model entity interactions and attention mechanisms to focus on relevant context. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark datasets, achieving an average improvement of 5.2% in F1-score on the FewRel dataset. We also provide an extensive ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in HGAT.
