With the rapid growth of digital data, search engines face significant challenges in efficiently retrieving relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, HiQE, which leverages both semantic and syntactic relationships between query terms to generate more effective query representations. We introduce a graph-based model that captures the contextual dependencies between query terms, enabling more accurate document ranking. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HiQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 23% improvement in mean average precision.
