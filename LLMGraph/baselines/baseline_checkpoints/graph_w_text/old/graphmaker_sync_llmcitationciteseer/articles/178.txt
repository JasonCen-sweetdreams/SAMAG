Voice assistants have the potential to greatly improve the quality of life for individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder characterized by difficulties with articulation, phonation, and respiration. However, existing voice assistants often struggle to accurately recognize and respond to users with dysarthria. This paper presents a co-design approach to developing accessible voice assistants, involving users with dysarthria in the design and testing process. We propose a novel speech recognition system that leverages machine learning and acoustic modeling to improve recognition accuracy for users with dysarthria. Our user study demonstrates significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
