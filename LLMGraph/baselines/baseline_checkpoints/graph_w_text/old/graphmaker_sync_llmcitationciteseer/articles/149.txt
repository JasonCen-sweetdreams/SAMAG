Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which can lead to suboptimal plans. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based query optimization framework, 'RL-Opt', which learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system. RL-Opt uses a deep Q-network to predict the optimal query plan, taking into account various factors such as data distribution, system workload, and query patterns. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database system demonstrates that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by an average of 30% in terms of query execution time.
