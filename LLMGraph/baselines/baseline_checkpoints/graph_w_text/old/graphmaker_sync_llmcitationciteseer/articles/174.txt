Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture query context, leading to suboptimal ranking performance. This paper proposes a neural re-ranking approach that incorporates context-aware query embeddings. Our method, 'ConQE', leverages a novel attention-based architecture to model query-term interactions and contextualize query representations. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ranking quality, with ConQE outperforming state-of-the-art neural re-ranking models. We also show that ConQE's contextualized query embeddings enable more effective transfer learning across different retrieval tasks.
