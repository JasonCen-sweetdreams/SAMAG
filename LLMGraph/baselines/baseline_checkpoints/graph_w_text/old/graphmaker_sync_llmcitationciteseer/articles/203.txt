Query optimization is a critical component of relational database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and system scalability. In distributed relational databases, query optimization becomes increasingly complex due to the need to consider data distribution, communication costs, and node heterogeneity. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to optimize queries through trial and error. Our RL-based optimizer, 'DQO', uses a graph neural network to model the query optimization problem and a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plan. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that DQO outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
