Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources to meet dynamic workloads. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework to optimize resource allocation in cloud computing. Our approach consists of a high-level policy that selects the most suitable allocation strategy and a low-level policy that adjusts the allocation parameters. We evaluate our framework using a realistic cloud simulation environment and demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and energy efficiency compared to traditional heuristics. The proposed HRL framework can be easily integrated with existing cloud management systems to enhance their performance and scalability.
