This paper addresses the problem of task allocation for autonomous agents in decentralized systems, where agents have limited communication and computation resources. We propose a novel distributed constraint optimization framework, 'D-COPT', which enables agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a decentralized manner. D-COPT leverages constraint propagation and iterative improvement techniques to find near-optimal solutions that satisfy agent capabilities and task requirements. Experimental results on a simulation platform demonstrate the effectiveness of D-COPT in reducing communication overhead and improving system performance compared to centralized task allocation methods.
