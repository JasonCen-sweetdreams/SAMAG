With the increasing popularity of distributed databases, optimizing query execution has become a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan from a large search space. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional query optimization techniques. Our results show that RL-Optimizer can reduce query execution time by up to 50% while improving resource utilization.
