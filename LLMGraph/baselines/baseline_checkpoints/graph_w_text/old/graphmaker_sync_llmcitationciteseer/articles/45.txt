Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly popular, but users often struggle with errors due to the lack of tactile feedback. This paper explores the role of auditory feedback in preventing gesture recognition errors. We designed and evaluated three novel sound feedback strategies that provide users with real-time feedback on their gesture performance. Our user study involving 30 participants showed that our approach significantly reduced error rates and improved user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-only feedback. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing more effective and accessible gesture-based interfaces.
