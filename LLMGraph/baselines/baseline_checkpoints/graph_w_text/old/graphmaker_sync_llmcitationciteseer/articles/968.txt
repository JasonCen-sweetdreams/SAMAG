This paper proposes a novel approach to cooperative task allocation for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, called 'MACTR', leverages a decentralized actor-critic framework to enable agents to learn and adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MACTR in a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario, achieving significant improvements in task completion efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional optimization-based approaches.
