Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the need to minimize communication overhead. This paper presents 'GraphOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages a combination of graph summarization, query rewriting, and distributed execution planning. Our experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt achieves an average speedup of 3.5x over state-of-the-art query optimization techniques while maintaining result accuracy.
