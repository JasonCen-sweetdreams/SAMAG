Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to be assigned to tasks with diverse requirements. This paper proposes a novel graph-based reinforcement learning approach to tackle this problem. We model the task allocation problem as a graph, where agents and tasks are represented as nodes, and edges capture the compatibility and feasibility of assignments. Our algorithm, called Graph-TA, learns to optimize task assignments by iteratively updating the graph structure and exploring the space of possible allocations. Experimental results on a range of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that Graph-TA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time, agent satisfaction, and system efficiency.
