Entity disambiguation is a critical step in knowledge graph construction, but existing methods struggle with scalability and accuracy. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based approach, 'HAT-ED', that leverages the structural properties of knowledge graphs to disambiguate entities efficiently. Our method uses a multi-layered attention mechanism to capture both local and global contextual information, enabling accurate disambiguation even in large-scale graphs. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAT-ED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
