Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data analysis, but the lack of interpretability hinders its adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges, enabling explainable node classification. We propose a hierarchical aggregation scheme that recursively applies attention to capture complex relationships between nodes. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HGAT in achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable insights into the classification process.
