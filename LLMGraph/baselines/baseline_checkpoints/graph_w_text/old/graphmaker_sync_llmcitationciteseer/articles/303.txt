This paper addresses the problem of cooperative task planning for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities need to coordinate to achieve complex tasks. We propose a decentralized approach using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to solve the task planning problem. Our method, called DCOP-TP, leverages agent-level constraint propagation and iterative improvement to find near-optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DCOP-TP outperforms existing centralized and decentralized planning methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
