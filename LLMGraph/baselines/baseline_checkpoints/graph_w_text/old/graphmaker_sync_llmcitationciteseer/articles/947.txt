Coordinating task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, especially in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enable agents to learn effective task allocation strategies. We introduce a decentralized, communication-based framework that leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and a hierarchical DRL architecture to optimize task allocation. Experimental results in a simulated robotics environment demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
