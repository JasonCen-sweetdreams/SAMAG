Explainable recommendation systems have gained increasing attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that incorporates both item-level and user-level graph structures to provide personalized explanations for recommendation results. Our model leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant items and users, and generates interpretable explanations through a hierarchical graph-based visualization. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
