In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects the overall performance and efficiency of the system. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn optimal task assignments. We introduce a novel reward function that incorporates both individual and global performance metrics, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated environment with varying agent and task dynamics. Experimental results show significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
