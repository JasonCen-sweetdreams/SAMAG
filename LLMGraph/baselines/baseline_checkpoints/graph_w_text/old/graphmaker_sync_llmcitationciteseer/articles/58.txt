Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc search, but existing methods often suffer from high computational costs and limited accuracy. This paper proposes a hybrid retrieval model, 'HyREX', which combines the strengths of lexical and semantic query expansion techniques. HyREX leverages a neural network-based dense passage retriever to identify relevant documents and then applies a lexical expansion module to generate a robust set of expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that HyREX outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
