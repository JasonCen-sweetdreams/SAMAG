Medical information retrieval (IR) systems often struggle to accurately capture the nuances of medical terminology, leading to poor query performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages word embeddings to better represent medical concepts. Our approach, called MedEmb, uses a combination of word2vec and GloVe embeddings to generate context-aware expansions of medical queries. Experimental results on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, with a 15% increase in precision and 20% increase in recall compared to traditional query expansion methods.
