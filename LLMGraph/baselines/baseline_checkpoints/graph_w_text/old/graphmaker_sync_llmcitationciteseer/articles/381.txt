Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their accessibility and usability for older adults remain limited. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify key challenges and opportunities for improving Voice Assistant (VA) interactions. Our findings highlight the importance of adapting VA responses to accommodate age-related cognitive and sensory changes. We propose a set of design guidelines for VA developers and evaluate their effectiveness through a usability study with older adults.
