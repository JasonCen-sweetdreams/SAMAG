Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and provide high availability. However, query optimization in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages both vertical and horizontal partitioning strategies to minimize query execution times. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that considers both data locality and network latency to generate efficient query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
