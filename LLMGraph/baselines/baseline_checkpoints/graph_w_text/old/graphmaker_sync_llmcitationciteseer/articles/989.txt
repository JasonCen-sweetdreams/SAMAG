Neural ranking models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but their computational complexity hinders their deployment in large-scale search engines. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'NeurIX', which accelerates neural ranking models by exploiting the structural properties of the index. We propose a hierarchical index organization that facilitates efficient candidate generation and scoring, reducing the number of neural network invocations by up to 90%. Experimental results on the MS MARCO dataset show that NeurIX achieves significant speedups while maintaining the ranking performance of the underlying neural models.
