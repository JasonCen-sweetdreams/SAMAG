Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages deep neural networks to learn a dense representation of query terms and their context. Our approach, called 'NeuroExp', uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to capture both local and global patterns in the query and document language models. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExp outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and NDCG@10.
