The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential growth in time-series data, posing significant challenges for efficient data management. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'TS-Index', which leverages a combination of bitap compression and segmented tree structures to support fast range queries and aggregations. Our experimental evaluation on real-world IoT datasets demonstrates that TS-Index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time and storage efficiency, making it an attractive solution for large-scale IoT applications.
