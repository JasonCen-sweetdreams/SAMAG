Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph structural properties and distributed indexing techniques to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world social network dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing query optimization techniques.
