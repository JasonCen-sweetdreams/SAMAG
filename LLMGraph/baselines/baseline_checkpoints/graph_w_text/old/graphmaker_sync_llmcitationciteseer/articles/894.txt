Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We develop a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with a distributed database system simulator. Our approach takes into account various factors such as data distribution, network latency, and node heterogeneity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving up to 30% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in resource utilization.
