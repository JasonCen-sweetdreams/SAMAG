Time series forecasting with irregularly sampled data is a challenging problem in many real-world applications. Existing methods often rely on interpolation or imputation, which can be computationally expensive and may not capture complex patterns. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that learns to focus on relevant time steps and features, while adaptively handling missing values. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and computational efficiency.
