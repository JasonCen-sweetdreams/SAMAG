Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods often rely on simplistic user-item interaction graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that captures complex relationships between users, items, and their attributes. HGAT leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on important nodes and edges in the graph, generating more accurate and interpretable recommendations. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in both recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
