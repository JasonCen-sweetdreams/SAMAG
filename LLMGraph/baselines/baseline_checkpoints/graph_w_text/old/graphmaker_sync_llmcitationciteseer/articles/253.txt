This paper presents a gamification framework for designing persuasive interfaces that promote sustainable behavior in everyday life. We conducted a user study to investigate the impact of various gamification elements, such as points, badges, and leaderboards, on users' energy consumption habits. Our results show that a well-designed gamified interface can lead to a significant reduction in energy usage, with an average decrease of 23.4% among participants. We also identify key design principles and guidelines for creating effective persuasive interfaces that encourage sustainable behavior.
