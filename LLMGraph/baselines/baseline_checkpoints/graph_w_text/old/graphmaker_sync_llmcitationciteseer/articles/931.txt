Effective query expansion is crucial for retrieving relevant documents in specialized domains, where domain-specific terminology and relationships are essential. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-SD', that leverages domain knowledge graphs to identify relevant expansion terms. HQE-SD employs a two-stage process: first, it generates a set of candidate expansion terms using graph-based methods, and then, it applies a ranking model to select the most informative terms. Experiments on three specialized domains (medicine, law, and computer science) demonstrate that HQE-SD outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
