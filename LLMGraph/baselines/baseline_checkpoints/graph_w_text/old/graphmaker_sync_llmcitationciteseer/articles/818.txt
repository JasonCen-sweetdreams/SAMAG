Multi-agent systems require effective decision-making strategies that balance individual goals with collective outcomes. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in cooperative multi-agent settings. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to identify influential agents and integrate their contributions into a shared decision-making process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate and interpretability of agent interactions.
