Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on hand-tuned heuristics or complex modeling, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans. We introduce a scalable RL framework that learns to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies based on query workload and system characteristics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
