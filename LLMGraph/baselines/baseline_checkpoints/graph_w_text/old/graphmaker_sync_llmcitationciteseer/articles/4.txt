In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a fundamental problem that affects overall system performance. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach, called 'MA-RL', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that maps agent capabilities to task requirements. We evaluate MA-RL in a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to traditional centralized and heuristic-based approaches. The proposed framework is scalable, flexible, and adaptable to dynamic changes in the system.
