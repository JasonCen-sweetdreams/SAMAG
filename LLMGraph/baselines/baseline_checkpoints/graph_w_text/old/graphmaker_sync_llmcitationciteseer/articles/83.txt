In this paper, we explore the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) to decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems. We propose a novel framework, 'GNN-TA', which leverages the structural properties of agent interaction graphs to learn effective task assignment policies. Our approach enables agents to make local decisions based on their immediate neighbors, eliminating the need for centralized control. We evaluate GNN-TA on a range of synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional decentralized allocation methods.
