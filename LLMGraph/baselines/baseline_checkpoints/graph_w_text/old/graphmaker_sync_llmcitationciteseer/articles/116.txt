Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and expertise need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to optimize task allocation in decentralized settings. We introduce a graph neural network-based agent architecture that learns to communicate and negotiate with other agents to allocate tasks effectively. Experimental results on a realistic transportation domain demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
