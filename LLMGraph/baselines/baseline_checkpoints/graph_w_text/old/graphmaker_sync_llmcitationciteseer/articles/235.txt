Dense retrieval models have revolutionized the field of information retrieval by enabling the use of neural networks to directly encode queries and documents into dense vector spaces. However, these models can be computationally expensive and often require significant computational resources. This paper proposes a novel approach to deep query reformulation, which leverages the strengths of both lexical and dense retrieval models. Our approach uses a neural query reformulator to generate an optimal set of lexical queries, which are then used to retrieve a set of relevant passages. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, while reducing the computational cost by up to 50%.
