This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent pathfinding using deep reinforcement learning. We introduce a hierarchical framework that combines a high-level graph-based planner with a low-level neural network controller. The planner generates a coarse plan, which is then refined by the controller using a learned policy. We evaluate our approach on a set of challenging scenarios and demonstrate significant improvements in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency compared to existing methods. Our results have implications for applications such as autonomous vehicle routing and warehouse logistics.
