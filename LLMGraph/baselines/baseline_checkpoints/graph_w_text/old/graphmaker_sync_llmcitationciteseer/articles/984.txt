Multi-agent planning has gained significant attention in recent years, but explainability of the planning process remains a major challenge. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HiGAT) that integrates planning and explanation generation in a unified framework. HiGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent interactions and applies hierarchical reasoning to identify key factors influencing the planning decisions. Experimental results on a range of multi-agent planning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HiGAT in improving planning efficiency and generating human-understandable explanations.
