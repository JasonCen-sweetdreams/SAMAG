In multi-agent systems, effective negotiation is crucial to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. This paper presents a novel adaptive negotiation strategy, 'DynANeg', which leverages reinforcement learning to adjust negotiation tactics in response to changing environmental conditions. We model the negotiation process as a partially observable Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn optimal policies. Experimental results in a simulated smart grid environment demonstrate that DynANeg outperforms state-of-the-art negotiation strategies in terms of both individual and social welfare. Our approach has significant implications for real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles and smart cities.
