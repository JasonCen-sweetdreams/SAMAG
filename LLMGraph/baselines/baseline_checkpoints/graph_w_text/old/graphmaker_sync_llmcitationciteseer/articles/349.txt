Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using reinforcement learning, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on its local observations and interactions with other agents. We introduce a novel reward function that encourages agents to explore diverse task assignments and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional centralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
