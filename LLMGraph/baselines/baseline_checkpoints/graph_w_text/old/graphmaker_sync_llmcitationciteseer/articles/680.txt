In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We formulate the task allocation problem as a DCOP and develop a novel algorithm, called DACOP, that leverages the benefits of both constraint optimization and distributed problem-solving. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that DACOP outperforms existing decentralized approaches in terms of solution quality and communication overhead.
