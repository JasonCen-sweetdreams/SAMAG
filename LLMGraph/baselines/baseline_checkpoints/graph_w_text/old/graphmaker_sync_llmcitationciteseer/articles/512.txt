The increasing proliferation of IoT devices has necessitated efficient resource allocation mechanisms to mitigate network congestion and optimize performance. This paper proposes a decentralized agent-based framework, 'DARA', which leverages autonomous agents to negotiate and allocate resources in IoT networks. By integrating game-theoretic models with reinforcement learning, DARA enables agents to adapt to dynamic network conditions and make decisions that balance individual objectives with global optimality. Simulation results demonstrate that DARA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of resource utilization, latency, and network reliability.
