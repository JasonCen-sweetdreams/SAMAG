Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but the emotional impact of these experiences on users remains understudied. This paper presents 'EmoVR', a novel affective computing framework that detects and responds to users' emotional states in real-time, promoting emotional well-being in VR environments. Our approach combines machine learning-based emotion recognition from physiological signals and natural language processing-based sentiment analysis. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that EmoVR reduces anxiety and increases feelings of relaxation and calmness in VR users.
