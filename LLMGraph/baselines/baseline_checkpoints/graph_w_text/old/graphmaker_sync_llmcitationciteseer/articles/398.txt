Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide transparency and trustworthiness to users. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable recommendation systems. Our approach incorporates both item-level and user-level attention mechanisms, enabling the model to capture complex relationships between users, items, and their features. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of HAN in improving recommendation accuracy and providing meaningful explanations for its predictions.
