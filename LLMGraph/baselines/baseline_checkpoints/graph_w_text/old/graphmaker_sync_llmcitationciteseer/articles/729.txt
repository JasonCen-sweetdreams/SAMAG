Distributed column-store databases have become increasingly popular for big data analytics, but indexing remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing scheme, 'CIForest', which exploits the inherent columnar structure of the data to reduce indexing overhead. CIForest utilizes a hierarchical forest of indices, where each node is a compact, probabilistic representation of the underlying data distribution. We demonstrate that CIForest outperforms existing indexing techniques in terms of query performance, storage efficiency, and scalability. Experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that CIForest achieves up to 3x faster query execution and 2x better storage compression compared to state-of-the-art methods.
