Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a crucial component in various AI applications, but their complex multi-relational structure poses a significant challenge for effective embedding. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) for KG embedding, which captures both entity and relation semantics. Our approach employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant relations and entities, enabling the model to learn more informative and discriminative embeddings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction, entity classification, and question answering tasks.
