In multi-agent systems, understanding the decision-making process of individual agents is crucial for effective collaboration and trust. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent environments. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant features and agents, while a hierarchical architecture captures complex relationships between agents. We evaluate our method on a real-world autonomous vehicle dataset, demonstrating improved decision accuracy and interpretability compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
