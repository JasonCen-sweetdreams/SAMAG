Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular in modern data management systems. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complex interactions between nodes and the exponential growth of possible execution plans. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query plan policy. Our approach, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a Deep Q-Network to learn from query execution experiences and adapts to changing database workloads. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional optimization methods by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
