Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of the system. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workloads and system conditions. Our approach, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy that minimizes execution time and resource utilization. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database system and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
