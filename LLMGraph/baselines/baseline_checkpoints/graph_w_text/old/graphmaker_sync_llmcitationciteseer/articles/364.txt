Stroke survivors often face significant motor skill impairments, hindering their ability to engage in rehabilitation exercises. This paper investigates the potential of gestural interfaces in enhancing the rehabilitation experience. We designed and implemented a gesture-based system, 'RehabGest', which utilizes machine learning-driven gesture recognition to facilitate exercise tracking and feedback. A user study with 20 post-stroke patients demonstrated significant improvements in motor function and user engagement compared to traditional rehabilitation methods. Our findings highlight the promise of gestural interfaces in improving rehabilitation outcomes and patient quality of life.
