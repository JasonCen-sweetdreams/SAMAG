Main-memory databases have revolutionized query performance, but indexing techniques for multi-dimensional range queries remain inefficient. We propose a novel indexing approach, 'SkyBox', which partitions the data space using a hierarchical grid-based structure. SkyBox leverages the memory-resident property to minimize page faults and optimize query processing. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that SkyBox outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage efficiency.
