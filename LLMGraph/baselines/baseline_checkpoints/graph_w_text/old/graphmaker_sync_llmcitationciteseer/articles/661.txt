Node classification in heterogeneous graphs is a crucial task in various applications, such as social network analysis and recommender systems. Existing graph neural network (GNN) models often struggle to capture the complex relationships between nodes with different types and features. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN (HAT-GNN) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant node features and neighbors. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, outperforming popular GNN models by up to 10% in terms of F1-score. We also provide theoretical analysis and insights into the effectiveness of our proposed model.
