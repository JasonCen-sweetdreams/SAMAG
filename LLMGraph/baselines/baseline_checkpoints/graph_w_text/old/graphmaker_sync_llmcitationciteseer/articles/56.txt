Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is a challenging problem, particularly in the presence of complex patterns and correlations. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering-based approach, 'HiCAD', which leverages the strengths of both density-based and distance-based methods. HiCAD uses a multi-resolution representation of the data to identify anomalies at different scales, and incorporates a robust outlier scoring mechanism to handle noisy and imbalanced data. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HiCAD in detecting anomalies with high accuracy and efficiency.
