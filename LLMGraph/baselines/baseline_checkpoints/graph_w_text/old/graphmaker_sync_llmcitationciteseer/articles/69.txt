Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) enables fast analytics on constantly changing data, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents an optimization framework, 'RTMV', which leverages materialized views to accelerate query execution in RTDW. We propose a novel view selection algorithm that considers both query frequency and data freshness, and a caching mechanism that adaptively adjusts view refresh rates based on system workload. Experimental results on a benchmarks dataset demonstrate that RTMV reduces average query latency by up to 3x compared to traditional view-less approaches, while maintaining high data freshness and consistency.
