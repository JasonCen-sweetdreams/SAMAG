The proliferation of online services has led to an exponential growth in user-item interaction data, making traditional recommendation systems increasingly inefficient. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages the hierarchical structure of user-item relationships to efficiently model complex interactions. By incorporating graph attention mechanisms at multiple scales, HGAT achieves significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and scalability compared to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of HGAT on multiple benchmark datasets, showcasing its potential for large-scale recommendation systems.
