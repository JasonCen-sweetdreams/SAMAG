Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly improve the recall of relevant documents. However, traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and often fail to capture complex semantic relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn query-term embeddings and expand queries in a more effective and efficient manner. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance while reducing computational overhead.
