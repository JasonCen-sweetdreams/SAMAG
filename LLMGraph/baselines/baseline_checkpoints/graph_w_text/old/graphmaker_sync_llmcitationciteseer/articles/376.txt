In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and resources need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. We develop a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, 'MALTA', that enables agents to learn optimal task allocation policies in a distributed manner. MALTA leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to handle heterogeneous agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that MALTA outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization efficiency.
