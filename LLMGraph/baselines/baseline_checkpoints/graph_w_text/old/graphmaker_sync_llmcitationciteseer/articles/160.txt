This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent coalition formation using distributed constraint optimization. We propose a scalable algorithm that enables agents to form coalitions while respecting constraints on resource allocation, task dependencies, and communication costs. Our approach leverages a decentralized constraint programming framework that allows agents to iteratively refine their coalition membership and task assignments. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing centralized methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale multi-agent systems.
