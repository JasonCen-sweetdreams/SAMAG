In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive task allocation using reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'AgentTA', which enables agents to learn task allocation strategies through interactions with their environment. AgentTA incorporates a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture, where agents learn to prioritize tasks based on their capabilities and the system's overall performance. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate that AgentTA outperforms traditional task allocation methods, achieving up to 30% improvement in system throughput.
