Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, which involves reformulating the original query to improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach to query expansion, dubbed 'DeepQE'. Our method leverages a combination of word embeddings and attention mechanisms to learn a robust query representation, which is then used to generate expanded queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, improving the retrieval performance by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
