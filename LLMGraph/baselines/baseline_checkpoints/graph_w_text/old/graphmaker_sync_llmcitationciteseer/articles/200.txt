Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the database system as a graph, where nodes represent data fragments and edges represent communication links. Our GNN-based optimizer, ' DistributedQueryOpt', learns to predict optimal query plans by leveraging the structural properties of the graph. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DistributedQueryOpt outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
