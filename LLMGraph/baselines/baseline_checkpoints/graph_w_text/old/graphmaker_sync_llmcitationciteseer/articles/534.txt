The deep web, comprising hidden databases and unindexed content, poses significant challenges for traditional search engines. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepProbe', which leverages reinforced neural query expansion to efficiently retrieve deep web content. Our method uses a neural network to generate relevant query expansions, which are then refined through reinforcement learning. Experiments on a large-scale deep web dataset demonstrate that DeepProbe outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 30% increase in recall and a 25% reduction in query latency.
