Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepHash', which leverages deep semantic hashing to encode passages and questions into compact binary vectors. By learning to preserve semantic relationships in the hash space, our method enables fast and accurate retrieval of top-k passages. Experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that DeepHash outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and answer accuracy, while requiring significantly less computational resources.
