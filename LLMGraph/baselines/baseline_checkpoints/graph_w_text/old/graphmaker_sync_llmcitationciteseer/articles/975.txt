Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability and accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remain limited. This paper presents an inclusive design framework for voice assistants that caters to the unique needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments and 10 caregivers to identify key challenges and design opportunities. Our framework incorporates cognitive support features, such as personalized reminders, simplified language processing, and multimodal feedback. A usability evaluation of our prototype with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
