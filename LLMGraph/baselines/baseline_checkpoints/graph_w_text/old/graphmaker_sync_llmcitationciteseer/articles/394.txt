Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying reasons behind the detected anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to identify anomalies in time series data. Our approach provides explainable results by highlighting the most relevant segments and features contributing to the anomaly detection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while offering meaningful insights into the decision-making process.
