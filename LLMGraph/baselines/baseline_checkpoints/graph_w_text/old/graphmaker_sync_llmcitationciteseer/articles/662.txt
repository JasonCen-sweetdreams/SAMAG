In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive strategies. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages evolutionary game theory to model the interactions among agents. Our approach, called EvolveAssign, uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a set of strategies that optimize task assignment based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveAssign in a simulated disaster response scenario, where it outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and system resilience.
