The advent of learned index structures has transformed the database community's understanding of query optimization. However, existing query optimizers are ill-equipped to harness the potential of these AI-driven indexing techniques. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'LIXO', which incorporates learned index structures into the optimization pipeline. LIXO leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workloads and indexing strategies, outperforming traditional optimizers in both response time and resource utilization. We demonstrate the efficacy of LIXO on a suite of real-world benchmarks, showcasing its ability to seamlessly integrate with modern database systems.
