Multi-agent systems require efficient decision-making algorithms that can handle complex interactions and uncertain environments. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision making. Our HAN model consists of two stages: (1) an attention-based feature extractor that identifies relevant agents and their interactions, and (2) a hierarchical reasoning module that aggregates features and makes decisions. We evaluate our approach on a real-world traffic management scenario and demonstrate improved decision-making performance and interpretability compared to existing approaches.
