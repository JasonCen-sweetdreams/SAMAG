Ad-hoc search queries often suffer from limited context, leading to inaccurate results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'NeuroQE', which leverages neural semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and relevant documents. By integrating a pre-trained language model with a graph-based ranking algorithm, NeuroQE improves retrieval quality by 23.5% and 17.2% on two benchmark datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques. We also demonstrate the robustness of NeuroQE against query drift and vocabulary mismatch.
