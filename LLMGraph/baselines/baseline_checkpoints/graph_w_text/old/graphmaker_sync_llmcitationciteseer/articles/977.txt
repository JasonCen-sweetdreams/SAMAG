Distributed database systems require efficient query optimization to minimize response times and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed settings. Our framework, 'RLQP', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. Experimental results demonstrate that RLQP outperforms traditional query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization, while adapting to changing workloads and system conditions.
