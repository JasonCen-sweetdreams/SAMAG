Emotion recognition from multi-modal data (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that leverages the strengths of each modality to improve emotion recognition accuracy. Our HAN model consists of three stages: modality-specific attention, cross-modal attention, and hierarchical fusion. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy, F1-score, and computational efficiency.
