The proliferation of social media platforms has led to an explosion in user-generated content, necessitating efficient document retrieval techniques. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-SM', tailored to the unique characteristics of social media data. HQE-SM leverages a combination of keyword extraction, part-of-speech tagging, and semantic role labeling to generate a comprehensive set of expansion terms. Our experiments on a large-scale Twitter dataset demonstrate that HQE-SM outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 23% increase in retrieval precision and a 30% reduction in query processing time.
