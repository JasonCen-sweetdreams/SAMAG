Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal join order, indexing strategy, and data allocation scheme based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. Our experiments on a realistic distributed database setup demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
