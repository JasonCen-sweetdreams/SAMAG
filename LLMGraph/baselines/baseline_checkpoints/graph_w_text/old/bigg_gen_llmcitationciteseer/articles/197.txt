In dynamic and uncertain environments, multi-agent systems require efficient coalition formation mechanisms to allocate tasks in real-time. This paper presents a novel, scalable approach to forming coalitions based on a hierarchical, graph-based clustering algorithm. Our method, called 'HCCF', incorporates both task and agent-centric constraints to optimize coalition structures for improved system performance and adaptability. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that HCCF outperforms existing methods in terms of coalition stability, task completion time, and communication overhead.
