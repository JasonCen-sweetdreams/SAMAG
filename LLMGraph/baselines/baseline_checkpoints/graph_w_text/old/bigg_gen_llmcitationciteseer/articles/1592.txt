Designing interpretable and effective dialogue systems for multi-agent interactions remains a challenging problem. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that integrates agent-specific and dialogue-level attention mechanisms to capture context-dependent relationships between agents. Our approach enables the generation of informative and diverse responses while providing insights into the decision-making process. Experimental results on a large-scale multi-agent dialogue dataset demonstrate improved response quality and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
