Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed graph databases. We design a neural network-based model that learns to predict the optimal query plan based on query patterns, graph topology, and system workload. Our experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
