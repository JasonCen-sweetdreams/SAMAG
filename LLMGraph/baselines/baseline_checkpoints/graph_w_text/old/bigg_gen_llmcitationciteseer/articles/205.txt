Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data management, but optimizing query execution plans in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively learn optimal query plans for a given workload. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to select the most efficient execution plan based on a reward function that balances query latency and system resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of average query response time.
