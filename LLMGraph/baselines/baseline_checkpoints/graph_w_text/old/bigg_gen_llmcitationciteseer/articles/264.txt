In heterogeneous multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework based on deep reinforcement learning, which enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing task requirements and agent capabilities. Our approach uses a multi-agent deep Q-network to learn a policy that maps agent states and task attributes to optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse robotics scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to traditional optimization-based approaches.
