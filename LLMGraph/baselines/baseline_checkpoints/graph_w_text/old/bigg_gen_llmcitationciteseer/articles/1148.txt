Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to efficiently filter out irrelevant documents, leading to poor query response times. This paper introduces GraphRelevance, a novel graph-based approach that propagates relevance scores between documents to identify and filter out non-relevant ones. By modeling document relationships as a graph, we can leverage structural information to improve retrieval efficiency. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset show that GraphRelevance reduces the average query response time by 35% while maintaining a high retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art filtering methods.
