Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it helps to refine user queries and improve search results. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep learning-based word embeddings. We leverage pre-trained word2vec models to capture semantic relationships between words and develop a neural network-based query expansion framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score. We also analyze the impact of different word embedding techniques and neural network architectures on query expansion performance.
