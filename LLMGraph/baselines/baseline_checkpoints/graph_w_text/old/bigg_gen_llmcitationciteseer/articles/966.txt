Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR systems often neglect the unique needs and challenges of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive VR experiences for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and clinicians to identify key design principles and requirements. Our findings highlight the importance of simple, intuitive interfaces, personalized cognitive support, and social interaction features. We also developed a prototype VR system that incorporates these design principles and evaluated its usability and effectiveness with a group of older adults with cognitive impairments.
