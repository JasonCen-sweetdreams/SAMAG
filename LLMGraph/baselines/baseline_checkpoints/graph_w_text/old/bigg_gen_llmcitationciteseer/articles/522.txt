In distributed manufacturing, efficient task allocation among agents is crucial to optimize production workflows. This paper presents a novel framework for coordinating multi-agent systems, leveraging a hybrid approach that combines decentralized planning with centralized coordination. Our method, called 'Distributed Task Allocation with Negotiation' (DTAN), enables agents to negotiate task assignments based on their capabilities, availability, and preferences. We evaluate DTAN through simulations and experiments on a real-world manufacturing dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time, resource utilization, and overall system efficiency.
