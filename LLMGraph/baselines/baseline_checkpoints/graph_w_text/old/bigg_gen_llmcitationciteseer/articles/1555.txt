This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) and its impact on user experience. We design and evaluate a gesture-based interaction system that leverages the human body's sensory and motor capabilities to enhance user engagement and presence in VR environments. Our study involves 30 participants who performed a series of tasks in both gesture-based and controller-based VR settings. Results show significant improvements in user satisfaction, task completion time, and cognitive load reduction in the gesture-based condition. Our findings have implications for the design of immersive and intuitive VR interfaces that seamlessly integrate human physicality and cognition.
