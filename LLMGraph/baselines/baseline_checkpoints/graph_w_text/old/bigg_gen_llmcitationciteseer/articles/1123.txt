Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide transparency and accountability in decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for ERS, which captures complex user-item relationships and generates interpretable explanations. Our approach utilizes a two-stage attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant user and item features, resulting in improved recommendation accuracy and explainability. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN-ERS in generating accurate and interpretable recommendations.
