Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with visual impairments often face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces that cater to users with visual impairments. We conducted an in-depth user study to identify the unique needs and challenges of this population, and developed a set of design guidelines that prioritize accessibility, usability, and user experience. Our proposed framework incorporates multimodal feedback, auditory cues, and haptic feedback to enable users with visual impairments to navigate and interact with VR environments more effectively.
