The proliferation of large-scale datasets has rendered traditional query expansion techniques inefficient. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, dubbed 'HyQE', which leverages a tree-based indexing structure to prune irrelevant terms and focus on informative query components. HyQE adaptively adjusts the expansion depth based on query complexity and dataset characteristics, achieving significant reductions in retrieval time while maintaining retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of HyQE over state-of-the-art methods, particularly for long-tail queries.
