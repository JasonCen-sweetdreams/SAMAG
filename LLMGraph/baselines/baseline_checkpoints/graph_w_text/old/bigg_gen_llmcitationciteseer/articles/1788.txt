Gesture-based interfaces in virtual reality (VR) often rely on visual feedback to guide user movements. However, fixed feedback designs may not accommodate individual differences in motor skills, leading to frustration and decreased performance. This paper presents an adaptive visual feedback system, 'Virtuoso', that dynamically adjusts feedback cues based on user proficiency and movement patterns. Our user study with 24 participants showed that Virtuoso significantly improved gesture recognition accuracy and reduced movement time compared to traditional fixed-feedback designs. We discuss implications for inclusive VR design and future directions for adaptive feedback in HCI.
