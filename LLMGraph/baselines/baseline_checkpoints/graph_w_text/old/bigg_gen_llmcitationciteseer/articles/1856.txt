Real-time information retrieval (IR) systems require efficient document filtering to retrieve relevant documents quickly. We propose a novel neural ranking model, 'NeuFilter', that leverages BERT-based embeddings to learn semantic representations of documents and queries. NeuFilter uses a combination of keyword extraction and semantic matching to filter out irrelevant documents, reducing the candidate set for ranking. Experimental results on the TREC News Track dataset show that NeuFilter achieves a 30% reduction in filtering time while maintaining a 10% improvement in mean average precision compared to state-of-the-art ranking models.
