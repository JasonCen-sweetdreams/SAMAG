Time-series forecasting models often lack interpretability, hindering their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that generates explainable forecasts for multivariate time-series data. Our HAN model comprises two attention mechanisms: a feature-level attention module that selects relevant input features and a temporal attention module that identifies influential time segments. We evaluate our approach on three real-world datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and explainability over state-of-the-art baselines.
