Temporal graph analysis has gained significant attention in recent years, with applications in social network analysis, recommender systems, and cybersecurity. However, indexing temporal graphs poses unique challenges due to their massive scale and temporal complexities. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'HiBGF', which leverages hierarchical Bloom filters to efficiently store and query temporal graphs. Our approach exploits the temporal locality of graph updates to minimize filter false positives, reducing query latency by up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods. Experimental results on real-world temporal graph datasets demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of HiBGF.
