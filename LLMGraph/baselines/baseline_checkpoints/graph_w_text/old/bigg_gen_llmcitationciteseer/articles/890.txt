Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular in today's big data era. However, optimizing queries in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution in DDS. We design a RL agent that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the system's current state and query workload. Our experiments on a real-world DDS setup show that the proposed approach reduces query execution time by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques. We also demonstrate the scalability and adaptability of our approach in handling varying query workloads and system configurations.
