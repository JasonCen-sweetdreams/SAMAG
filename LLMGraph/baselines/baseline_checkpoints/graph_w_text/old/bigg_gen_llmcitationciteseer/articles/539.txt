Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and facial expressions, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of each modality to improve emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers that extract relevant features and a hierarchical fusion layer that integrates the features from each modality. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal data, especially in scenarios with noisy or missing data.
