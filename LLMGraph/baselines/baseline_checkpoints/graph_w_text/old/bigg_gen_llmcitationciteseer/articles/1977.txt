Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper introduces Hierarchical Attention Networks for Anomaly Detection (HANAD), a novel architecture that integrates hierarchical attention mechanisms with autoencoders to detect anomalies while providing explainable insights. HANAD captures multi-scale contextual information and adaptively weighs the importance of different time-stamps and features. Experimental results on real-world time-series datasets demonstrate that HANAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of anomaly detection accuracy and explanation quality.
