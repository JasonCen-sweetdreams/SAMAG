Real-time data warehousing demands efficient query processing to support timely business decision-making. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, Hierarchical Join Indices (HJI), to accelerate query performance in data warehousing environments. HJI leverages hierarchical clustering to group related join attributes, reducing the number of join operations and minimizing index maintenance overhead. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that HJI outperforms traditional indexing methods, achieving an average query speedup of 3.2x and reducing index creation time by 45%.
