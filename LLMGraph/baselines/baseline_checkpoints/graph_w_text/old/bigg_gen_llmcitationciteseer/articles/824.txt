Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework for explainable time series anomaly detection. Our approach combines a self-attention mechanism with a hierarchical clustering module to identify complex patterns and highlight the most informative segments contributing to anomalies. We evaluate HAN on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and improved interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
