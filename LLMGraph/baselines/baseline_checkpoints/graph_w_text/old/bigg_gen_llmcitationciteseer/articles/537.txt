Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it helps to refine the search query and improve the relevance of retrieved documents. However, traditional QE methods rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages neural networks to learn query representations and generate expanded queries. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Furthermore, we show that DeepQE can be seamlessly integrated with existing IR systems, making it a promising solution for real-world search applications.
