Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis is a complex task that relies on behavioral observations and clinical assessments. Recent studies have explored the potential of machine learning models in aiding ASD diagnosis, but their black-box nature hinders trust and interpretability. This paper proposes an attention-based explainable neural network (AXNN) framework that leverages multi-modal data (behavioral, genetic, and neuroimaging) to predict ASD diagnosis. Our AXNN model incorporates attention mechanisms to identify salient features contributing to the diagnosis, providing interpretable explanations for clinicians. Experimental results on a large ASD dataset demonstrate the superiority of AXNN over state-of-the-art models in terms of both accuracy and explainability.
