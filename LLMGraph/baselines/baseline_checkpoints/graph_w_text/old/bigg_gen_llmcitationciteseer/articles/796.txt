Time series anomaly detection is a critical task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, their lack of interpretability hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time series anomaly detection. Our HAN architecture leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture complex temporal dependencies and identify anomalous patterns. We introduce a novel attention-based explanation method, enabling the identification of contributing factors to anomaly detection. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies while providing interpretable insights.
