In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework, 'GraphAgent', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn distributed representations of agents and tasks. Our approach enables agents to communicate and negotiate task assignments in a decentralized manner, without relying on a central controller. Experimental results on a simulated robotics environment demonstrate that GraphAgent outperforms traditional task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
