Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in DDS due to the complexities of distributed query planning and execution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design a RL framework that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the DDS environment and receiving rewards based on query performance. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
