Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages deep semantic embeddings to better capture the semantic relationships between query terms. Our approach, termed 'SemExpan', employs a pre-trained language model to generate dense vector representations of query terms, which are then used to expand the original query through a weighted graph-based method. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
