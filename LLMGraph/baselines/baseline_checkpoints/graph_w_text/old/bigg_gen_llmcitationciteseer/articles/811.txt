Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc search tasks, but their computational cost hinders real-time deployment. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages the strengths of both sparse and dense retrieval models. HQE adaptively selects a subset of queries to expand based on their semantic importance, and then applies a neural re-ranker to refine the results. Our experiments on the TREC CORE dataset demonstrate that HQE achieves a 30% reduction in computational cost while maintaining a 5% improvement in search accuracy compared to existing neural retrieval methods.
