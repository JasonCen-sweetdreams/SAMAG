Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their performance in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical adversarial training framework, 'HAT', which leverages a multi-level attack strategy to improve the robustness of deep models. We demonstrate that HAT can effectively defend against both white-box and black-box attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art adversarial training methods. Our approach is scalable, efficient, and can be easily integrated into existing deep learning pipelines, making it a promising solution for real-world AI applications.
