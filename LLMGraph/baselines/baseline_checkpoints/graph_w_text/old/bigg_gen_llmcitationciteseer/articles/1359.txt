Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires effective query expansion to retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep contextualized embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and document keywords. Our method, called Embedding-based Query Expansion (EMQE), integrates BERT-derived embeddings with a graph-based ranking algorithm to generate a weighted set of expansion terms. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that EMQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval quality and downstream answer accuracy.
