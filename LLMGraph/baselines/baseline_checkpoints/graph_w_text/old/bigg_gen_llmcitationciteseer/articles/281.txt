Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper introduces 'HATNet', a hierarchical attention network that leverages both local and global patterns to detect anomalies in time-series data. We propose a novel attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant regions of the input data, enabling the model to provide transparent and explainable results. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that HATNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and speed.
