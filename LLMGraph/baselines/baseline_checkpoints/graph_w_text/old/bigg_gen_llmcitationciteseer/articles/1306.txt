The use of virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular in various domains, including education, entertainment, and healthcare. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge in VR systems. This paper presents a study on the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR environments. We designed and implemented a VR system that generates personalized avatars based on users' physical characteristics and preferences. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, as measured by their time spent in the VR environment, compared to those who interacted with generic avatars. We also found that personalized avatars led to increased user satisfaction and a stronger sense of presence in the VR environment.
