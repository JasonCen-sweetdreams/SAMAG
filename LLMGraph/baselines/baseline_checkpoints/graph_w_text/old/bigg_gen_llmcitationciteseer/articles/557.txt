Older adults with cognitive impairments face significant barriers when interacting with digital systems. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interface design framework, 'EasyGest', tailored to accommodate the cognitive and motor abilities of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying key design considerations and gesture patterns that facilitate intuitive interaction. EasyGest incorporates personalized gesture recognition, adaptive feedback, and error correction mechanisms, demonstrating a significant reduction in interaction time and error rates compared to existing interfaces.
