Cooperative task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must collaborate to accomplish complex tasks in dynamic environments. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'CATARINA', which enables agents to learn cooperative strategies for task allocation in real-time. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and incorporates a entropy-based exploration strategy to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that CATARINA outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
