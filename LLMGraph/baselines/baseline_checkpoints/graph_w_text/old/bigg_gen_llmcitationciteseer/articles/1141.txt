Knowledge graphs have become essential for various applications, but their construction is often hindered by entity resolution, which involves identifying and merging duplicate entities across data sources. This paper presents GraphER, a novel graph-based entity resolution approach that leverages both structural and semantic features of entities to improve scalability and accuracy. We propose a hierarchical clustering algorithm that groups similar entities based on their neighborhood structures and then applies a supervised learning model to disambiguate entities within each cluster. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that GraphER outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 30% in terms of precision and recall while reducing computational overhead by an order of magnitude.
