This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for autonomous agents using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'AgentDRL', that enables agents to learn optimal task assignment strategies through interactions with their environment and other agents. Our approach leverages a multi-agent deep Q-network to model complex task dependencies and agent capabilities, and incorporates a consensus-based protocol to ensure distributed decision-making. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that AgentDRL outperforms traditional allocation methods in terms of task completion rates and resource utilization.
