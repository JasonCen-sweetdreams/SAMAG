Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a crucial area of research, with applications in domains like autonomous vehicles and smart grids. However, the lack of interpretability in MARL models hinders their deployment in real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel architecture, Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), which combines graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical clustering to learn explainable policy representations in MARL settings. HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several cooperative and competitive MARL benchmarks, while providing insights into the decision-making process of individual agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in a real-world autonomous driving scenario, illustrating its potential for real-world impact.
