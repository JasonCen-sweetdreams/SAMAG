Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph structures and the need to balance query latency with resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database. We introduce a graph-aware reinforcement learning framework, 'GraQL', that integrates with existing query optimizers to reduce query latency by up to 40% and improve resource utilization by up to 30%. Experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraQL in optimizing complex queries.
