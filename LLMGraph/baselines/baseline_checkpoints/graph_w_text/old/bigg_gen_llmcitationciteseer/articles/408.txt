Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed databases. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
