Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query processing in DDS remains a performance bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GPU-Index', that leverages Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate indexing in DDS. By offloading indexing tasks to GPUs, we demonstrate significant performance improvements in query processing, with an average speedup of 3.5x compared to traditional CPU-based indexing. We also develop an adaptive indexing strategy that dynamically adjusts the index structure based on query patterns and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that GPU-Index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques in DDS.
