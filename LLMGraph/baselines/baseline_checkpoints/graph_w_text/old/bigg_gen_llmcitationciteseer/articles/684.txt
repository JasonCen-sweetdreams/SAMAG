Emotion recognition from multimodal data, such as speech, text, and vision, remains a challenging task due to the complexities of human emotions and the heterogeneity of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and time steps to improve emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention modules and a hierarchical fusion mechanism, which captures both local and global relationships across modalities. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multimodal data.
