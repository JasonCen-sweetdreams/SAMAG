Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, where the goal is to reformulate the user's query to better capture their information need. While traditional methods rely on statistical term dependencies, they often fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a graph-based approach to query expansion, where term relationships are modeled as a heterogeneous graph and leveraged to generate expanded queries. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries with ambiguous or implicit intent. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the graph structure's impact on query expansion quality.
