Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) for improving the retrieval performance. However, existing methods often rely on term co-occurrence or frequency-based approaches, which may not capture the semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding approach, 'Graph-EmbEx', which represents queries and documents as nodes in a graph and leverages graph convolutional networks to learn dense vector representations. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Graph-EmbEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
