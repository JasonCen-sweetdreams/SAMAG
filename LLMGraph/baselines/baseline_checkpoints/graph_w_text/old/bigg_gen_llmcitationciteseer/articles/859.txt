Real-time database systems require efficient concurrency control mechanisms to ensure timely execution of transactions. This paper proposes an adaptive concurrency control algorithm, 'AdaptCC', which dynamically adjusts the level of concurrency based on system workload and transaction characteristics. AdaptCC utilizes a machine learning-based predictor to forecast transaction response times and adjust the concurrency level accordingly. Our experimental evaluation on a real-time database benchmark demonstrates that AdaptCC achieves up to 30% improvement in average response time compared to existing concurrency control algorithms.
