As the global population ages, creating accessible interfaces for older adults with motor impairments becomes increasingly important. This paper presents a novel gestural interface design framework that incorporates insights from gerontology, HCI, and machine learning. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with motor impairments, revealing that our proposed framework improves gesture recognition accuracy by 25% and reduces error rates by 30% compared to existing interfaces. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and supportive gestural interfaces for this underserved population.
