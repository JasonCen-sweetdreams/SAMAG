This paper investigates the design of gesture-based interfaces that cater to older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to identify the physical and cognitive challenges they face when interacting with gesture-based systems. Based on our findings, we developed a set of guidelines for designing inclusive gesture-based interfaces. We then implemented a prototype system that incorporates these guidelines and evaluated its usability with 15 older adults. Our results show that the proposed system significantly improves the interaction experience and reduces error rates compared to traditional gesture-based interfaces.
