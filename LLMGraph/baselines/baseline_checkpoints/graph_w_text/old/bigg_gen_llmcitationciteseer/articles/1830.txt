Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in many households, but their interactions are often designed with younger adults in mind, neglecting the needs of older adults. This study explores the impact of conversational interface design on older adults' user experience. We developed three voice assistant personas with varying levels of anthropomorphism and politeness, and conducted a usability study with 30 older adults. Our results show that participants preferred the more polite and human-like persona, which led to increased user satisfaction and reduced frustration. We provide design recommendations for creating more inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of older adults.
