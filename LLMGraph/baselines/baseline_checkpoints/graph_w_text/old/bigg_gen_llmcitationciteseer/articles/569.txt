Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to enhance the representation of user queries to improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel QE approach that leverages deep learning-based embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'EmbedQE', uses a neural network to learn dense vector representations of query terms and their expansions, which are then used to generate an expanded query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmbedQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
