The proliferation of large-scale document collections necessitates efficient and effective information retrieval techniques. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE', which leverages a combination of semantic and syntactic features to disambiguate query terms and improve retrieval precision. Our method employs a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group related documents and expand the query scope, resulting in a significant reduction in computational overhead compared to traditional query expansion methods. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate the efficacy of HQE in improving mean average precision and reducing query processing time.
