Voice assistants have the potential to enhance the independence and quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing systems often fail to accommodate their unique needs, leading to frustration and abandonment. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CAREVoice', a novel voice assistant framework tailored to the requirements of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a participatory design process with 20 older adults and 10 caregivers to inform the development of CAREVoice, which incorporates personalized prompts, simplified dialogue flows, and caregiver-mediated customization. A usability study with 15 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
