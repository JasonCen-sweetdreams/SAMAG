Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, but existing approaches often lack interpretability. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages both local and global patterns in time series data to generate accurate and explainable forecasts. Our HAN model consists of two stages: a local attention module that captures short-term dependencies and a global attention module that models long-term trends. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
