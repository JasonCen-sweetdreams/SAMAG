This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for autonomous traffic signal control. We model the traffic network as a multi-agent system, where each agent learns to optimize its signal timing policy to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. Our approach utilizes a novel reward function that incorporates real-time traffic metrics and incorporates a curriculum learning strategy to facilitate policy learning. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulation platform demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional fixed-time and adaptive signal control methods, and achieves a 23% reduction in average travel time.
