In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel auction-based mechanism, 'Distributed Auction-based Task Allocation' (DATA), which enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. DATA leverages a decentralized, iterative auction approach to allocate tasks, ensuring that agents optimize their utility while respecting system-wide constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DATA in a realistic simulation environment, showcasing improved task allocation efficiency and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
