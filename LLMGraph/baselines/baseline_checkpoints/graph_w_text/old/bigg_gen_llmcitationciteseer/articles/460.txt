Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, but its adoption is hindered by user experience issues. This study explores the impact of personalized avatars on user engagement, presence, and satisfaction in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR platform using either a generic or personalized avatar. Results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance user experience, with improvements in perceived realism, emotional connection, and overall enjoyment. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems, highlighting the importance of incorporating personalization techniques to increase user adoption and retention.
