In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires coordinating agents to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning framework, 'CATALYST', which learns to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, task priorities, and environmental constraints. Our approach leverages a graph neural network to represent agent-agent and agent-task interactions, and a decentralized actor-critic algorithm to optimize task allocation policies. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that CATALYST outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
