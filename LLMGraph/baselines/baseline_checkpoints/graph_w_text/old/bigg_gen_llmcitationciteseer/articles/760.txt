In complex multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem due to the dynamic nature of tasks and agent capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating heterogeneous agents using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a hierarchical framework that integrates a task allocation module with a deep Q-network, enabling agents to learn optimal task assignments based on their capabilities, task requirements, and environmental constraints. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptation to changing environmental conditions.
