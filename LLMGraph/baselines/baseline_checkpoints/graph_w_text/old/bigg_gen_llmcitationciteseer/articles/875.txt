Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but their effectiveness is often limited by their ability to understand diverse pronunciations and accents. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the impact of pronunciation variability and accent neutrality on voice assistant performance. We collect a large dataset of spoken language samples from diverse populations and develop a novel accent normalization technique that improves speech recognition accuracy by 22.5% for non-native speakers. Our results highlight the importance of inclusive design in voice assistants and provide recommendations for developers to create more accessible interfaces.
