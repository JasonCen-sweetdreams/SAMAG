Virtual reality (VR) has immense potential for immersive experiences, but user satisfaction is heavily influenced by the degree of personalization. This study empirically investigates the effects of personalized VR environments on user engagement, perceived usability, and cognitive load. We developed a novel VR platform that adaptively adjusts visual, auditory, and haptic cues based on individual user preferences. Our findings suggest that personalized VR experiences lead to significant improvements in user satisfaction, reduced cognitive load, and enhanced overall engagement. These results have important implications for the design of VR systems in fields such as education, entertainment, and therapy.
