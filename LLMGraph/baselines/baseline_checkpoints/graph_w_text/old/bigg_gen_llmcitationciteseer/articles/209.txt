Virtual reality (VR) systems often rely on visual feedback to convey gesture recognition results, potentially overwhelming users. This paper explores the use of auditory feedback to enhance gesture recognition in VR. We designed and evaluated an auditory feedback system that utilizes 3D audio cues to convey gesture recognition confidence and type. Our user study with 30 participants shows that our system improves gesture recognition accuracy by 17.5% compared to visual feedback alone, while reducing cognitive load. We discuss the implications of our findings for VR system design and future research directions.
