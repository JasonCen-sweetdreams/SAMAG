Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but seniors often face barriers in using these systems due to cognitive, sensory, and motor impairments. This paper presents a participatory design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the needs of seniors. We conducted co-design workshops with 20 seniors and 10 caregivers to identify design requirements and iteratively refined our system through user testing. Our results show that our approach significantly improves the accessibility and usability of voice assistants for seniors, enabling them to control their smart homes and access essential services with greater ease and confidence.
