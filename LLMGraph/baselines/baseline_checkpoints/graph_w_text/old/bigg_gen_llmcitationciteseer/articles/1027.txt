The increasing prevalence of heterogeneous data sources has made query optimization a complex task. Traditional optimization techniques rely on static cost models, which fail to capture the dynamic behavior of modern data systems. This paper proposes an adaptive learning approach, 'Aurora', which leverages machine learning to optimize query execution on heterogeneous data sources. Aurora uses a multi-armed bandit framework to dynamically select the most efficient query plan based on runtime feedback. We evaluate Aurora on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
