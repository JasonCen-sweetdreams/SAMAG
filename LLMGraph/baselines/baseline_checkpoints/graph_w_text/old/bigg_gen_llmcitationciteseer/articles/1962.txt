Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. Our method, called QOptRL, learns to predict the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. We evaluate QOptRL on a real-world dataset and show that it outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
