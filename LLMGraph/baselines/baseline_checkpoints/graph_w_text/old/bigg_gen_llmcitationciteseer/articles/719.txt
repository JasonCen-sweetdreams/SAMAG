This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles to gesture-based interaction in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed and implemented a VR system that utilizes machine learning-based hand tracking and gesture recognition to enable users to manipulate virtual objects in a natural and intuitive manner. Our user study reveals that the embodied cognition approach significantly enhances user experience, improving task performance and reducing cognitive load. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more immersive and engaging VR interfaces.
