Efficient retrieval of relevant information from semi-structured data sources is a crucial task in many applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchical query expansion (HQE) that leverages the inherent structure of semi-structured data to improve retrieval efficiency. Our method exploits the hierarchical relationships between query terms to generate a more informative and concise query representation. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale dataset of XML documents and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
