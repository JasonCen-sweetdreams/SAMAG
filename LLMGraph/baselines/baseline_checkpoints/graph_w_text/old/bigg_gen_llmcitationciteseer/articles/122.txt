Distributed information retrieval systems face significant challenges in terms of query efficiency and scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical semantic indexing approach, 'HiSense', which leverages graph neural networks to learn semantic representations of documents and queries. By organizing the index into a hierarchical structure, HiSense enables efficient query routing and pruning, reducing the number of nodes involved in query processing. Experimental results on a large-scale web dataset demonstrate that HiSense achieves up to 3x improvement in query response time and 2x reduction in network traffic compared to state-of-the-art distributed IR systems.
