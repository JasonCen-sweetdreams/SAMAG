Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating inclusive VR experiences that cater to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with stakeholders, including caregivers, healthcare professionals, and older adults, to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our design framework incorporates cognitive support mechanisms, such as visual cues, auditory feedback, and simplified interfaces, to facilitate engagement and accessibility. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in user experience and cognitive engagement compared to traditional VR systems.
