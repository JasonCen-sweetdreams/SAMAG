Distributed databases have become a norm in modern data management, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Traditional indexing techniques often fall short in distributed settings due to data skew, node heterogeneity, and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'LearnedIndex', which leverages machine learning to optimize query processing in distributed databases. By learning compact index structures that adapt to data distributions and node capacities, LearnedIndex achieves significant performance improvements over traditional indexing methods. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database show that LearnedIndex reduces query latency by up to 40% and improves throughput by up to 30%.
