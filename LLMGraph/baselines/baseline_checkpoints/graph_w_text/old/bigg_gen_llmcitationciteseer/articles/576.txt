As graph databases continue to scale, optimizing query performance becomes increasingly complex. This paper presents a novel approach to distributed query optimization, leveraging a hierarchical graph partitioning scheme and adaptive query rewriting. Our method, dubbed 'GraphOpt', reduces query latency by up to 50% compared to existing distributed graph database systems. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world social network dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling complex queries with varying graph sizes and query workloads.
