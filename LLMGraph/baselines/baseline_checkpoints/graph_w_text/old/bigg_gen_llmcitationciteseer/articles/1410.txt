Search engines often struggle to provide diverse search results, leading to a poor user experience. This paper proposes a novel context-aware re-ranking framework that incorporates user behavior and query intent to improve search result diversification. Our approach leverages a combination of query and document embeddings, along with a session-based attention mechanism, to capture the nuances of user context. Experimental results on a large-scale search log dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art diversification methods, achieving a 23% increase in result diversity while maintaining a high level of relevance.
