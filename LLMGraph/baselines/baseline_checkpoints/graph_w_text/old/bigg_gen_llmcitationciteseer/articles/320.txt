Autonomous vehicles rely on complex control systems to navigate diverse scenarios. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for efficient autonomous vehicle control. Our approach combines a high-level planning module with a low-level control policy, enabling the agent to adapt to changing environments and optimize fuel efficiency. We introduce a novel reward function that incorporates safety, comfort, and fuel consumption metrics, and demonstrate improved performance and robustness in simulated and real-world experiments.
