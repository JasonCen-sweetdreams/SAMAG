Recent advancements in virtual reality (VR) have enabled immersive experiences, but many users face exclusion due to inaccessible interfaces. This paper presents a novel framework for designing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) that facilitate inclusive VR interactions. We conducted a user study to identify the impact of ECA embodiment, gaze, and gesture cues on user experience and accessibility. Our results show that ECAs with personalized embodiment and adaptive cueing significantly improve user engagement, comfort, and accessibility for users with disabilities. We provide design guidelines for ECA development in VR and discuss future directions for inclusive HCI research.
