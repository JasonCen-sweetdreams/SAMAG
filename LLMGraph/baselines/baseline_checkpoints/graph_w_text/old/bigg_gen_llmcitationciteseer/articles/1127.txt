Few-shot learning with graph-structured data is a challenging problem, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages a hierarchical clustering approach to selectively focus on relevant subgraphs. Our method integrates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to capture both local and global patterns in the graph. We demonstrate the efficacy of HGAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-shot learning tasks while reducing computational complexity by an order of magnitude.
