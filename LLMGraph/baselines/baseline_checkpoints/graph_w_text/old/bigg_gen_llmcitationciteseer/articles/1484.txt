Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it aims to expand the original query to retrieve more relevant documents. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted features and term weighting schemes, which may not capture the complex relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a deep neural network-based approach, 'DeepQE', that learns to expand queries by modeling the semantic relationships between terms. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
