Object detection is a critical task in autonomous vehicle systems, but existing approaches often require large amounts of labeled data and computational resources. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical contrastive learning framework, 'HiCoLD', which leverages self-supervised learning to improve object detection efficiency. By contrasting features at multiple scales and resolutions, HiCoLD learns robust representations that can be fine-tuned for object detection tasks. Our experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that HiCoLD achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing training data and computational requirements by up to 50%.
