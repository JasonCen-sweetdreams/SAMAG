Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities must be assigned to tasks to optimize system performance. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task-agent affinity matrices. Our approach, dubbed 'GNN-Allocator', enables agents to locally compute task assignments based on their partial observations of the environment and communication with neighboring agents. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that GNN-Allocator outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
