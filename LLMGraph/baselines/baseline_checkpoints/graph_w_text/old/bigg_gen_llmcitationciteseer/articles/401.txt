This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, 'Task-MAAC', which enables agents to learn task allocation policies in a decentralized manner, without relying on a central controller. Task-MAAC uses a hierarchical architecture, comprising a high-level task allocator and low-level motion controllers, to efficiently allocate tasks to agents while minimizing collisions and maximizing overall system performance. Experimental results demonstrate that Task-MAAC outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in complex, dynamic environments.
