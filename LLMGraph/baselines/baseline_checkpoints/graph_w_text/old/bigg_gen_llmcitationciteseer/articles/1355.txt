Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessible experiences for users with visual impairments. However, current VR systems often neglect the needs of this user group. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences, focusing on auditory and haptic feedback. We conducted a user study with 20 visually impaired participants, identifying key challenges and opportunities for VR interaction. Our results inform the development of a set of guidelines and tools for creating accessible VR experiences, demonstrating significant improvements in user engagement and task completion rates.
