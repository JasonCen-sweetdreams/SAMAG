Distributed databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep RL algorithm to learn an optimal query plan. Our approach, called 'RL-Opt', leverages the exploration-exploitation trade-off to balance query execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource efficiency.
