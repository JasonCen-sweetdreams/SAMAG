We propose a novel decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Our approach, called MADQN, leverages a decentralized actor-critic architecture to enable agents to learn task assignments and execute them in a distributed manner. We evaluate MADQN on a simulated warehouse management scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to centralized approaches. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that MADQN converges to an optimal task allocation policy, making it a promising solution for real-world applications involving autonomous agents.
