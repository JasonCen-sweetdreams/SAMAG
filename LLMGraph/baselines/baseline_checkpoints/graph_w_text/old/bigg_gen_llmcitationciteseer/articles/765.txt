Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR), particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic query representations. Our method incorporates a relevance-based attention mechanism to weigh term importance and a hierarchical clustering module to generate coherent expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness while maintaining efficiency.
