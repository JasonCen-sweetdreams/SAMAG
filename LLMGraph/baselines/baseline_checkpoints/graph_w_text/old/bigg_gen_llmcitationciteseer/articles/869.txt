Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in modern data management systems, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database's current state and the query's characteristics. Our experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that the DQN-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while also adapting to changing database workloads.
