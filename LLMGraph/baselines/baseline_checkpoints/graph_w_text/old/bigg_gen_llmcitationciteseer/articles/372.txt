As multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, understanding the decision-making processes of individual agents is crucial for trust and reliability. This paper presents a novel hierarchical temporal attention mechanism, 'HTAM', which enables explainable decision making in multi-agent settings. HTAM combines local and global attention to model complex agent interactions, while a hierarchical structure captures temporal dependencies. We demonstrate HTAM's effectiveness in a simulated traffic control scenario, showcasing improved interpretability and decision quality compared to existing approaches.
