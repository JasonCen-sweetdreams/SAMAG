The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms has severe consequences for individuals and society. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for multi-modal fake news detection. Our approach leverages the structural relationships between users, news articles, and their corresponding visual and textual features to identify fake news. We propose a novel attention mechanism that adaptively weighs the importance of different modalities and graph neighbors, enabling the model to capture complex patterns and interactions. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in detecting fake news, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
