Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution plans in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. Our approach, called 'RL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plan based on the system's current workload and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that RL-QO achieves an average of 30% reduction in query execution time compared to traditional optimization techniques.
