Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem, particularly in the presence of varying workload patterns and system dynamics. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the system. Our experiments on a real-world DDS setup show that our RL-based approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
