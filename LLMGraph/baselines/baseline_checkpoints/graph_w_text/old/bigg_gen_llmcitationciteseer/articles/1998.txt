Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their anthropomorphic designs can perpetuate social biases and exclusion. This paper presents a study on user experience with synthetic embodiments in voice assistants, exploring how inclusive design can improve user engagement and perceived trust. We designed and evaluated three voice assistant prototypes with varying levels of synthetic embodiment, and conducted a mixed-methods study with 120 participants. Our results show that users prefer voice assistants with minimal synthetic embodiment, and that inclusive design can increase user satisfaction and reduce biases. We discuss implications for the design of future voice assistants and provide recommendations for practitioners.
