Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in such systems. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for efficient query optimization in distributed databases. We model the query optimization problem as a graph partitioning problem and develop a scalable algorithm that minimizes query execution time. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
