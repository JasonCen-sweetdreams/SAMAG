Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often struggle with limited query context, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. We propose a hierarchical attention-based model that learns to identify relevant terms and phrases in the query context and generates expanded queries accordingly. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries. We also analyze the impact of different neural architectures and training objectives on the query expansion process.
