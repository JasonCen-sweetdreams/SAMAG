This paper presents a decentralized approach to multi-agent cooperative exploration, where agents with heterogeneous sensor suites collaborate to efficiently map and explore unknown environments. We introduce a novel distributed algorithm, 'HeteroExplore', which leverages agent-specific sensor models to adaptively allocate exploration tasks and fuse sensory information. Experimental results in simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate that HeteroExplore outperforms existing methods in terms of exploration efficiency, coverage, and accuracy, while accommodating varying agent capabilities and communication constraints.
