Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies in time-series data while providing explainable results. Our approach combines multi-scale feature extraction with attention mechanisms to identify relevant segments and features contributing to the anomaly. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies and providing insights into the detection process.
