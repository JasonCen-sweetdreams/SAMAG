Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture the nuanced semantics of user queries, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper introduces a novel neural query graph embedding (NQGE) approach to query expansion, which leverages graph neural networks to model complex query relationships. By learning dense vector representations of queries, NQGE enables efficient and effective incorporation of semantic information into the retrieval process. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for verbose and ambiguous queries.
