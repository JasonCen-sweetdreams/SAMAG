Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query performance. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
