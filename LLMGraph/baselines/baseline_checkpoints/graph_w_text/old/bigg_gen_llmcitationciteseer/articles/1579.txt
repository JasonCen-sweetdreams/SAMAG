Conversational agents have shown promise in providing emotional support for individuals with mental health conditions. However, existing systems often lack embodied features, limiting their ability to convey empathy and establish trust. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EmpathBot', an embodied conversational agent that uses nonverbal cues, such as facial expressions and gestures, to provide emotional support. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that EmpathBot increased feelings of comfort and reduced anxiety compared to a text-based interface. Our findings inform the development of more effective, embodied conversational agents for mental health support.
