Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph traversal and data distribution. This paper presents a novel query optimization technique, 'GraphOpt', which leverages both static and dynamic analysis to identify optimal query plans for distributed graph databases. GraphOpt incorporates a novel graph partitioning strategy and a cost-based optimization framework to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
