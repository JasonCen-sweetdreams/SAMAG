Virtual Reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but existing interfaces often rely on manual inputs, limiting immersion. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction system for VR, leveraging deep learning-based eye tracking. Our approach, 'GazeVR', uses a convolutional neural network to predict gaze directions from eye images, achieving high accuracy and low latency. We demonstrate the efficacy of GazeVR in a VR game scenario, showing improved user experience and reduced fatigue. Our system has potential applications in VR training, gaming, and assistive technologies.
