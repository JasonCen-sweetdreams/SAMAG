Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly popular in various applications, but users with motor impairments often struggle to interact with them effectively. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive gesture-based interfaces that cater to users with motor impairments. We conducted a comprehensive user study to identify the challenges faced by users with motor impairments and developed a set of design guidelines to address these challenges. Our proposed framework incorporates machine learning-based gesture recognition and adaptive assistance mechanisms to facilitate more accurate and efficient interactions. We evaluated our framework through a usability study and found significant improvements in interaction accuracy and user satisfaction.
