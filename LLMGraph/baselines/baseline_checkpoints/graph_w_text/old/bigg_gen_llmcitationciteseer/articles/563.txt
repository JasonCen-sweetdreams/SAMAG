Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework, which leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to generate interpretable recommendations. HGAT models user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph, where attention weights are learned to highlight influential items and features. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
