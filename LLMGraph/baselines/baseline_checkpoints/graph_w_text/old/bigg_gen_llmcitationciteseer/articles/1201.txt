Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their complexity can pose significant barriers for older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing accessible conversational interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops and usability studies, resulting in a set of design guidelines and recommendations for simplifying dialogue flows, enhancing visual cues, and incorporating caregiver support. Our findings have important implications for the design of inclusive and supportive conversational systems that can improve the quality of life for older adults.
