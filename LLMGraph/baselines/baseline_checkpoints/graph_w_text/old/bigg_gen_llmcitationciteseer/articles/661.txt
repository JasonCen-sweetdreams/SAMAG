This paper addresses the challenging problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities must cooperate to achieve a common goal. We propose a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn efficient assignment policies. Our approach, called HeteroMAL, uses a novel multi-agent DRL algorithm that incorporates graph attention mechanisms to capture complex agent interactions and task dependencies. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that HeteroMAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
