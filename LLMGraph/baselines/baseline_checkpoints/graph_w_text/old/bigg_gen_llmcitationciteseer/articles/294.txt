In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize task assignments in real-time. Our approach, called 'MARL-TA', uses a decentralized, multi-agent DRL algorithm to learn a policy that adapts to dynamic task requirements and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that MARL-TA outperforms traditional, centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
