 Few-shot learning has become increasingly important in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, where large annotated datasets are scarce. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach, 'MetaNLP', which leverages episodic training to learn task-agnostic representations. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively selects relevant context tokens, enabling the model to generalize to unseen tasks with limited labeled data. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that MetaNLP outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods in text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering tasks.
