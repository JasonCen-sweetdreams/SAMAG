Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their accessibility limitations hinder users with disabilities from fully benefiting from these technologies. This paper presents an investigation into the design of inclusive voice assistants that incorporate gestural interaction modalities. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 users with disabilities, resulting in the development of a gestural vocabulary for voice assistant commands. We evaluated our proposed system through a usability study, demonstrating improved accessibility and user satisfaction. Our findings contribute to the development of more inclusive human-computer interaction systems.
