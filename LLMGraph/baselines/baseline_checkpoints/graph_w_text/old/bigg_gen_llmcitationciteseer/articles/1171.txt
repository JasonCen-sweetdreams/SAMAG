This paper presents the design and evaluation of a novel tangible user interface (TUI) for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Our system, 'TactileBlocks', utilizes tactile feedback and visual cues to facilitate social skills training and emotional regulation. We conducted a user study with 15 children with ASD, demonstrating improved engagement and reduced anxiety levels compared to traditional screen-based interfaces. Our results inform the development of inclusive and accessible HCI systems for individuals with ASD, highlighting the potential of TUIs to support their cognitive and social development.
