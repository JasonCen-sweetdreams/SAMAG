Optimizing query execution in distributed database systems is a complex problem, particularly in the presence of varying workloads and system configurations. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans. Our method, 'RL-Opt', learns to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies based on feedback from the database system. Experimental results on a realistic benchmark dataset demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving up to 30% improvement in query execution time and 25% reduction in resource utilization.
