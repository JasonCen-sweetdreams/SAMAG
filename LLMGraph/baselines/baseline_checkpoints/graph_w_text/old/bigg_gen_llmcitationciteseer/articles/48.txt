Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR interfaces often neglect their unique needs. This paper presents a novel, inclusive VR interface design that incorporates multisensory cues, simplified navigation, and adaptive difficulty levels to accommodate cognitive declines. Our user-centered approach involved co-designing with older adults and caregivers, resulting in a VR system that improves engagement, reduces frustration, and promotes a sense of autonomy. The proposed design guidelines can inform the development of accessible VR experiences for underserved populations.
