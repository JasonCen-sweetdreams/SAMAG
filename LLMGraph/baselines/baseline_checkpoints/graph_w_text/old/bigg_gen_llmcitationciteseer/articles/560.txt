Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans based on the database system's performance metrics, such as execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
