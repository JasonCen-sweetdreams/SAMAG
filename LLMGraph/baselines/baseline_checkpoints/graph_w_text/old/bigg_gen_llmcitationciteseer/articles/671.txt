Time series forecasting models often lack transparency, making it challenging to understand their predictions. This paper introduces HATS, a hierarchical attention network that incorporates explainability into time series forecasting. HATS uses a novel hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant temporal segments and features, providing interpretable insights into its predictions. We evaluate HATS on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance and improved explainability compared to state-of-the-art models. The proposed framework has significant implications for real-world applications, such as energy consumption forecasting and financial market analysis.
