Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their usability for elderly users with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents an inclusive design framework for voice assistants that caters to the needs of this vulnerable population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 elderly participants with cognitive impairments and 10 caregivers, identifying key challenges and design recommendations. Our proposed framework incorporates personalized prompt adaptation, error tolerance, and multimodal feedback to enhance user experience and accessibility. A usability evaluation of our prototype demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
