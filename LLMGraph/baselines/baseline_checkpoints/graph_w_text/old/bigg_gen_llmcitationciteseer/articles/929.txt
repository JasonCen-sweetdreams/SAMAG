Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing insights into the contributing factors. Our model learns to focus on relevant segments and features of the time series, generating attention weights that can be visualized for explainability. We evaluate HAN on various real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance and ability to identify meaningful patterns in anomalies.
