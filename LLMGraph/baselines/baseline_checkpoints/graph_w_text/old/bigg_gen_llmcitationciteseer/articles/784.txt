Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify the key challenges faced by visually impaired users in VR and developed a set of design guidelines to address these challenges. Our approach incorporates multimodal feedback, audio-based navigation, and personalized accessibility features. A prototype implementation of our framework demonstrates improved user experience and accessibility for visually impaired users.
