Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select efficient query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution times. Our experiments on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, reducing average query latency by up to 30%.
