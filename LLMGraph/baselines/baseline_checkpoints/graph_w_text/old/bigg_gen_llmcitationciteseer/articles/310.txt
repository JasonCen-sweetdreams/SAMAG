This paper addresses the task allocation problem in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and constraints need to be assigned tasks to achieve a global objective. We propose a decentralized approach that leverages graph neural networks to learn a task allocation policy. Our method, called GNN-TA, uses a graph-based representation of the agent-task network and employs a distributed consensus protocol to ensure coordination among agents. Experimental results on a simulated scenario demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency.
