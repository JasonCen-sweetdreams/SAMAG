Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but older adults often face barriers in using these systems effectively. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a series of interviews and usability studies to identify key challenges and preferences of older adults when interacting with voice assistants. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant system, 'EchoAge', which incorporates features such as slow speech processing, acoustic adaptation, and multimodal feedback. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to commercial voice assistants.
