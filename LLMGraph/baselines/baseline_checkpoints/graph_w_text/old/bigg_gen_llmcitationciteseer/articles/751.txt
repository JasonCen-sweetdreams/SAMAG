Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their effectiveness is often hindered by the lack of personalized understanding of user preferences. We propose a novel approach, 'ConversePref', which leverages conversational probing to elicit users' preferences in real-time. Our method employs a probabilistic topic model to analyze user responses and adapt the assistant's behavior accordingly. We conducted a user study with 100 participants, demonstrating that ConversePref significantly improves user satisfaction and reduces frustration compared to traditional voice assistants. Our findings have implications for the design of more user-centered and adaptive interfaces.
