In decentralized multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies for heterogeneous agents. We introduce a new GNN architecture that incorporates agent-specific features, communication constraints, and task dependencies to predict optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing decentralized allocation methods, particularly in scenarios with high agent heterogeneity and dynamic task requirements.
