This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for efficient task allocation in multi-agent systems. We propose a two-level hierarchy, where high-level agents learn to allocate tasks to low-level agents based on their capabilities and availability. The low-level agents then learn to execute tasks using a decentralized Q-learning approach. We evaluate our framework in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches. Our results have implications for the development of autonomous systems in real-world applications.
