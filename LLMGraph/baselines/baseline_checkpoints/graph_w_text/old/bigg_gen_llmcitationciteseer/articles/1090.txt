Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) are crucial for building trust in AI-driven decision-making. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) for ERS, which incorporates both user-item interactions and item attributes. HGAT employs a hierarchical graph structure to model complex relationships between users, items, and attributes, and utilizes attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
