Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs, such as facial expressions, speech, and text, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of individual responses. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of different modalities to recognize emotions more accurately. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention modules that extract relevant features, followed by a fusion layer that integrates the output from each modality. We evaluate our approach on the IEMOCAP and SEMAINE datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of emotion recognition accuracy and F1-score.
