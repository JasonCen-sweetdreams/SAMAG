This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents possess diverse capabilities and communicate over a dynamic graph topology. We propose to leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a distributed task allocation policy, allowing agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and team compositions. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized algorithms in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to unexpected agent failures.
