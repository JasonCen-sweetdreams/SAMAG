Query optimization is a crucial component of database systems, but traditional optimization techniques often struggle with complex queries and large datasets. This paper introduces 'LIX', a novel learned index structure that accelerates query optimization by leveraging machine learning models to predict optimal query plans. Our approach integrates a graph neural network with a cost-based optimizer to prune the search space and identify efficient query plans. Experimental results on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate that LIX reduces query optimization time by up to 70% while maintaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art optimizers.
