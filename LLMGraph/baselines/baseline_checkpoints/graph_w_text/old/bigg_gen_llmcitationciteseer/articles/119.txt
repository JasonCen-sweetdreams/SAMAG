Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it can significantly improve the recall of relevant documents. However, existing query expansion techniques often rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to unstructured data. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach to query expansion, which leverages a neural network to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. Our model, called QE-Net, incorporates a novel attention mechanism to selectively expand queries based on their relevance to the top-ranked documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QE-Net outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency.
