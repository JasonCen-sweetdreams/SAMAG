Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling massive amounts of data. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to optimize query plans based on the system's workload and resource utilization. Our proposed approach, 'RL-Opt', outperforms traditional optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and resource efficiency. We evaluate RL-Opt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving query performance in distributed database systems.
