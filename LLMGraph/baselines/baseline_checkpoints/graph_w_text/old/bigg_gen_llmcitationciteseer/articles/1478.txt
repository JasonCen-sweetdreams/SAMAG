As multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, understanding the decision-making processes of individual agents is crucial. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent settings. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to explicitly model agent-agent interactions and selectively focus on relevant contextual information. We evaluate our method on a simulated traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved decision-making accuracy and interpretability compared to baseline models. Our results have implications for the development of more transparent and trustworthy multi-agent systems.
