Time-series data is increasingly prevalent in various domains, including finance, IoT, and healthcare. Main-memory database systems (MMDBs) offer high performance for querying such data, but indexing techniques are still in their infancy. This paper presents a novel indexing scheme, called 'TS-Index', which leverages the inherent temporal locality in time-series data. TS-Index combines a compact in-memory representation with a hierarchical indexing structure, enabling fast query processing and efficient data ingestion. Experimental results on a real-world financial dataset demonstrate that TS-Index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques in MMDBs, achieving up to 5x improvement in query performance and 3x reduction in memory consumption.
