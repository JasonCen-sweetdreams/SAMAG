Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it significantly impacts query performance and system throughput. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called Quro, learns to optimize queries based on feedback from the database system, without requiring explicit modeling of the underlying system dynamics. We evaluate Quro on a real-world distributed database system and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
