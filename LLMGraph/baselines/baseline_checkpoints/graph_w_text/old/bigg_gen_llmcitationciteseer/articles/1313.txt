As robots become increasingly integrated into human-centric workspaces, understanding the impact of embodiment on human-robot collaboration is crucial. This study investigates how varying degrees of embodiment, from abstract avatars to anthropomorphic robots, influence human trust, workload, and task performance in shared workspaces. Our results show that moderate levels of embodiment, incorporating both visual and haptic cues, lead to improved collaboration outcomes compared to fully abstract or highly anthropomorphic designs. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of future human-robot collaboration systems.
