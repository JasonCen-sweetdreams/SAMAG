The proliferation of multi-modal data sources has created new challenges for query optimization in database systems. Existing solutions often rely on heuristics or expensive optimization techniques, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper presents 'MMO', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and constraint-based optimization to efficiently optimize queries for multi-modal databases. MMO outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time, while providing a 2x improvement in plan quality. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MMO in various application domains.
