Multi-tenancy has become a widespread architecture in modern cloud databases, where multiple clients share the same database instance. However, this setup introduces significant query optimization challenges due to the varying workload characteristics of each tenant. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'TenantAware', which leverages machine learning-based workload classification and adaptive indexing to minimize query latency and improve resource utilization. Our extensive experimental evaluation on a real-world cloud database platform demonstrates that TenantAware outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 40% in terms of query response time and 25% in terms of resource consumption.
