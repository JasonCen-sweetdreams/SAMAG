Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in enhancing learning outcomes, but the role of embodied cognition in VR-based education remains understudied. This paper investigates the impact of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load, engagement, and knowledge retention in a VR-based learning environment. We designed a gesture-recognition system that captures users' motor responses to virtual stimuli and analyzed the effects on learning outcomes. Our results indicate that embodied interaction significantly reduces cognitive load, increases engagement, and improves knowledge retention compared to traditional keyboard-and-mouse interfaces. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of designing more effective VR-based educational experiences.
