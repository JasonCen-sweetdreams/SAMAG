Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as facial expressions, speech, and text, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of each modality to recognize emotions more accurately. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers that learn to weigh the importance of each feature, followed by a hierarchical fusion layer that combines the output of each modality. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 0.85 across six emotions.
