Time series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the root cause of anomalies. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explainable results. HAN leverages multi-scale attention mechanisms to identify relevant features and time segments contributing to the anomaly. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and F1-score, while offering meaningful explanations for the detected anomalies.
