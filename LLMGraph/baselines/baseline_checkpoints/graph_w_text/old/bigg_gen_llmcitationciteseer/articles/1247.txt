The increasing scale and complexity of distributed database systems (DDS) pose significant challenges to query performance optimization. Traditional indexing techniques often fall short in DDS due to the dynamic nature of data distribution and query patterns. This paper explores the application of machine learning (ML) to index selection in DDS. We propose a novel framework, 'ML-Index', that leverages query workload patterns and data distributions to predict optimal index configurations. Experimental results on a real-world DDS deployment demonstrate that ML-Index achieves up to 30% improvement in query response time compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
