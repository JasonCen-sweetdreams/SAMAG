Column-oriented databases are increasingly popular in data warehousing and big data analytics, but their performance is often hindered by inefficient indexing methods for multi-dimensional range queries. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'CQR-Tree', which leverages a combination of clustering and space-filling curves to accelerate query processing. We theoretically analyze the query performance and experimentally evaluate CQR-Tree on a real-world dataset, demonstrating significant speedups compared to existing indexing methods.
