This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using graph-based reinforcement learning. We model the task allocation problem as a decentralized Markov decision process and propose a novel graph-based Q-network architecture that enables agents to learn coordinated task allocation policies. Our approach leverages the graph structure of the agent network to facilitate communication and cooperation among agents, resulting in improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios, including robotic warehouse management and smart traffic control.
