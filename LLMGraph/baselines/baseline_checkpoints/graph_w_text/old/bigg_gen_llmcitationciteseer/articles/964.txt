Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in solving complex problems, but its lack of interpretability hinders trust and deployment. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for MARL, which integrates attention mechanisms at both the local and global levels. HAN enables agents to selectively focus on relevant teammates and tasks, leading to improved coordination and overall performance. We introduce a novel explanation module that visualizes attention weights, providing insights into the decision-making process. Experiments on a suite of MARL benchmarks demonstrate HAN's superior performance and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
