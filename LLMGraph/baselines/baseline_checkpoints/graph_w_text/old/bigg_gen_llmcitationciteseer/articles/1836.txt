Explainable AI-driven recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing methods often rely on shallow modeling of user-item interactions, neglecting the rich structural information encoded in graph-structured data. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework that leverages hierarchical graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between users, items, and their attributes. HGAT learns to identify influential factors driving user preferences, enabling accurate and interpretable recommendations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential for real-world deployment.
