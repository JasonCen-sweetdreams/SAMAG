Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR interfaces often exclude this population due to their complexity and lack of accessibility features. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing inclusive VR interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with caregivers and older adults to identify key design principles and developed a prototype VR system that incorporates these principles. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing VR systems.
