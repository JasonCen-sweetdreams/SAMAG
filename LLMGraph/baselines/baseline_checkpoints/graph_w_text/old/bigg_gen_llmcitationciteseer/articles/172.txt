This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing real-time traffic flow using a decentralized multi-agent system. We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework, 'TrafficFlow-RL', which enables individual agents to learn and adapt to changing traffic conditions. Each agent, representing a traffic signal or intersection, can coordinate with its neighbors to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model complex traffic dependencies and explores the use of attention mechanisms to prioritize critical intersections. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate significant improvements in traffic flow efficiency compared to traditional optimization methods.
