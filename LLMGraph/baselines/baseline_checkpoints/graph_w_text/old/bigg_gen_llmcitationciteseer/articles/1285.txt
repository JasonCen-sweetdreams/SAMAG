Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, self-presence, and enjoyment, while reducing cybersickness. We also identify key factors influencing avatar personalization, including facial recognition, body type, and clothing style.
