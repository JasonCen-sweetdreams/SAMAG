Real-time traffic prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in this domain, but their computational complexity hinders their deployment in large-scale, real-time settings. This paper presents 'GraphStorm', a novel, scalable GNN architecture that leverages parallel processing and hierarchical graph decomposition to achieve real-time traffic prediction. We evaluate GraphStorm on a large-scale traffic dataset and demonstrate its ability to predict traffic patterns with high accuracy while reducing computational overhead by up to 75% compared to existing GNN-based methods.
