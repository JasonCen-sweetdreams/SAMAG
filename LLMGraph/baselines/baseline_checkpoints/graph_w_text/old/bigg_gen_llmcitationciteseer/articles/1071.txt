Ad-hoc search engines often struggle to retrieve relevant documents due to the ambiguity of user queries. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, which leverages semantic role labeling and entity disambiguation to enrich the document representation. Our method, dubbed 'QRDX', first identifies the most informative query terms and then expands the document content with relevant entities and concepts. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc search collection demonstrate that QRDX significantly improves the retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
