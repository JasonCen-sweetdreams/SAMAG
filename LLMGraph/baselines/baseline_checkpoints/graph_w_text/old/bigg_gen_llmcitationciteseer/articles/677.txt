Multi-agent planning under uncertainty is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task network (HTN) framework that enables agents to reason about complex tasks and adapt to uncertain environments. Our approach represents tasks as a hierarchical decomposition of subtasks, allowing agents to focus on the most critical aspects of the problem. We introduce a probabilistic planning algorithm that leverages the HTN structure to efficiently search for feasible plans. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue domain demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of plan quality and robustness to uncertainty.
