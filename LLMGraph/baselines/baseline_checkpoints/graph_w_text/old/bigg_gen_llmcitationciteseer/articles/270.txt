In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation, where autonomous agents learn to negotiate and allocate tasks using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our method, called AgentGNN, utilizes a graph-based representation of the agent-agent and agent-task relationships to learn a policy for task allocation. Experimental results on a variety of task scenarios demonstrate that AgentGNN outperforms traditional approaches in terms of task completion rate and agent utilization, while maintaining scalability and robustness to changes in the agent network.
