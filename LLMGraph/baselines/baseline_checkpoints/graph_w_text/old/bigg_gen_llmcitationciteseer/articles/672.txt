In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task allocation policies in a decentralized manner. We model the agent interactions as a graph and utilize GNNs to learn a distributed task allocation algorithm that can adapt to changes in the environment and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated search and rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
