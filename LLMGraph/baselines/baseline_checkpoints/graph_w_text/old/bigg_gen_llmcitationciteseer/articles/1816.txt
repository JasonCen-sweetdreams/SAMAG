Distributed database systems are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our algorithm, QERL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal execution plan for a given query based on the system's current state and query workload. We evaluate QERL on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
