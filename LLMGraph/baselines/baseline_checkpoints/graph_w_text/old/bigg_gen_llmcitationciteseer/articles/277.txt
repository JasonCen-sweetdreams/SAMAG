Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture the nuances of user queries, resulting in suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages deep neural networks to generate context-aware query representations. Our approach, dubbed 'NeuroXPand', employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively incorporate relevant terms from the top-retrieved documents, thereby enhancing the semantic richness of the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroXPand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 22.5% in terms of mean average precision.
