In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our approach, called HRL-TA, enables agents to learn optimal task allocation policies in a distributed manner, without relying on a centralized controller. We employ a novel, hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture that allows agents to adapt to dynamic task requirements and changes in the environment. Experimental results on a simulated multi-robot system demonstrate that HRL-TA outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency and system adaptability.
