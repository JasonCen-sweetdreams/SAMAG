This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural re-ranking model for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of document ranking in information retrieval systems. Our approach combines the strengths of neural ranking models and traditional ranking functions to produce a robust and efficient ranking framework. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ranking performance and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
