Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence, particularly in domains with complex interaction structures. We propose a novel approach that leverages hierarchical graph attention networks (HGATs) to learn effective coordination strategies. Our method represents the agent interaction graph as a hierarchical structure, allowing the HGAT to capture both local and global dependencies. Experimental results on several benchmark domains demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of coordination efficiency and scalability.
