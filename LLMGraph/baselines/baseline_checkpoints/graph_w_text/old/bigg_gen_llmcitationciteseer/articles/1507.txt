This paper presents an adaptive gesture recognition system designed to accommodate elderly users with motor impairments. We propose a novel machine learning framework that incorporates user-centric features, such as gesture velocity and acceleration, to improve recognition accuracy. Our system utilizes a wearable sensor-based interface and a personalized calibration process to adapt to individual users' motor abilities. Experimental results with 20 elderly participants demonstrate a significant reduction in recognition errors compared to traditional gesture recognition systems, highlighting the potential of our approach to enhance the accessibility of gesture-based interfaces for older adults with motor impairments.
