Optimizing query execution plans is crucial for distributed database systems, but existing methods often rely on manual tuning or rule-based approaches. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework, 'QueryOpt', which learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system. We design a reward function that balances query latency, resource utilization, and data freshness, and demonstrate that QueryOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques on a range of synthetic and real-world workloads. Our results show that RL-based query optimization can improve overall system throughput by up to 30% while reducing query latency by up to 25%
