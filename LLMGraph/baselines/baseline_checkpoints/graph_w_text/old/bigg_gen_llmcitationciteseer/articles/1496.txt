Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems is a complex task due to the inherent complexity of graph data and the distributed nature of the system. This paper proposes a novel approach to scalable query optimization using machine learning. We develop a graph neural network-based model that learns to predict the optimal query plan for a given query, taking into account the graph structure, data distribution, and system workload. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world graph dataset demonstrates significant improvements in query performance and scalability compared to existing optimization techniques.
