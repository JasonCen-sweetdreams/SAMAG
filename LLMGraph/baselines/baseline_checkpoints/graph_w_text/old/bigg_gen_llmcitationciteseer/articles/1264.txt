Virtual reality (VR) has increasingly become a popular platform for social interactions, entertainment, and education. This study investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user engagement in VR environments. We designed a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and willingness to return to the VR environment. We also found that users with high levels of self-identity in their avatars reported increased feelings of social connection with other users. These findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to foster social interactions and user engagement.
