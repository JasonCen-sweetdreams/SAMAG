This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging stochastic optimization techniques. Our approach, dubbed 'DecoTA', enables agents to dynamically allocate tasks based on their individual capabilities and environmental uncertainty. We formulate the task allocation problem as a stochastic optimization problem and propose a distributed solution using approximate dynamic programming. Simulation results demonstrate that DecoTA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency, particularly in scenarios with high uncertainty and dynamic task arrivals.
