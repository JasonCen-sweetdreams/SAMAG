Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. Our approach, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plan based on the system's workload and available resources. Experimental results show that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
