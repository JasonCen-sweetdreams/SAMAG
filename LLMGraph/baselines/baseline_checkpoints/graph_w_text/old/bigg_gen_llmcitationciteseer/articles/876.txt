Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query plans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, called QORL, learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment and receiving feedback in the form of execution times. We evaluate QORL on a real-world DDS and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution times compared to traditional optimization techniques.
