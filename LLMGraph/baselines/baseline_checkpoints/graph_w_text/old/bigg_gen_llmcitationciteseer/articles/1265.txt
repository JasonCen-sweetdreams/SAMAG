Optimizing queries in distributed database systems is crucial for improving performance and reducing latency. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query plans. Our RL-based optimizer, 'DQROpt', learns to select the most efficient query plan by interacting with the database environment and receiving rewards based on execution time. We evaluate DQROpt on a real-world dataset and show that it outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time. Additionally, we propose a novel exploration strategy that adapts to the dynamic database workload, further improving the optimizer's performance.
