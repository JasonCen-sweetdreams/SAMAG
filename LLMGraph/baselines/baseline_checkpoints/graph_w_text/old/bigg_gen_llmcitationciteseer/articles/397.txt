Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, but its vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant risks. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect adversarial attacks in DRL using graph-based anomaly detection. Our method, dubbed 'GraphSentry', represents the agent's state-action trajectory as a graph and identifies anomalies by analyzing the structural patterns. We demonstrate the efficacy of GraphSentry on several DRL benchmarks, showcasing its ability to detect both targeted and untargeted attacks with high accuracy. Our approach has significant implications for improving the robustness of DRL systems in safety-critical applications.
