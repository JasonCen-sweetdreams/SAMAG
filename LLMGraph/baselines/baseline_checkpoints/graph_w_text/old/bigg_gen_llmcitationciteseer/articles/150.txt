In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often involve complex interactions and indirect influences. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable and interpretable decision-making in multi-agent environments. Our approach learns to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, providing a transparent and modular framework for decision-making. Experimental results on a real-world traffic management scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in improving decision quality and reducing uncertainty, while offering insights into the decision-making process.
