Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must coordinate to assign tasks without a central authority. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task allocation policies. We model the agent-task interactions as a graph and develop a GNN-based algorithm that learns to allocate tasks based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. Experiments on a simulated rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized algorithms and achieves near-optimal performance in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
