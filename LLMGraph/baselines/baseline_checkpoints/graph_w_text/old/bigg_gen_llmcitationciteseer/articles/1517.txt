Multi-tenant database systems require efficient query optimization to ensure fair resource allocation and minimize latency. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on a reward function that balances query latency, resource utilization, and tenant priority. Our experiments on a simulated multi-tenant database system show that our RL-based approach outperforms traditional cost-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of average query latency and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
