In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often involve complex interactions and uncertainties. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture to facilitate explainable decision-making in such scenarios. Our HAN model comprises multiple levels of attention mechanisms that capture agent-agent and agent-environment relationships, enabling the identification of key influencing factors and dependencies. We evaluate our approach using a series of simulation experiments and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving decision accuracy and transparency in various multi-agent domains.
