In multi-agent systems, coordinated exploration is crucial for efficient task allocation and resource utilization. This paper proposes a graph-based planning approach, called 'GraphExplore', to enable agents to jointly explore the environment while minimizing conflicts and maximizing information gain. We model the environment as a graph and use a decentralized planning algorithm to allocate exploration tasks to agents based on their capabilities and spatial relationships. Experimental results in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that GraphExplore outperforms existing approaches in terms of exploration efficiency and task completion time.
