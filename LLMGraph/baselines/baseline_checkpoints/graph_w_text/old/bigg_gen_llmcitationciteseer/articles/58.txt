Explainable recommendation systems have become increasingly important in recent years, as users seek transparency in personalized suggestions. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that integrates item relationships and user preferences to generate interpretable recommendations. HGAT leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to adaptively focus on relevant item features and neighbor interactions, while a graph autoencoder learns to extract compact user embeddings. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
