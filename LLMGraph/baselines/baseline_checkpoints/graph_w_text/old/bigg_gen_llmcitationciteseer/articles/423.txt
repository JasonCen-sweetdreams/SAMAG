Conversational search systems require a deep understanding of user context and intent to provide accurate and relevant responses. This paper introduces 'ConRank', a neural ranking model that leverages contextualized embeddings to capture the nuances of conversational queries. Our approach integrates a hierarchical attention mechanism with a graph-based contextualizer to jointly model the conversation history and the current query. Experimental results on a large-scale conversational search dataset demonstrate that ConRank significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of relevance and engagement metrics.
