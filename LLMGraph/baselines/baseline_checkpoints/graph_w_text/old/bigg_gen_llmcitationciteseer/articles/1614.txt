Modern recommendation systems rely on graph-based methods to model complex user-item interactions. However, scalability remains a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale datasets. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical graph representations to reduce computational complexity. HGAT incorporates attention mechanisms to adaptively weight node importance and enable efficient information propagation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by up to 70%
