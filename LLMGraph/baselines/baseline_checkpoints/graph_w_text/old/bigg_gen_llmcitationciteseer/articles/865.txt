Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly being used in real-world applications, but the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes hinders trust and accountability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable MAS decision-making. Our approach combines graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical reasoning to capture complex relationships between agents and their environments. We demonstrate the efficacy of HAN in a simulated traffic management scenario, showcasing improved decision-making interpretability and a 15% reduction in average travel time compared to state-of-the-art methods.
