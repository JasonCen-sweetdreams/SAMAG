As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible and inclusive human-computer interaction designs. This study investigates the design and evaluation of gestural interfaces tailored to older adults with mobility impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods approach, combining participatory design workshops with usability testing and motion capture analysis. Our results show that a gesture set incorporating adaptations for reduced mobility and dexterity can improve accuracy and user satisfaction among older adults. We also contribute a set of design guidelines for inclusive gestural interfaces, emphasizing the importance of user-centered design and participatory methods.
