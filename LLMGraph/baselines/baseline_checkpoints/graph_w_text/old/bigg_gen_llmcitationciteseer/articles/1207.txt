This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating inclusive gesture-based interfaces tailored to older adults with dementia. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with dementia, exploring their motor abilities, cognitive capacities, and preferences for gesture-based interactions. Our findings inform the development of a novel gesture recognition system that adapts to individual users' needs, incorporating compensatory strategies to accommodate motor and cognitive impairments. The results demonstrate improved user experience, reduced error rates, and enhanced accessibility for older adults with dementia.
