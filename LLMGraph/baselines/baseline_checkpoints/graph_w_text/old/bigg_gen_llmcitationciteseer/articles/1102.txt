Emotional empathy is a crucial aspect of human-human interaction, but its incorporation into human-computer interaction (HCI) remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a novel multimodal fusion approach to recognize and respond to users' emotional states in real-time. Our framework combines computer vision, speech processing, and physiological signal analysis to detect emotional cues, which are then used to generate empathetic responses. We evaluate our approach through a user study, demonstrating improved user satisfaction and emotional well-being compared to traditional, non-empathetic interfaces. Our findings have significant implications for the development of more empathetic and human-centered HCI systems.
