Distributed information retrieval systems face significant performance challenges due to the sheer scale of indexed data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, called 'HIER', which optimizes query processing by exploiting the structural properties of distributed collections. HIER constructs a multi-level index hierarchy, where each level is optimized for a specific query type, reducing the number of nodes traversed during query execution. Experiments on a large-scale web crawl dataset demonstrate that HIER achieves an average query latency reduction of 35% compared to existing distributed indexing techniques, while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy.
