Virtual reality (VR) has shown great potential in various domains, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatar appearance on user experience and engagement in VR. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR environment using either a default or personalized avatar. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, reported greater sense of presence, and demonstrated improved task performance compared to those using default avatars. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR-based applications and propose future research directions.
