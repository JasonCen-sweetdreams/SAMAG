Traffic signal control is a complex problem that requires real-time decision-making to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to optimize traffic signal control in large-scale networks. Our method, 'MARL-TSC', utilizes a graph neural network to represent the traffic network and a decentralized actor-critic framework to learn coordinated policies for each agent. We evaluate MARL-TSC on a real-world traffic network and demonstrate significant improvements in travel time and queue lengths compared to traditional control methods.
