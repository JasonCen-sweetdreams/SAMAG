Modern search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from massive indexes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE', which leverages both local and global context to disambiguate query terms and identify relevant documents. HQE adaptively applies query expansion techniques at multiple granularity levels, from individual terms to phrases and entities, to capture nuanced semantic relationships. Experimental results on the TREC-2022 dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency.
