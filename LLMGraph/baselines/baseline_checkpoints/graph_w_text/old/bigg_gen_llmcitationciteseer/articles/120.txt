Explainable recommendation systems are crucial for building trust with users. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention neural network (HANN) architecture that generates personalized recommendations and provides interpretable explanations for its suggestions. HANN consists of two stacked attention layers: the first layer attends to item features, and the second layer attends to user preferences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HANN on three real-world datasets, achieving significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our approach has great potential for applications in e-commerce, online advertising, and social media platforms.
