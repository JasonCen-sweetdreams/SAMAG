Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in this process, as it can significantly improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, dubbed 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn effective query representations. Specifically, we employ a transformer-based architecture to capture semantic relationships between query terms and generate expanded queries. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
