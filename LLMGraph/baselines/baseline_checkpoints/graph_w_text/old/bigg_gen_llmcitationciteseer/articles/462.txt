In today's search engines, users often encounter redundant or homogeneous search results, leading to poor search experience. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion (CAQE) approach to improve search result diversity. CAQE leverages user context, such as search history and location, to generate expanded queries that capture the user's intent more accurately. We employ a graph-based method to model the relationships between query terms and incorporate semantic features to disambiguate polysemous words. Experimental results on a large-scale search log dataset demonstrate that CAQE significantly improves search result diversity, with an average increase of 35% in novelty score.
