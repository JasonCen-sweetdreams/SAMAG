Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features to improve emotion recognition. We introduce a new attention mechanism that captures both intra-modal and inter-modal relationships, enabling the model to provide interpretable explanations for its predictions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in achieving state-of-the-art performance while offering insights into the emotional cues used for recognition.
