Explainable AI (XAI) has become a crucial aspect of trustworthy AI systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based neural network architecture, 'HierAttnXAI', which efficiently generates explanations for complex AI models. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to identify salient input features and highlight relevant interactions between them. We evaluate HierAttnXAI on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate improved explanation quality and computational efficiency compared to existing XAI methods. Our framework has significant implications for real-world AI applications, such as healthcare and finance, where model transparency is paramount.
