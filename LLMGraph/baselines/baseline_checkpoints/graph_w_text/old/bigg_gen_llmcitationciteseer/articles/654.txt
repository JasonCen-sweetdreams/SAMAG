In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a fundamental problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task assignment strategies. Our approach represents the agent-task graph as a heterogeneous graph, where agents and tasks are nodes, and edges represent feasibility and desirability. We design a GNN-based model that learns to predict task assignments based on local observations and communicates with neighboring agents to achieve consensus. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized methods in terms of task completion rate and communication overhead.
