Multi-tenancy is a key feature of modern cloud-based database systems, allowing multiple clients to share the same physical infrastructure. However, this sharing introduces complexities in query optimization, as conflicting resource demands from different tenants can lead to performance degradation. This paper presents a novel distributed query optimization framework, 'MQO', which leverages machine learning-based predictive modeling to anticipate and mitigate resource contention. MQO dynamically adjusts query plans and resource allocations to minimize interference between tenants, ensuring consistent performance and improving overall system utilization. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database show that MQO achieves an average of 30% improvement in query response times compared to traditional optimization techniques.
