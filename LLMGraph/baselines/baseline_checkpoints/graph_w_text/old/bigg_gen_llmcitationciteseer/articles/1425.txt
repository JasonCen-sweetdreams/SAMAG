Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but it also raises questions about the nature of embodied cognition in immersive environments. This paper presents a study on the effects of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load and user experience in VR. We designed an experiment where participants performed a series of tasks in a VR environment, using either gesture-based or controller-based input methods. Our results show that gesture-based interaction reduces cognitive load and improves user experience, particularly for tasks that require spatial reasoning. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of embodied interfaces in VR and their potential applications in fields such as education and therapy.
