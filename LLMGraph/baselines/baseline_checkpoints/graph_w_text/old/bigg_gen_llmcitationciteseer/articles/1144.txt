In multi-agent systems, decision-making algorithms must balance individual goals with collective objectives. We propose a novel, scalable approach that leverages hierarchical graph attention to model complex agent interactions. Our method, GraphAgent, represents agents as nodes in a hierarchical graph, enabling the capture of long-range dependencies and nuanced relationships. We demonstrate GraphAgent's effectiveness in a simulated traffic management scenario, where it outperforms existing methods in terms of scalability, adaptability, and overall system performance.
