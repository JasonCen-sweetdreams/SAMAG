Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in modern data analytics, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called 'DROOP', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy for selecting optimal join orders and indexing strategies based on the database's workload and system resources. We evaluate DROOP on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution times compared to traditional optimization techniques.
