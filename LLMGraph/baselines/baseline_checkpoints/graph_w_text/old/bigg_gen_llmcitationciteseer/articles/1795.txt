Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in domestic settings, but their accessibility and usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remain limited. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant system, 'CogniVA', tailored to the needs of this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the design of CogniVA's conversational interface, which incorporates adaptive speech recognition, personalized feedback mechanisms, and emotional support features. A usability study with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
