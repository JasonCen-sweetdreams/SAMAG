Column-oriented NoSQL databases have gained popularity for storing and querying large-scale data. However, existing indexing techniques are not optimized for real-time aggregate queries, leading to poor performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'CAIRO', that leverages a combination of column-level indexing, data skipping, and adaptive caching. We demonstrate that CAIRO achieves up to 5x improvement in query latency and 3x reduction in storage overhead compared to state-of-the-art solutions. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness of CAIRO in supporting real-time analytics workloads.
