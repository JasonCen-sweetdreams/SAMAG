This paper presents a novel multi-agent pathfinding algorithm that integrates real-time traffic information to optimize route planning for autonomous vehicles. Our approach leverages a decentralized agent-based framework, where each agent utilizes a probabilistic traffic model to predict traffic flow and adjust its route accordingly. We demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive simulations, showing significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional graph-based methods. The proposed approach has important implications for smart transportation systems and urban planning.
