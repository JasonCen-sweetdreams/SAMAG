Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large volumes of data and scale horizontally. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and use deep Q-networks to learn an optimal policy for selecting the best execution plan. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
