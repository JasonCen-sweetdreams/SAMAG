Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art results in information retrieval tasks, but their performance relies heavily on the quality of the query representation. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages contextualized embeddings to capture subtle semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, called ConEx, adaptively generates expansion terms by analyzing the contextualized embeddings of the original query terms and their co-occurrences in a large corpus. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that ConEx significantly improves the retrieval performance of neural models, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
