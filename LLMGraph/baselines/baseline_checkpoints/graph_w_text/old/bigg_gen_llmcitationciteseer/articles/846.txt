Distributed database systems face significant performance challenges due to complex query optimization. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query execution plans. We develop a deep reinforcement learning model that learns to predict optimal join orders and indexing strategies based on query patterns and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and throughput, outperforming traditional optimization techniques. Our approach enables adaptive and efficient query optimization, making distributed database systems more scalable and efficient.
