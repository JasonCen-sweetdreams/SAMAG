Cold start problem is a long-standing challenge in recommendation systems, where rating prediction for new users or items lacks sufficient training data. This paper proposes a novel hybrid retrieval model, HRM, which combines the strengths of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. HRM incorporates a graph-based attention mechanism to capture complex relationships between items and users, and a neural collaborative filtering module to leverage implicit feedback. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HRM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in addressing the cold start problem, achieving significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and diversity.
