Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query execution in these systems remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query planning in distributed graph databases. Our method utilizes graph neural networks to learn a query planner that can accurately predict the optimal execution plan for a given query. We evaluate our approach on a real-world graph dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time compared to traditional optimization techniques.
