Traditional ranking models in information retrieval rely on handcrafted features, which may not capture the complexity of queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel query-driven deep neural ranking (QDN) approach that leverages the power of neural networks to learn a unified representation of queries and documents. QDN leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to model the query-document interactions and a neural ranking module to predict the relevance scores. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QDN outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, particularly for long-tail queries.
