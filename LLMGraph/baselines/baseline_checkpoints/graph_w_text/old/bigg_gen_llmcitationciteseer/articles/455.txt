The proliferation of multimodal data has necessitated the development of effective information retrieval systems that can handle diverse data types. Query expansion techniques have been widely adopted in traditional text-based retrieval systems, but their applicability to multimodal scenarios remains underexplored. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of various query expansion methods in multimodal information retrieval, including relevance feedback, pseudo-relevance feedback, and semantic query expansion. We conduct experiments on a large-scale multimodal dataset and analyze the performance of these techniques using multiple evaluation metrics. The results provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach, informing the design of more effective multimodal retrieval systems.
