In dynamic environments, multi-agent systems often face the challenge of adaptive resource allocation. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to coordinate agents in allocating resources efficiently. We introduce a decentralized framework, 'MARLA', which enables agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate that MARLA outperforms traditional allocation methods, achieving improved resource utilization and reduced congestion.
