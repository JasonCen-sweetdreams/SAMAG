Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to scalable query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the DDS. Our approach, called 'RL-QOpt', uses a combination of exploration and exploitation strategies to adapt to changing data distributions and system workloads. Experimental results on a real-world DDS show that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
