State-of-the-art neural ranking models for document retrieval often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking framework, 'HiRank', which leverages a coarse-to-fine ranking strategy to reduce the computational overhead. HiRank employs a combination of sparse attention mechanisms and hierarchical document representations to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiRank achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency while maintaining comparable ranking accuracy to state-of-the-art models.
