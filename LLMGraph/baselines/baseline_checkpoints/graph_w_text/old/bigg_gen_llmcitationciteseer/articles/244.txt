Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, aiming to improve the retrieval accuracy by adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, DeepQE, which leverages the power of deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Our method utilizes a combination of word embeddings and recurrent neural networks to capture both local and global context information. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvement in recall and precision.
