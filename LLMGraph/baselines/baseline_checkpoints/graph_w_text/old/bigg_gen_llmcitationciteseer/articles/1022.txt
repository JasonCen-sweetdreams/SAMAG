In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient assignment of tasks to agents with varying capabilities. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal task assignment policies. The framework incorporates a novel, graph-based representation of agent capabilities and task requirements, enabling effective exploration and exploitation of the vast action space. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional, centralized methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and robustness to agent failures.
