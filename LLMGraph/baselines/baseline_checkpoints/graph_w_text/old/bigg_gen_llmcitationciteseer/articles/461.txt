Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to the variability in facial features and expressions. This paper proposes a hierarchical multi-task learning (HMTL) framework that adapts to individual differences in facial expressions. Our approach leverages a shared representation across multiple related tasks, including facial action unit recognition, emotion classification, and facial landmark detection. We introduce a novel hierarchical task graph that captures the relationships between tasks and enables efficient knowledge transfer. Experimental results on the FER2013 and EmoReact datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HMTL in improving recognition accuracy and robustness to expression variations.
