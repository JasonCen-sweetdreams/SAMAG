In complex multi-agent systems, task allocation is crucial for efficient collaboration. This paper presents a decentralized approach for task allocation in heterogeneous agent teams, where agents possess diverse capabilities and preferences. We formulate the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, seeking to balance task completion time, resource utilization, and agent satisfaction. Our proposed algorithm, 'HATeam', uses a distributed evolutionary optimization framework to adaptively allocate tasks, taking into account agent availability and workload. Simulation results demonstrate that HATeam outperforms existing centralized and decentralized approaches in terms of overall system performance and fairness.
