As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the nuances of human-robot collaboration in these environments is crucial. This paper explores the effect of embodiment on human-robot teaming in VR, focusing on the role of anthropomorphic robot avatars. Our user study (n=48) reveals that embodied robots elicit higher levels of trust, cooperation, and task performance compared to non-embodied robots. We identify key design implications for VR-based human-robot collaboration systems, highlighting the importance of anthropomorphic cues in facilitating effective teamwork.
