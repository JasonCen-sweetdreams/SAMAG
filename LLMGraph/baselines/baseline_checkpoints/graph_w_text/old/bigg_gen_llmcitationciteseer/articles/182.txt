Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize interactive experiences, but users with motor disabilities face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces that accommodate diverse motor abilities. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 participants with motor disabilities, resulting in a set of guidelines for adaptive controller design, gesture recognition, and haptic feedback. Our prototype, 'AccessVR', demonstrates improved usability and user satisfaction for participants with motor disabilities, and provides a foundation for future research in inclusive VR design.
