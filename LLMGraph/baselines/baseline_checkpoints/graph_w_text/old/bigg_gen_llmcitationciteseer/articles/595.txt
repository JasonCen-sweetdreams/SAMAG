Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. Despite the success of deep learning models, their lack of interpretability hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explanations for its predictions. HAN leverages a hierarchical representation of time series data, combining local and global attention mechanisms to identify anomalous patterns. We evaluate HAN on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and explainability.
