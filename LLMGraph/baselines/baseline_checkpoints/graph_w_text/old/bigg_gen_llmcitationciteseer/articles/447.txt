Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomizing them to either a personalized or default avatar condition. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, sense of presence, and overall satisfaction. We also identify key design factors that influence the effectiveness of personalized avatars, including facial resemblance and gesture fidelity. The findings of this study have implications for the design of future VR systems and applications.
