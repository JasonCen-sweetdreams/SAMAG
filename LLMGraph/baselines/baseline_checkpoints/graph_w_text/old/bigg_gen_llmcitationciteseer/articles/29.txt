Traditional time-series anomaly detection methods rely heavily on hand-crafted features and domain expertise. This paper introduces a novel deep learning approach, 'TSAD-Net', which leverages unsupervised representation learning to identify anomalies in multivariate time-series data. Our architecture combines a convolutional autoencoder with a reconstruction-based anomaly scoring mechanism, allowing for effective detection of diverse anomaly types. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that TSAD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to noisy data.
