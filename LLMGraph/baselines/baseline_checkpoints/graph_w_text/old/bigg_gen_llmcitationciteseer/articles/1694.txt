Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition tasks, but their opacity hinders trust and understanding. This paper presents a novel explainability framework, 'EmoXAI', which leverages attention mechanisms and gradient-based saliency maps to provide interpretable insights into the decision-making process of neural network-based emotion recognition models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EmoXAI on a benchmark dataset, showing that it outperforms existing explainability techniques in terms of faithfulness and interpretability. Our approach has significant implications for real-world applications, such as affective computing and human-computer interaction.
