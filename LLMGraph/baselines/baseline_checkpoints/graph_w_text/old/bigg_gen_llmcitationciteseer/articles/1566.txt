Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants, focusing on individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We conducted a mixed-methods study involving surveys, interviews, and usability testing with 25 older adults with MCI. Our findings highlight the importance of providing clear and simple voice prompts, minimizing cognitive load, and incorporating memory aids to support users with MCI. We propose a set of design guidelines and a prototype voice assistant, 'EasyVoice', which demonstrates significant improvements in usability and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
