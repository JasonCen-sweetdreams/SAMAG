Specialized Information Retrieval (SIR) systems face the challenge of limited domain-specific training data, leading to poor query representation and retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages word embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms in a specialized domain. Our method, 'EmbedExpan', uses a combination of word2vec and domain-specific term weighting to generate expanded query representations that better match the underlying document semantics. Experimental results on a biomedical SIR benchmark dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
