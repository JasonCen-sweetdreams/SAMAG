Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to generate context-aware, semantically rich query representations. By incorporating a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes term weighting and ranking, DeepQE significantly improves retrieval performance on standard TREC benchmarks. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 15% relative improvement in mean average precision.
