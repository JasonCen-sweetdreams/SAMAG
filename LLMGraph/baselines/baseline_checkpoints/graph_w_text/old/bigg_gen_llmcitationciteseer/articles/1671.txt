Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face significant challenges in efficiently processing complex queries. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing approach, 'AIQ', that dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distributions. AIQ leverages a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify correlated query terms and adaptively creates indexes for efficient query processing. Our experiments on a large-scale DIR system demonstrate that AIQ reduces query latency by up to 35% and improves query throughput by up to 25% compared to traditional indexing methods.
