Conversational search engines have become increasingly popular, but accurately detecting user intent behind natural language queries remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised approach, 'IntentMine', which leverages a combination of language modeling and graph-based clustering to identify latent query intents. We evaluate IntentMine on a large-scale conversational search dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in intent detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art supervised models. Furthermore, we show that IntentMine can effectively generalize to unseen queries and domains, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the user experience in conversational search systems.
