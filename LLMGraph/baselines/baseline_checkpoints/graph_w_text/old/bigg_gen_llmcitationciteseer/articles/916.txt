Graph neural networks have shown promising results in node classification tasks, but often struggle with evolving graphs where nodes and edges are dynamically added or removed. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that captures both local and global graph structure to improve node classification in evolving graphs. HGAN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant nodes and edges at each level of the graph hierarchy. We evaluate HGAN on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over existing graph neural network models in terms of node classification accuracy and robustness to graph changes.
