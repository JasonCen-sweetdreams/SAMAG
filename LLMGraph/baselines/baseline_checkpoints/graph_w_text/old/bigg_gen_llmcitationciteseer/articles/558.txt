Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short and ambiguous queries. This paper introduces a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of query terms. Our model, dubbed 'QNLP', employs a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query term embeddings and relevance ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QNLP outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
