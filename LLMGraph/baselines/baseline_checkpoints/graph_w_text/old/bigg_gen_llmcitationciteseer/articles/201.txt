This paper presents an embodied conversational agent (ECA) framework designed to enhance user engagement in virtual reality (VR) environments. We introduce a novel gesture-based communication model that enables ECAs to adapt to users' nonverbal cues, fostering a sense of social presence and immersion. Our user study reveals that our ECA framework significantly improves users' self-reported feelings of engagement, enjoyment, and perceived social support in VR-based educational scenarios. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of ECAs in VR and highlight avenues for future research.
