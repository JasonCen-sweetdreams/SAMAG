In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task assignments. Our approach, called TAGNN, models the agent-agent interactions as a graph and uses a GNN to predict task affinities. We demonstrate the efficacy of TAGNN in a variety of task allocation scenarios, showcasing improved solution quality and scalability compared to traditional optimization-based methods. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of TAGNN under certain graph structures.
