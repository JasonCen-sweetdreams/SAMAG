This study explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) environments to enhance user experience. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR simulation using an avatar that provided haptic and visual feedback. Our results show that avatar-based feedback significantly improved users' sense of presence and engagement, while also reducing cognitive load. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems and propose future research directions for incorporating embodied cognition in HCI.
