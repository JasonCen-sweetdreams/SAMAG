Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture, 'ExplainAT', which learns to identify anomalies by selectively focusing on relevant temporal and spatial patterns. Our approach leverages a hierarchical self-attention mechanism to capture complex dependencies across multiple scales, while an interpretable attention module provides insights into the anomaly detection process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that ExplainAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness, while offering valuable explanations for its predictions.
