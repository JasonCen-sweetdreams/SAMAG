In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often rely on complex interactions and uncertain information. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture, capable of modeling agent relationships and reasoning about their decision-making processes. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to learn agent representations, which are then used to predict decision outcomes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a simulated traffic management scenario, showcasing improved decision accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional machine learning methods. Our results have significant implications for the development of explainable and trustworthy multi-agent systems.
