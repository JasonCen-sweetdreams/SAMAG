In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages adaptive auction-based approaches to optimize task assignments. Our method, called Auction-based Task Allocation with Reinforcement learning (ATAR), combines reinforcement learning with auction theory to dynamically adjust bidding strategies and task prices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ATAR in various simulation scenarios, showcasing significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system utility compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
