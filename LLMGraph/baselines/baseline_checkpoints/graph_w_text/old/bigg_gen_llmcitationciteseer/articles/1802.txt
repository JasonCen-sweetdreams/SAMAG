Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but existing methods often rely on simplistic weighting schemes or lack robustness to noise. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE-Net', which leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our approach employs a tree-structured attention mechanism to recursively refine query representations, incorporating both local and global context. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQE-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and robustness to query drift.
