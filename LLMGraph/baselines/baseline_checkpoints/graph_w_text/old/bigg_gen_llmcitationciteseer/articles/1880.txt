Knowledge graph embeddings have become a crucial component in various AI applications. However, the presence of ambiguous entities can significantly compromise their performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical entity disambiguation approach, HEDGE, which leverages both local and global context to resolve entity ambiguities. HEDGE employs a graph attention mechanism to capture complex relationships between entities and a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group similar entities. Our experiments on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that HEDGE outperforms state-of-the-art disambiguation methods, leading to improved knowledge graph embedding quality and downstream task performance.
