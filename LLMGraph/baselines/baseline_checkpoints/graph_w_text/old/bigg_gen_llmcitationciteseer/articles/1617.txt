As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly pervasive, securing user authentication in AR head-mounted displays (HMDs) is crucial. We present a novel gaze-based authentication approach that leverages the unique properties of AR HMDs. Our method, 'GazeLock', utilizes machine learning-based gaze tracking to identify users based on their unique gaze patterns. We conducted a user study with 30 participants and achieved a false acceptance rate of 2.1% and a false rejection rate of 4.5%. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of gaze-based authentication for AR HMDs, offering a promising alternative to traditional authentication methods.
