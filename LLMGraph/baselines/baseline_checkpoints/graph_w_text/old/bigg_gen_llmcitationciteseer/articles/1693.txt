This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'DRL-TA', which enables agents to learn optimal task assignment strategies in complex, dynamic environments. Our approach leverages a hybrid DQN-A2C architecture to balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring efficient task allocation while minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms traditional graph-based methods in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization.
