Query expansion is a crucial step in modern information retrieval systems, but it can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with dynamic document collections. This paper proposes a novel index maintenance strategy, 'DynamiX', which leverages incremental clustering and Bloom filters to efficiently update the index in response to document insertions, deletions, and updates. Our approach reduces the average query latency by up to 35% compared to existing methods while maintaining a high recall rate. Experimental results on the TREC WT10g dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DynamiX in real-time query expansion scenarios.
