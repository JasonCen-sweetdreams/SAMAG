Multi-agent systems face the challenge of coordinating individual actions to achieve a common goal. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable cooperation among agents. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively weigh the importance of individual agent observations, facilitating adaptive decision-making at both local and global levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a simulated robotic soccer environment, showcasing improved team performance and enhanced interpretability of agent interactions.
