Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering or exhaustive searching. This paper presents a novel approach, 'RL-QE', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion. We formulate the query expansion task as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to select relevant terms to add to the query based on feedback from the retrieval system. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing computational overhead.
