Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their accessibility and usability for older adults remain understudied. This paper presents a multimodal interaction study investigating the design of inclusive voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, exploring their experiences with current voice assistants and identifying design recommendations for improved accessibility. Our results highlight the importance of adaptive speech recognition, visual feedback, and simplified dialogue flows. We propose a novel interaction framework, 'ElderVoice', which integrates these design principles to promote more effective and engaging interactions for older adults.
