Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence, with applications in robotics, video games, and logistics. However, existing algorithms struggle with scalability as the number of agents increases. We propose a novel hierarchical graph decomposition approach, 'HierMAPF', which leverages the structure of the environment to reduce the MAPF problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that HierMAPF outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on large-scale scenarios, achieving speedups of up to 10x while maintaining solution quality.
