Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial in various domains, such as finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our HAN model consists of two levels of attention: (1) a local attention mechanism that identifies relevant features within a time window, and (2) a global attention mechanism that aggregates feature importance across windows. We evaluate our approach on three real-world datasets and demonstrate improved accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
