Cooperative task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, especially when agents have different capabilities and preferences. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'Coop-MA', which enables agents to learn cooperative strategies for task allocation. We introduce a novel reward function that incorporates both individual and team performance, and a communication protocol that facilitates knowledge sharing among agents. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that Coop-MA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods and achieves higher task completion rates.
