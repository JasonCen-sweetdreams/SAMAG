Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying key challenges and design recommendations. Our proposed system incorporates cognitive support features, such as verbal cues, multimodal feedback, and error forgiveness, to facilitate effective interaction and reduce user frustration. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
