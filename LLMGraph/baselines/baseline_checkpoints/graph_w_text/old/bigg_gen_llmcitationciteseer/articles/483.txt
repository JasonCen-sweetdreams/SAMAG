Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular in modern data centers, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to improve query optimization in DDS. We propose a novel framework, 'MLQuery', which leverages query execution statistics and database metadata to train a predictive model that recommends optimal query plans. Our experimental results on a real-world DDS workload show that MLQuery achieves an average query performance improvement of 23% compared to traditional optimization techniques.
