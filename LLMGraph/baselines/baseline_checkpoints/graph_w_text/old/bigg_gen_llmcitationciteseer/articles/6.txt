Query optimization is a crucial step in database systems, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of distributed databases. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and propose a deep Q-network-based algorithm to learn the optimal query plan. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
