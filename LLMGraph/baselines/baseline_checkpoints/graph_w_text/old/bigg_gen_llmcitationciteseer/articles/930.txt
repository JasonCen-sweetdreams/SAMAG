Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and improve query performance. However, optimizing queries in these systems is a complex task, as it involves considering various factors such as data distribution, network latency, and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the system's current state and the query's characteristics. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
