Neural retrieval models have revolutionized the field of information retrieval, but their performance is often hindered by the vocabulary mismatch problem. Query expansion techniques can alleviate this issue, but most existing methods rely on traditional term-based approaches. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to adaptively select expansion terms. Our approach, dubbed 'NeuQE', uses a neural network to learn a semantic representation of the query and pseudo-relevant documents, and then generates expansion terms based on their similarity. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
