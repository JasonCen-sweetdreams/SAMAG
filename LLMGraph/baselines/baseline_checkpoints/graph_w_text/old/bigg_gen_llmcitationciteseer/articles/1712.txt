Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing tasks. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexities of distributed query planning and execution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design a deep RL framework that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment and receiving rewards based on query performance. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
