This paper proposes a novel document expansion approach for ad-hoc retrieval, which leverages BERT-based sentence embeddings to selectively incorporate relevant sentences from external resources. Our method, called Query-Focused Sentence Expansion (QFSE), first generates a set of query-focused sentences using a BERT-based sentence encoder. These sentences are then used to expand the original document, leading to improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that QFSE outperforms state-of-the-art document expansion techniques, achieving a significant increase in mean average precision.
