Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, but existing methods struggle to scale to large datasets. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraphDisamb', which leverages the structural properties of knowledge graphs to efficiently disambiguate entities. By constructing a hierarchical graph index, GraphDisamb prunes the search space and reduces the number of comparisons required, resulting in significant speedups. Experimental evaluations on several large-scale knowledge graphs demonstrate that GraphDisamb outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
