Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their adoption among older adults remains limited due to accessibility and usability concerns. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction framework for designing inclusive voice assistants tailored to the needs of older adults. Our approach combines speech recognition, gesture recognition, and visual feedback to provide a more intuitive and accessible experience. A user study with 30 older adults demonstrates that our framework improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional voice assistants.
