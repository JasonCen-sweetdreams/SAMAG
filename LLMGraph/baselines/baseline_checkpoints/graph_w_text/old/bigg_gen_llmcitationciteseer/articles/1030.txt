Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle massive amounts of data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization, which models the database as a graph and leverages graph neural networks to learn optimal query plans. Our approach, called GraphOpt, outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time and reduces the number of query rewrites by 25%. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness in handling complex queries.
