Real-time search engines require efficient document indexing techniques to facilitate rapid query processing. This paper presents a novel approach, NeuralHash, which leverages neural networks to learn compact binary representations of documents. By exploiting the properties of locality-sensitive hashing, NeuralHash enables fast similarity search and outperforms traditional indexing methods. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that NeuralHash reduces indexing time by 3.5x and improves query latency by 2x compared to state-of-the-art methods.
