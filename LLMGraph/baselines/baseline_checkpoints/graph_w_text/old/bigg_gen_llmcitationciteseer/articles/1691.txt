Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a popular technique to improve retrieval performance. However, traditional methods rely on heuristics and may not capture the nuances of query semantics. This paper proposes a neural re-ranking approach, 'NeuQE', which leverages a transformer-based architecture to learn robust query representations and expand queries effectively. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
