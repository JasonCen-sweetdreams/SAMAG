This paper presents a human-centered design approach to creating conversational interfaces accessible to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with caregivers and individuals with mild cognitive impairment to identify key challenges and opportunities in conversational interface design. Our findings highlight the importance of simplifying language, using visual cues, and providing error forgiveness. We propose a set of design guidelines and evaluate their effectiveness through a usability study with a prototype conversational agent. The results demonstrate improved engagement and task completion rates among older adults with cognitive impairments, suggesting the potential for more inclusive and supportive conversational interfaces.
