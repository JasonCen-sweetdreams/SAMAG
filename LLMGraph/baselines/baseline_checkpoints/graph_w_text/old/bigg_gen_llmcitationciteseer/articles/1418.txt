Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their effectiveness is hindered for older adults due to limitations in speech recognition and feedback mechanisms. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create personalized feedback mechanisms for older adults, focusing on cognitive and accessibility aspects. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, aged 65+, to explore their interaction patterns and preferences. Our findings suggest that adaptive feedback mechanisms, incorporating visual and tactile cues, significantly improve user experience and task completion rates. We propose a framework for designing inclusive voice assistants, highlighting the importance of user feedback in shaping intelligent interfaces.
