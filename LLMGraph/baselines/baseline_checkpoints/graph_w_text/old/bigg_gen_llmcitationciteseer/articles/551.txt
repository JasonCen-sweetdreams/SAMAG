Distributed database systems are increasingly used to manage large-scale data, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called 'DRL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy for selecting efficient query plans based on database statistics and workload characteristics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that DRL-QOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
