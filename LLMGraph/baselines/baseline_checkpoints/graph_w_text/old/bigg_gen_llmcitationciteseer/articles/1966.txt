Column-oriented database systems have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to efficiently store and query large datasets. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach, 'ColOpt', which leverages statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to predict the most efficient query execution plan. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ColOpt through extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets, showing significant performance improvements over existing query optimization techniques.
