Distributed data warehouses have become increasingly popular for scalable analytics. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of cardinality estimation. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'LCE-DW', which leverages machine learning to learn cardinality estimation models from query logs and optimize query plans. We develop a hybrid model that combines traditional statistical methods with deep neural networks to improve estimation accuracy. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that LCE-DW reduces query latency by up to 35% and improves estimation accuracy by 20% compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
