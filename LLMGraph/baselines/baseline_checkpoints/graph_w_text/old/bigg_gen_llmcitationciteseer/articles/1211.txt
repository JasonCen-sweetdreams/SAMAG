The proliferation of main-memory databases has led to a resurgence of interest in optimizing subquery processing. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to accelerate subquery evaluation. We introduce 'LISub', a framework that utilizes machine learning models to predict the optimal subquery execution plan. Our experiments on a real-world benchmark demonstrate that LISub outperforms state-of-the-art subquery optimization techniques by up to 3.5x, while reducing memory allocation overhead by 40%. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the optimality guarantees of our approach.
