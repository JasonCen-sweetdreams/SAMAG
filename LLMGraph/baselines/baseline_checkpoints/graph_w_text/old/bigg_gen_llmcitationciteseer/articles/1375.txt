The increasing demand for real-time analytics in distributed database systems has led to the development of various query optimization techniques. However, these techniques often rely on static cost models, which can be inaccurate in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DynOpt', that leverages machine learning to predict query execution times and optimize query plans in real-time. We evaluate DynOpt on a distributed database system and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing query optimization techniques.
