Explainable AI (XAI) has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in conversational AI systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based approach for multi-domain conversational dialogue systems, enabling the generation of interpretable and explainable responses. Our method leverages a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating attention mechanisms at both the utterance and domain levels. We evaluate our approach on a multi-domain conversational dataset, demonstrating improved response quality, coherence, and explainability compared to existing state-of-the-art models.
