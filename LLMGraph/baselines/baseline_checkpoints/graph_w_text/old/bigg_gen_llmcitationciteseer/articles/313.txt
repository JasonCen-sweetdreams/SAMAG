Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often overlooks the needs of individuals with dyslexia. This paper presents an exploratory study investigating the challenges faced by dyslexic individuals when interacting with conversational systems. We conducted user studies and interviews to identify key pain points and opportunities for improvement. Based on our findings, we propose a set of design guidelines for creating more inclusive conversational interfaces, including the use of visual cues, phonetic spelling, and adaptive language processing. A prototype system incorporating these guidelines showed significant improvements in user experience and accuracy for dyslexic participants.
