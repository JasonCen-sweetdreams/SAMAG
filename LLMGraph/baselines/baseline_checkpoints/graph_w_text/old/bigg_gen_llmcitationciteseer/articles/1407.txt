Unsupervised time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical contrastive learning framework, 'HiCAD', which leverages self-supervised learning to identify anomalies in time-series data. HiCAD hierarchically clusters time-series segments and applies contrastive learning at multiple scales, enabling the model to capture both local and global patterns. We evaluate HiCAD on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall.
