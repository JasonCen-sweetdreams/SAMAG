Cloud providers face significant challenges in efficiently allocating resources to multiple tenants with varying workloads. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach to adaptive resource allocation in multi-tenant cloud environments. Our RL agent, 'CloudOptimizer', learns to optimize resource allocation based on real-time workload patterns, minimizing resource waste and improving overall system utilization. We evaluate CloudOptimizer on a real-world cloud dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in resource efficiency and tenant satisfaction compared to traditional static allocation policies.
