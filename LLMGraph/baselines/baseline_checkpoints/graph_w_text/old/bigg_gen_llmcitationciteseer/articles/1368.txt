Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their accessibility limitations hinder interactions for people with disabilities. This paper presents an inclusive dialogue management framework, 'AccuDial', which integrates contextual understanding, user modeling, and adaptive response generation to facilitate accessible conversations. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, including individuals with visual, hearing, and motor impairments, and demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates, user satisfaction, and perceived accessibility compared to existing conversational systems.
