In multi-agent systems, decision-making agents must often balance individual goals with collective objectives. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables agents to selectively focus on relevant information from other agents and the environment, leading to more informed and explainable decisions. Our HAN model consists of two stages: intra-agent attention to identify key features and inter-agent attention to aggregate information across agents. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decision-making methods in terms of both task performance and interpretability.
