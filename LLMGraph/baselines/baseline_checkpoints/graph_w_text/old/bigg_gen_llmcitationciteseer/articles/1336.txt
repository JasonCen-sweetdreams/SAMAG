Multimodal time series forecasting is a challenging problem that arises in various applications, including climate modeling, healthcare, and finance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that integrates multiple modalities and captures complex dependencies across different time scales. HGAT employs a multi-level attention mechanism that adaptively weighs the importance of each modality and time step, enabling effective fusion of information from heterogeneous data sources. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HGAT compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in forecasting accuracy and robustness.
