Multi-label extreme classification involves assigning a large number of labels to instances, where the number of labels is exponentially large compared to the number of instances. We propose a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages the label hierarchy to improve classification performance. Our HAN model consists of a label-aware attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant label subsets and a hierarchical label embedding that captures semantic relationships between labels. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
