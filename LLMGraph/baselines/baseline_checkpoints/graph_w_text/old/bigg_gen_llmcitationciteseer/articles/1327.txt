Virtual reality (VR) technology has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information. However, traditional input methods, such as controllers or keyboards, can be restrictive and hinder the sense of immersion. This paper explores the potential of gaze-based interaction in VR, where users can manipulate virtual objects using their gaze. We conducted a user study to evaluate the usability and performance of gaze-based interaction in a VR environment, comparing it with traditional input methods. Our results show that gaze-based interaction can improve user experience and reduce task completion time, but also introduce new challenges related to eye-tracking accuracy and user fatigue.
