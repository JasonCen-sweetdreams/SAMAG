In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects the overall efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel cooperative task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task assignments. Our approach represents the agent-task graph as a probabilistic graph, and uses a GNN to learn a task allocation policy that maximizes the global reward. We evaluate our framework on a real-world robotics dataset and show that it outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and agent utilization.
