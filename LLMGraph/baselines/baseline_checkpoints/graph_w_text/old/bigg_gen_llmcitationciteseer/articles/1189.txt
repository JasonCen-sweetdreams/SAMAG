Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the system's current state and the query's characteristics. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization. We also demonstrate the scalability and adaptability of our approach in various distributed database settings.
