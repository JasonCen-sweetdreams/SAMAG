In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphAgent', that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent-agent interactions and task dependencies. GraphAgent learns to coordinate task assignments by predicting agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication costs. We evaluate our approach on a variety of simulated scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional methods. GraphAgent has applications in domains such as robotic teams, autonomous vehicles, and disaster response.
