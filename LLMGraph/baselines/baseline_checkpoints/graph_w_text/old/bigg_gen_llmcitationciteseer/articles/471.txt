Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks, but their scalability is limited by the need for labeled data and computational resources. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture that enables scalable semi-supervised node classification. HGAN leverages a hierarchical clustering scheme to construct a multi-resolution graph representation, which is then fed into a graph attention network that adaptively focuses on relevant nodes and features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN on several large-scale graph benchmarks, achieving significant improvements in classification accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing GNN-based methods.
