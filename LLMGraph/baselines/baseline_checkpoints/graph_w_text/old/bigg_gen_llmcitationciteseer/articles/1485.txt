Distributed database systems (DDBS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck in these systems. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing technique, called ADI, which dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. ADI leverages a cost-based optimization framework to select the most effective indexing scheme, reducing query latency by up to 40% compared to traditional indexing methods. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world DDBS setup demonstrates the efficacy of ADI in improving query performance and reducing resource utilization.
