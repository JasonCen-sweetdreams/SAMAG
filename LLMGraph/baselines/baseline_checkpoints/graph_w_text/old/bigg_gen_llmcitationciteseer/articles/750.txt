Optimizing query execution plans is crucial for distributed database systems. However, the complexity of modern databases and the vast space of possible plans make it challenging to find efficient solutions. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict the optimal plan based on query characteristics and database statistics. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant performance improvements, with an average reduction of 35% in query execution time compared to traditional optimization techniques.
