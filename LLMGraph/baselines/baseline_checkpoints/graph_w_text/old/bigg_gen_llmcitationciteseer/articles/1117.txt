Existing neural ranking models for information retrieval often face scalability issues when dealing with large document collections. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural ranking approach, HierRank, which leverages document clustering and hierarchical attention mechanisms to efficiently filter out irrelevant documents. We evaluate HierRank on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in ranking accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models. Our approach has potential applications in web search, question answering, and other IR systems.
