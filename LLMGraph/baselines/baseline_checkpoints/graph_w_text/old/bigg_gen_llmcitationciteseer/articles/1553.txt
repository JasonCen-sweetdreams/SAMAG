Effective negotiation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents interact to achieve mutually beneficial agreements. This paper presents a novel approach to negotiation strategy learning using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a hierarchical framework, 'AgentNegotiator', which combines a high-level negotiation policy with a low-level communication strategy. Our approach enables agents to adapt to changing negotiation scenarios and opponents, resulting in improved agreement rates and social welfare. Experimental results in a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate the superiority of AgentNegotiator over traditional negotiation strategies.
