Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing insights into the contributing factors. Our model employs a two-level attention mechanism, focusing on both local and global patterns in the time series. We evaluate HAN on several real-world datasets, demonstrating its superiority in anomaly detection and interpretability over state-of-the-art methods. We also provide visualizations of the attention weights, facilitating understanding of the anomaly detection process.
