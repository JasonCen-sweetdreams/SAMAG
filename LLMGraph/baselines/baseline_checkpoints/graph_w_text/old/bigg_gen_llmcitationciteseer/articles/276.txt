Recommendation systems have become increasingly important in e-commerce and online services. However, most existing methods suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large user-item graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages both node- and graph-level attention mechanisms to efficiently model complex relationships between users and items. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world recommendation systems.
