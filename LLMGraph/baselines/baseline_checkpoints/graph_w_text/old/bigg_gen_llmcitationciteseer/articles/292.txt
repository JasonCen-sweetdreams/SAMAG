Traditional document ranking models rely on handcrafted features and simplistic query-document interaction methods, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'BERT-QDI', which leverages the power of BERT-based language models to capture nuanced query-document semantics. By introducing a deep query-document interaction mechanism, BERT-QDI effectively models the relationships between query terms and document contents, resulting in significant improvements in ranking accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of BERT-QDI, outperforming state-of-the-art models in various information retrieval tasks.
