Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience in VR. We designed a user study to compare the effects of customized avatars versus generic ones on user motivation, sense of presence, and overall satisfaction. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, particularly among users with high self-identity scores. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR system design and provide recommendations for incorporating avatar personalization in future HCI applications.
