Optimizing join orders is crucial for query performance in distributed database systems. However, data skew, a common phenomenon in real-world datasets, can significantly affect the efficacy of join order optimization techniques. This paper investigates the impact of data skew on state-of-the-art join order optimization algorithms and proposes a novel skew-aware optimization framework, 'SkewOpt'. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale distributed database system shows that SkewOpt outperforms existing optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, particularly in the presence of high data skew.
