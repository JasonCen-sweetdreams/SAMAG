Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the varying importance of each modality across different contexts. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that learned to selectively focus on the most relevant modalities and features for emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of three levels of attention: modality-level, feature-level, and instance-level. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MMIMAV datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.
