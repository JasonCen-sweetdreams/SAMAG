Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when users submit short and ambiguous queries. Query expansion techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, but they often rely on manual feature engineering and may not capture complex semantic relationships. This paper introduces a novel deep neural network-based approach for query expansion, which learns to represent queries and documents as dense vectors and expands queries based on their semantic similarity. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods and achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance.
