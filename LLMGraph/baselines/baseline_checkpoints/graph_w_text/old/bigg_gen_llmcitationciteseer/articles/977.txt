E-commerce search engines require efficient and accurate query processing to provide users with relevant product results. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion (CAQE) approach that leverages user behavior, product categories, and semantic relationships to expand queries. Our CAQE method uses a graph-based representation to capture contextual information and incorporates a reinforcement learning-based ranking model to optimize query expansion. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that CAQE improves search efficiency by 30% and retrieval accuracy by 15% compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
