Autonomous systems, such as robotic teams or drone swarms, require efficient task allocation methods to achieve complex goals. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for distributed task allocation. We introduce a novel communication protocol that enables agents to share observations and negotiate task assignments, improving overall system performance. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
