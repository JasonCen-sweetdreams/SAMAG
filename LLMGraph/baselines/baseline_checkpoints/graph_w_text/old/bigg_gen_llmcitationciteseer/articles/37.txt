Virtual reality (VR) systems often struggle to accurately recognize user intentions, leading to frustrating interactions. This paper presents a novel gaze-based intention recognition framework that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to infer user goals in VR environments. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for gaze tracking with a probabilistic intention recognition model, allowing for real-time adaptation to user behavior. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in intention recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional approaches.
