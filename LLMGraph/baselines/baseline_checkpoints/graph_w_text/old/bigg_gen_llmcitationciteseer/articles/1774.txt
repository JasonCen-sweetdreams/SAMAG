Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We propose an RL agent that learns to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies for complex queries, leveraging a reward function that balances query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database show that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers, achieving up to 3x speedup on complex analytical queries.
