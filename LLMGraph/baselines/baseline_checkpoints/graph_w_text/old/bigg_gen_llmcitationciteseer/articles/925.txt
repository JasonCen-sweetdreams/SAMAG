Graph databases have emerged as a powerful tool for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, as graph sizes continue to grow, query optimization becomes a significant challenge, especially in distributed settings. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework for distributed graph databases, which leverages graph partitioning, parallel query execution, and optimized join ordering. We evaluate our approach on a real-world social network dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and scalability.
