Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial task in natural language processing, but existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that efficiently captures aspect-specific sentiment by leveraging multi-granular attention mechanisms. Our approach comprises a sentence-level attention module that identifies relevant aspects and a review-level attention module that aggregates sentiment polarities. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HAN model in achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational costs by up to 30%.
