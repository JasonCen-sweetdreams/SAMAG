Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern data centers, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic workloads and system configurations. Our method, 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy from trial executions and feedback. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database system demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
