Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query formulations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'QERL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize the query expansion process. By framing query expansion as a Markov decision process, QERL learns to select relevant terms that maximize the expected retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate that QERL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
