Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly prevalent in modern data-driven applications. However, optimizing queries in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed data and varying workloads. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-Opt', which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to learn optimal query execution plans. RL-Opt utilizes a deep Q-network to estimate the expected latency of different query plans and adapts to changing workloads through online learning. Our experiments on a real-world DDS dataset show that RL-Opt reduces average query latency by up to 30% compared to existing optimization techniques.
