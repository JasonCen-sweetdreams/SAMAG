The increasing adoption of Resource Description Framework (RDF) in big data and artificial intelligence applications has created a pressing need for efficient query processing techniques. This paper presents 'RDF-X', a novel indexing framework that leverages the parallel processing capabilities of modern CPU architectures to accelerate RDF query execution. RDF-X employs a hybrid indexing strategy that combines a sparse matrix representation with a novel compression scheme, achieving significant reductions in memory footprint and query latency. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that RDF-X outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time.
