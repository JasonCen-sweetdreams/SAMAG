E-commerce search engines often struggle to retrieve relevant results due to the ambiguity and complexity of user queries. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages user behavior, search history, and product attributes to disambiguate queries and expand them with relevant terms. CAQE employs a graph-based method to model the relationships between queries, products, and attributes, and incorporates a deep learning-based ranking model to re-rank the expanded query results. Our experimental evaluation on a large e-commerce dataset shows that CAQE significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
