Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems generate vast amounts of time-series data, making anomaly detection a crucial task. This paper presents Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs), a novel deep learning architecture for identifying anomalies in IIoT data. HANs combine hierarchical feature extraction with attention mechanisms to capture complex temporal dependencies and localized patterns. We evaluate HANs on a large-scale dataset from a manufacturing plant and demonstrate improved detection accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach has significant implications for real-time monitoring and fault diagnosis in IIoT systems.
