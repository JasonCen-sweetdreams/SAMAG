Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems is challenging due to the complexity of graph traversal and distributed query planning. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to select optimal query plans based on graph structure and query patterns. Our approach, called GraphOpt, is shown to outperform state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization on a variety of graph datasets.
