Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but individuals with motor impairments face significant barriers in accessing and interacting with VR systems. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces tailored to the needs of individuals with motor impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and developed a set of guidelines for creating adaptable, intuitive, and accessible VR interfaces. Our approach incorporates machine learning-based gesture recognition, personalized interface customization, and haptic feedback to enhance user experience and engagement.
