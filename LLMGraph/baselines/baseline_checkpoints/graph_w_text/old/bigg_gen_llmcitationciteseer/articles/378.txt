Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large datasets. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based indexing approach that reduces query latency and improves overall system performance. Our approach represents the database schema as a graph and leverages graph clustering algorithms to identify optimal index configurations. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
