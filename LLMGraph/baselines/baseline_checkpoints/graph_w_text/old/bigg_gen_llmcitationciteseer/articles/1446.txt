Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable suggestions to users. However, existing methods often rely on simplistic user-item interaction models or overlook the rich structural information in user behavior graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that incorporates multi-level attention mechanisms to capture complex user preferences and item relationships. We demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods on three real-world datasets, while providing insights into the key factors influencing recommendation outcomes.
