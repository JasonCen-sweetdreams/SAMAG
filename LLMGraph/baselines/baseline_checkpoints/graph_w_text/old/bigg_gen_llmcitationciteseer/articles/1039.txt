In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn distributed task allocation policies. Our method, 'GraphAgent', represents the agent network as a graph and uses GNNs to learn node representations that capture task dependencies and agent capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAgent in various scenarios, including disaster response and warehouse robotics, and show that it outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
