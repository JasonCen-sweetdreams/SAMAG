This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We propose an auction-based mechanism that leverages the unique capabilities and preferences of individual agents to allocate tasks efficiently. Our approach utilizes a combinatorial auction framework that allows agents to bid on tasks based on their expertise and availability. We provide theoretical guarantees on the optimality and stability of the allocation, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations on a variety of scenarios.
