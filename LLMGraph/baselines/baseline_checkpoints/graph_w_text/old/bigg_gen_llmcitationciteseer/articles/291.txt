Few-shot learning on graph-structured data is a challenging task, especially when node labels are scarce. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages self-supervised learning and few-shot classification. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and their neighborhoods, enabling effective node representation learning. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art few-shot graph learning methods, achieving an average accuracy gain of 12.5% on the ogbn-arxiv dataset.
