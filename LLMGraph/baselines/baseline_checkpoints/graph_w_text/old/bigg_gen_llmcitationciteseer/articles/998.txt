Virtual reality (VR) systems increasingly rely on gesture recognition to enable immersive interactions. However, users' performance and experience can be hindered by the lack of visual feedback on their gestures. This paper investigates the effects of visual feedback on gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction in VR. We designed a study with 30 participants, who performed a series of gestures with and without visual feedback. Our results show that visual feedback significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and reduces user frustration. We also identify specific design recommendations for visual feedback in VR gesture recognition systems.
