E-commerce search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant products from massive catalogs. This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HNRM', which leverages both semantic and structural features of product data. HNRM employs a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy, where a semantic-aware neural network filters out irrelevant products, followed by a ranking module that refines the results using a hierarchical attention mechanism. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HNRM achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
