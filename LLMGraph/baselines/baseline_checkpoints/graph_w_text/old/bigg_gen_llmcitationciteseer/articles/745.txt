Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing query execution plans in DDS remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design a RL-based framework, 'QueryOptRL', that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment. QueryOptRL leverages a novel reward function that balances query execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrate that QueryOptRL outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource efficiency.
