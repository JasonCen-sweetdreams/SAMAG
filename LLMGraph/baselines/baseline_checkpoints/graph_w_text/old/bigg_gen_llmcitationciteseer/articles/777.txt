Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, GraphPE, which leverages graph-based keyword embeddings to better represent query semantics. By modeling keyword relationships as a graph and incorporating node2vec-based embeddings, GraphPE can effectively identify relevant expansion terms and improve retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
