Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data management, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust query execution plans in response to changing workload and system conditions. Our method, called 'RL-QEP', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query optimization, outperforming traditional rule-based and cost-based optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and system throughput.
