As augmented reality (AR) technology advances, gaze-based interfaces have gained popularity for their potential to enhance user experience. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art eye-tracking algorithms for AR systems. We analyze the accuracy, latency, and robustness of these algorithms under various conditions, including different lighting scenarios and user demographics. Our results show that the novel 'EyeLink' algorithm outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and latency, while maintaining robustness in diverse environments. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of gaze-based interfaces in AR systems.
