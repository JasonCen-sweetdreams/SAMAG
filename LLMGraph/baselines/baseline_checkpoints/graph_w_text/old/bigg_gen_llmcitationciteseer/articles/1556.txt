Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources to satisfy diverse user demands. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'CloudOptimizer', to optimize resource allocation in cloud computing. CloudOptimizer utilizes a hybrid DRL architecture, combining the advantages of both model-based and model-free reinforcement learning, to learn an optimal resource allocation strategy. Experimental results on a real-world cloud computing dataset demonstrate that CloudOptimizer achieves significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
