Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and trustworthy suggestions to users. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that incorporates both user and item relationships to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex dependencies between users and items, and a hierarchical structure to model multi-level item relationships. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
