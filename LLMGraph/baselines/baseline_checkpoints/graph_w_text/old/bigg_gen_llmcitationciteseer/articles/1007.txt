As data volumes and velocities continue to increase, traditional disk-based database systems struggle to meet the performance demands of real-time data analytics. This paper presents 'IMDB-X', a novel in-memory database system designed specifically for high-performance, low-latency analytics workloads. IMDB-X leverages a hybrid storage architecture, combining column-store and row-store formats, to achieve optimal query performance and data compression. Our experimental evaluation on a 100-node cluster demonstrates IMDB-X's ability to handle massive datasets, achieving up to 10x faster query response times compared to state-of-the-art disk-based systems.
