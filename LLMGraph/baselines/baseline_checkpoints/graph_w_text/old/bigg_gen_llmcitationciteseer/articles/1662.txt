Materialized views are a crucial optimization technique in database systems, but their maintenance becomes increasingly complex in distributed settings. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DynaView', that leverages incremental view maintenance and adaptive sampling to reduce the overhead of materialized view updates in distributed databases. DynaView uses a probabilistic model to predict the impact of updates on the materialized view and selectively refreshes the view based on the predicted error bounds. Our experiments on a distributed relational database demonstrate that DynaView achieves significant performance gains and improved freshness compared to traditional materialized view maintenance techniques.
