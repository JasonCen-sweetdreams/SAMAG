Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly improve the recall of relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep learning-based semantic embeddings. We leverage pre-trained language models to generate dense vector representations of query terms and documents, and then employ a graph-based method to expand the query with semantically related terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing computational overhead.
