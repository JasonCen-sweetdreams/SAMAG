This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation policies. Our approach, dubbed 'AgentGNN', represents agents and tasks as nodes in a graph, and utilizes GNNs to capture complex dependencies between agents and tasks. AgentGNN learns to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, availability, and communication constraints, outperforming traditional optimization-based methods in simulations. We evaluate AgentGNN on a variety of scenarios, demonstrating its scalability, flexibility, and robustness in dynamic environments.
