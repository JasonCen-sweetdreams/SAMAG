In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach, called 'DecTAG', leverages the structural properties of the agent communication graph to learn task allocation policies that maximize system efficiency and fairness. We introduce a novel GNN architecture that incorporates agent-specific features and task requirements, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulated and real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that DecTAG outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
