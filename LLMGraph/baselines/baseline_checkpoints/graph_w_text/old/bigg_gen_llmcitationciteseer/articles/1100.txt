The proliferation of high-dimensional data has rendered traditional indexing techniques ineffective. We propose a novel indexing approach, 'LBC-Index', which leverages learned bitmap compression to efficiently store and query high-dimensional data. By learning a compact representation of the data distribution, LBC-Index reduces storage costs and improves query performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of LBC-Index on real-world datasets, achieving up to 5x faster query times and 3x better storage compression compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods.
