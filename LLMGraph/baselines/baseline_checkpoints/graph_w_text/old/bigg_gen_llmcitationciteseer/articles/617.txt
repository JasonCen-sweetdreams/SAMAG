Resource Description Framework (RDF) graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale semantic data. However, optimizing query execution plans for RDF queries remains a complex task, especially in the presence of large datasets and complex queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate query optimization as a Markov decision process and train an RL agent to learn an optimal policy for selecting the most efficient query plans. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
