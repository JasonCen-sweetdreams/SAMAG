Time series anomaly detection is crucial in various applications, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies and provides explainable insights into the decision-making process. Our HAN model incorporates a multi-scale attention mechanism that focuses on relevant time series segments and features, allowing for effective anomaly detection and identification of root causes. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies and providing interpretable explanations.
