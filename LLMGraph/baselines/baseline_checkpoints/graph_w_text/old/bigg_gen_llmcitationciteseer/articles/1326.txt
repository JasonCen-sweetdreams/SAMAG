Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a query. Traditional methods rely on keyword-based query expansion, which can be limited by the vocabulary gap between the query and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphEmbExpand', which exploits graph-based embeddings to capture contextual relationships between entities and expand the query. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphEmbExpand on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art methods.
