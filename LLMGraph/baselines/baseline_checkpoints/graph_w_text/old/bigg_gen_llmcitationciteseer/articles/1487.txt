Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. However, most existing ERS models rely on simple user-item interaction graphs, failing to capture complex relationships between entities. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention (HGA) framework, which models user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph, incorporating both local and global contextual information. HGA leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges, providing interpretable explanations for recommended items. Our experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that HGA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ERS models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
