Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study involving 120 participants, who interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a VR game. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly improved user engagement, with participants reporting higher levels of enjoyment, presence, and self-identification. We also found that personalized avatars reduced user frustration and improved overall system usability. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems and highlight the importance of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience.
