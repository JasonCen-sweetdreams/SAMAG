Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. This paper proposes a novel, stealthy node injection attack method, 'NodeSneak', which can deceive GNNs by injecting carefully crafted nodes into the graph. We demonstrate that NodeSneak can successfully mislead GNNs, even when the graph structure is partially known. Our experiments on popular graph benchmarks show that NodeSneak outperforms existing attack methods, emphasizing the need for robustness measures against such attacks in GNN-based systems.
