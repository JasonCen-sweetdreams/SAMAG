Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our HAN framework consists of two attention layers: a temporal attention layer that captures long-term dependencies and a feature attention layer that identifies important features contributing to the anomaly score. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating improved detection performance and providing visual explanations for anomaly detection.
