The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion in time-series data generation, necessitating efficient real-time analytics. This paper presents 'Chrono', a novel query optimization framework that leverages temporal and spatial correlations in IoT data to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Chrono employs a hybrid indexing strategy, combining B+-trees with bitap compression, to accelerate range queries and aggregation operations. Experimental evaluation on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrates that Chrono outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3.5x, while reducing energy consumption by 25%.
