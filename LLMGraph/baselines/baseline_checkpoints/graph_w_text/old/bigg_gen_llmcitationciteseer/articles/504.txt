Open-domain question answering (ODQA) typically involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus and then extracting the answer. Existing dense retrieval methods are computationally expensive and often fail to capture the hierarchical structure of the passage content. We propose a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach that leverages a combination of coarse-grained and fine-grained dense representations to efficiently retrieve passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer computations.
