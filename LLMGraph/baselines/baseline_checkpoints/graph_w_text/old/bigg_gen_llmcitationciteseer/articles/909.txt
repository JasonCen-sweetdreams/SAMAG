Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships. However, optimizing graph queries remains a challenging task, especially for large-scale datasets. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GLIO', which leverages learned index structures to accelerate graph query execution. By training a neural network to predict the optimal query plan, GLIO achieves significant performance improvements over traditional query optimization techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GLIO on several real-world graph datasets, including social networks and knowledge graphs.
