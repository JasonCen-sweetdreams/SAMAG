While recommendation systems have achieved impressive performance with graph-based methods, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that incorporates both node- and graph-level attention mechanisms to provide explainable recommendations. By jointly learning node representations and graph structures, HGAT captures complex user-item relationships and identifies influential nodes. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both recommendation accuracy and explainability, providing valuable insights for users and developers alike.
