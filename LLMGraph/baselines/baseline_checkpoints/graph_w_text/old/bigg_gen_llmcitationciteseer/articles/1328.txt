This paper proposes a novel hybrid multi-agent framework for efficient resource allocation in cloud computing environments. Our approach combines the strengths of both centralized and decentralized allocation strategies, leveraging the benefits of autonomous decision-making agents and a centralized coordinator. We design a multi-objective optimization problem to minimize response time, energy consumption, and cost, while satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) constraints. Experimental results on a real-world cloud computing dataset demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization and QoS satisfaction compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
