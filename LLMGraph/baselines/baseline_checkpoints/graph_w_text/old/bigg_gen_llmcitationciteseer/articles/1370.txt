The proliferation of voice-based interfaces has led to a growing interest in personalization techniques that adapt to individual users' preferences and behaviors. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effects of personalization on user experience in voice-based interfaces. We conducted a series of user studies to investigate the impact of personalized response generation, acoustic modeling, and dialogue management on user satisfaction, engagement, and perceived system intelligence. Our results show that personalization can significantly improve user experience, but its effectiveness is highly dependent on the type of task, user demographics, and the level of personalization granularity.
