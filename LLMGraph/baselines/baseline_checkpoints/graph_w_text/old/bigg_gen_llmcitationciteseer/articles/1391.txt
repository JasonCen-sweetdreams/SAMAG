Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to detect anomalies in time series data. Our approach allows for explaining the anomaly detection process by visualizing the attention weights and identifying the most relevant features. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while providing interpretable results.
