Explainable recommendation systems (XRS) have gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing methods often rely on simplistic interaction modeling or linear aggregation of user and item features. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT) to model complex relationships between users, items, and their attributes. HGAT leverages a hierarchical graph structure to capture multi-scale interactions and incorporate attention mechanisms to highlight influential features. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art XRS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explainability.
