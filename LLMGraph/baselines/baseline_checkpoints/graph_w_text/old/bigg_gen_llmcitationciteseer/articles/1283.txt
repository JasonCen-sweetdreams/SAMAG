Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient retrieval of relevant passages from a massive corpus. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense representation (HDR) framework for passage retrieval, which leverages both local and global semantic context. Our approach uses a hierarchical transformer encoder to learn dense representations at multiple granularities, enabling more effective pruning and filtering of irrelevant passages. Experimental results on the SQuAD dataset demonstrate that HDR achieves state-of-the-art passage retrieval performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30% compared to existing dense retrieval methods.
