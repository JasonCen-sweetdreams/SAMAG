Proximity search is a fundamental operation in various applications, including computer vision, recommendation systems, and data mining. However, the curse of dimensionality renders traditional indexing techniques inefficient in high-dimensional spaces. This paper presents a novel indexing scheme, 'HD-Prox', which leverages the concept of hierarchical dense representations to prune the search space. We propose a novel distance metric, 'HD-Metric', that captures the intrinsic structure of high-dimensional data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HD-Prox outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of query efficiency and accuracy.
