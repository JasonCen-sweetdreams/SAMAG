In this paper, we address the challenging problem of decentralized task allocation for multi-agent systems. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn task allocation policies in a distributed manner. Our framework, called 'DRL-TA', utilizes a decentralized actor-critic architecture to facilitate communication and coordination among agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DRL-TA through extensive simulations, showing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized and distributed approaches.
