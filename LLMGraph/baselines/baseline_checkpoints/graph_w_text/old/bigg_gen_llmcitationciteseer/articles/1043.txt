Traditional query expansion techniques rely on manual feature engineering and heuristics, leading to suboptimal performance in ad-hoc retrieval tasks. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepQERL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to automatically learn optimal query expansion strategies. By formulating query expansion as a Markov decision process, we can efficiently explore the vast space of possible expansions and identify effective ones. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DeepQERL over state-of-the-art methods, with significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
