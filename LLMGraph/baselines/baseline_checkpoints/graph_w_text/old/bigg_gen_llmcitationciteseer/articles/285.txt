Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a given question. Existing dense retrieval methods are computationally expensive and memory-intensive, making them challenging to deploy in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel sparse indexing approach, dubbed 'SparsePassage', which reduces the storage requirements and accelerates passage retrieval without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce a hierarchical clustering-based indexing scheme that prunes irrelevant passages and leverages sparse matrix operations for efficient similarity computation. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that SparsePassage achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
