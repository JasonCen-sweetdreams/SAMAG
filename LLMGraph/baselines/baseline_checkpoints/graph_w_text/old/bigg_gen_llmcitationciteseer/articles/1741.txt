With the increasing adoption of RDF data models in various applications, optimizing query performance in distributed RDF databases has become a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to select the optimal query execution plan based on the database's current state and the query's characteristics. Our experiments on a real-world RDF dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x in query execution time.
