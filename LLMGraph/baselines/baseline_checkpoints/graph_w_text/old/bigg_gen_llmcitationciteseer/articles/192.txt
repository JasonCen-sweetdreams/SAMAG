In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized approach using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. We model the agent-task graph as a heterogeneous graph, where agents and tasks are represented as nodes, and edges denote the suitability of agents for tasks. Our GCN-based framework, 'AgentAlloc', learns node representations that capture the complex relationships between agents and tasks, enabling decentralized task allocation without relying on a centralized controller. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that AgentAlloc outperforms traditional distributed allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
