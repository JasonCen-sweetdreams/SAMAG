Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR), particularly when dealing with short and ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to capture semantic relationships between query terms and candidate expansion terms. Our model employs a multi-task learning framework, jointly optimizing query-term similarity and relevance ranking tasks. Experiments on several TREC benchmarks demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
