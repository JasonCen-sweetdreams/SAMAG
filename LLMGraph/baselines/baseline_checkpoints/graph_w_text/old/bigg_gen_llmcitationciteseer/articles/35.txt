Distributed databases face significant challenges in maintaining data consistency and ensuring low-latency query processing. This paper presents a novel data replication strategy, 'Echo', which leverages a combination of caching, logging, and asynchronous replication to achieve real-time query performance. We demonstrate that Echo outperforms existing replication schemes in terms of throughput and latency, while ensuring strong consistency guarantees. Our experiments on a large-scale dataset show that Echo can support up to 10,000 concurrent queries per second, making it suitable for demanding applications such as real-time analytics and IoT data processing.
