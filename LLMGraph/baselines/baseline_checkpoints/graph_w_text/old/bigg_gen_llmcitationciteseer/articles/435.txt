Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered study on designing inclusive conversational interfaces for this demographic. We conducted interviews and usability testing with 20 older adults to identify key challenges and preferences. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise language, minimal cognitive load, and personalized feedback. We propose a set of design guidelines and a novel conversational flow model that accommodates older adults' communication styles. A prototype implementation demonstrates significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates.
