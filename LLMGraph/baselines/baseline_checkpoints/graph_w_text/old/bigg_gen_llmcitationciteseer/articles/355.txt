Efficient task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, particularly in complex and dynamic environments. We propose a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn effective allocation policies. Our approach, called 'Dec-TARL', uses a multi-agent deep Q-network to learn the optimal task allocation strategy, considering the agents' capabilities, task requirements, and environmental constraints. We evaluate Dec-TARL in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
