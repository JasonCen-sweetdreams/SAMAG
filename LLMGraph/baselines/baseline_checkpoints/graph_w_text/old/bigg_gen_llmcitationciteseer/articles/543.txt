Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, as it can significantly impact the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach for query expansion, which learns to predict the relevance of expansion terms based on their semantic relationships with the original query terms. Our model, dubbed 'DeepQE', utilizes a combination of word embeddings and convolutional neural networks to capture the contextual information in the query and documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
