Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to enrich the original query with relevant terms to improve retrieval performance. However, existing QE methods often rely on simplistic term weighting schemes or static semantic representations, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel attention-based QE approach, dubbed AttentiveQE, which leverages contextualized semantic embeddings to model the complex relationships between query terms and document content. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that AttentiveQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and robustness.
