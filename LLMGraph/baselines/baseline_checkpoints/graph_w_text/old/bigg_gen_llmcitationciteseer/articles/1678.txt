Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-structured data, where a model must generalize to new classes with limited labeled examples. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant subgraphs and nodes. HGAT consists of a hierarchical graph encoder, which aggregates node features and structural information, and a few-shot learner, which adapts to new classes via meta-learning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.
