Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their usability and accessibility remain a concern for older adults. This study investigates the design of conversational strategies that facilitate more effective and empowering interactions between older adults and voice assistants. We conducted a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with 30 participants aged 65+, exploring the impact of different dialogue patterns, turn-taking mechanisms, and error handling approaches on user experience and task completion rates. Our findings highlight the importance of adopting a more empathetic, incremental, and explicit communication style, which can significantly improve the usability and trustworthiness of voice assistants for older adults.
