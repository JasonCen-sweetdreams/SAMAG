Collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems often struggle with scalability and cold-start problems. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that leverages graph neural networks to learn item and user representations. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture complex relationships between items and users, enabling efficient and effective recommendation generation. Experimental results on large-scale datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency.
