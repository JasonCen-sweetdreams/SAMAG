The increasing complexity of IoT networks necessitates efficient resource allocation to ensure seamless operation. This paper presents a decentralized autonomous agent-based framework, 'DAARA', which enables adaptive resource allocation in IoT networks. DAARA leverages a multi-agent system, where each agent represents a device, to negotiate and allocate resources based on real-time demand and supply. We introduce a novel auction-based mechanism that considers device heterogeneity, latency, and energy constraints, resulting in improved resource utilization and reduced network congestion. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate the effectiveness of DAARA in achieving efficient resource allocation and improved network performance.
