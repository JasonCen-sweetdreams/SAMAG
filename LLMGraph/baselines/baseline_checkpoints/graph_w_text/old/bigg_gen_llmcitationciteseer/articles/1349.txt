The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors has led to an explosion of time-series data, posing significant challenges for efficient querying and indexing. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, HiBF, which leverages hierarchical Bloom filters to accelerate range queries and nearest-neighbor searches on time-series data. We demonstrate that HiBF outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, such as B+-trees and trie-based indexes, in terms of query latency and storage efficiency. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that HiBF achieves up to 5x speedup and 3x storage reduction compared to existing methods.
