Distributed column-store databases are increasingly popular in big data analytics, but query optimization remains a major bottleneck. This paper presents 'ColOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages statistical modeling and machine learning to reduce query latency. ColOpt uses a hybrid approach, combining traditional rule-based optimization with a neural network-based cost model. We evaluate ColOpt on a real-world dataset and show significant improvements in query performance, with an average speedup of 3.2x compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
