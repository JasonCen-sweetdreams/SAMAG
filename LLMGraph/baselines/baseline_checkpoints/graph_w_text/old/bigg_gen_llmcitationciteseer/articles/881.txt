Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing database queries in such systems remains a complex task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select efficient query plans based on the system's workload, data distribution, and resource availability. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x on complex queries.
