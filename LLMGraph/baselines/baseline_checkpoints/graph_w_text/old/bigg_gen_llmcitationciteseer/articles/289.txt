Few-shot learning has become increasingly important in real-world applications where labeled data is scarce. However, existing approaches often rely on complex meta-learning frameworks or require large amounts of unlabeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that can effectively learn from limited labeled data. Our HAN model leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant features and samples, enabling it to adapt to new classes with only a few examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-shot learning scenarios.
