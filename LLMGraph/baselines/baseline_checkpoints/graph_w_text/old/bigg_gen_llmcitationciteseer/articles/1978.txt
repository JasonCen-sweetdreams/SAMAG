Multi-tenancy in cloud-based database systems poses significant query optimization challenges. Existing approaches either compromise on performance or require extensive manual tuning. This paper presents 'QTune', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and graph-based models to efficiently identify optimal query plans for diverse workloads. Our evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that QTune achieves an average of 30% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
