Coordinating multiple agents to achieve a common goal is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that facilitates explainable multi-agent cooperation. Our approach enables agents to selectively focus on relevant teammates and communicate their intentions through attention weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a variety of cooperative scenarios, including robotic soccer and disaster response. Experimental results show that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art cooperative methods while providing transparent and interpretable decision-making processes.
