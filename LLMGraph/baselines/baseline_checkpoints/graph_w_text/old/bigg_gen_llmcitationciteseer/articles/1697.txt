Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly popular, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice-based interface tailored to this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our proposed interface incorporates adaptive feedback mechanisms, personalized vocabulary, and error tolerance to accommodate cognitive limitations. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice-based interfaces.
