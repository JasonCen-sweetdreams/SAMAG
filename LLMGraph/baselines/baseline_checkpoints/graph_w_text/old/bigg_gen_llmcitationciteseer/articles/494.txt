In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and effective solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We formulate the task allocation problem as a DCOP and develop a novel algorithm, called DCA-MA, that enables agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark problems demonstrate that DCA-MA outperforms existing centralized approaches in terms of solution quality and scalability. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the algorithm's convergence properties and communication complexity.
