Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis, but existing methods struggle with scalability and robustness. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepHC', which leverages density-based deep embeddings to efficiently cluster high-dimensional data. By learning a hierarchical representation of the data through a stacked denoising autoencoder, DeepHC can identify clusters at multiple scales and handle varying densities. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepHC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency.
