Node classification on graphs is a fundamental problem in many domains, but traditional methods struggle with inductive learning, where the model must generalize to unseen nodes. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical graph representations to capture complex node relationships. HGAT combines node-level attention with graph-level attention to learn robust node features, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets for inductive node classification.
