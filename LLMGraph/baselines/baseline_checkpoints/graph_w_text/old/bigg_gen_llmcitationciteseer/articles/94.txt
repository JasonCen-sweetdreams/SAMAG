We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for urban traffic control, where each agent corresponds to a traffic signal. Our approach, dubbed 'TrafficMA', leverages Graph Attention Networks to model the complex interactions between agents and incorporates a novel reward function that balances traffic flow and fairness. Experiments on a realistic traffic simulation platform demonstrate that TrafficMA outperforms traditional, centralized methods in reducing congestion and travel times, while also improving scalability and adaptability to changing traffic patterns.
