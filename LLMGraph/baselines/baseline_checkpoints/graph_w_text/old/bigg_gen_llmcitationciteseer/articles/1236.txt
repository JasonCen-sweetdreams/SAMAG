Explainable AI (XAI) has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in recommendation systems where model interpretability is crucial. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that incorporates XAI principles to provide personalized recommendations. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model complex user-item interactions and attention mechanisms to highlight influential features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN on two real-world datasets, showing improved performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our results have significant implications for the development of trustworthy AI-driven recommendation systems.
