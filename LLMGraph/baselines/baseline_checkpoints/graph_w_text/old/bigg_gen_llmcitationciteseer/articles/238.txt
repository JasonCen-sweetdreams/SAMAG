Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. Existing methods often struggle with complex temporal dependencies and non-linear relationships between variables. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphTSAD', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the complex structure of multivariate time series data. We introduce a graph-based anomaly scoring mechanism that captures both local and global patterns in the data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphTSAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to noise.
