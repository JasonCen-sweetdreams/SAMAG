Voice assistants have the potential to support older adults' independence and well-being, but their design often neglects the needs of this demographic. This paper presents a participatory co-design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a series of workshops and interviews with 25 older adults to identify their values, preferences, and pain points when interacting with voice assistants. Our findings highlight the importance of designing for cognitive accessibility, social connection, and emotional support. We propose a set of design principles and guidelines for creating more inclusive voice assistants, demonstrated through a prototype that incorporates these principles.
