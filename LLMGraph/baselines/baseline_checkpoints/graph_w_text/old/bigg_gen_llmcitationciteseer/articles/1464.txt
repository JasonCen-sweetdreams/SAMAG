In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL). Our approach, called Dec-TARL, leverages a decentralized actor-critic architecture to enable agents to learn task allocation strategies in a distributed manner. We evaluate Dec-TARL in a simulated robotics environment and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing task requirements and agent capabilities, outperforming traditional centralized task allocation methods.
