This paper presents a novel autonomous agent-based surveillance system for intelligent traffic management. Our system, dubbed 'TrafficGuard', leverages a swarm of mobile agents to monitor and analyze traffic patterns in real-time. Each agent is equipped with computer vision and machine learning capabilities to detect anomalies, predict traffic congestion, and provide personalized routing recommendations to drivers. We demonstrate the efficacy of TrafficGuard through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, showcasing its ability to reduce traffic congestion by up to 30% and decrease travel times by an average of 15 minutes.
