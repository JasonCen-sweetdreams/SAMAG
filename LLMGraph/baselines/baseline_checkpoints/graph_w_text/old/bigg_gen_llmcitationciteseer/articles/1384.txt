Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, aiming to refine user queries to better match relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'CogEmb', which leverages word embeddings and cognitive graphs to capture semantic relationships between query terms. We develop a graph-based framework that integrates Word2Vec embeddings with cognitive principles to identify meaningful term expansions. Experimental results on the TREC dataset demonstrate that CogEmb significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
