Emotion recognition from multimodal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features to improve emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention modules and a hierarchical fusion mechanism, enabling it to capture both local and global patterns in multimodal data. Experimental results on the CMU-Multimodal SDK dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multimodal inputs, with an average F1-score improvement of 7.2%.
