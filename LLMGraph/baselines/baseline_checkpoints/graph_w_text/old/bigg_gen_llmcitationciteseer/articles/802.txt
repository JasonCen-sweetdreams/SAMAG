Distributed database systems face the challenge of optimizing query execution plans to minimize response times and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans based on runtime feedback. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict optimal join orders and indexing strategies for various query workloads. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 3x faster query execution times and 2x better resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
