Virtual assistants (VAs) are increasingly being designed with human-like features to enhance user engagement. However, the impact of anthropomorphic embodiment on user trust remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining how VA embodiment affects user trust in various tasks, including financial transactions and personal data sharing. Our results show that users perceive anthropomorphized VAs as more trustworthy, but only when the VA's embodiment is subtle and context-dependent. We discuss implications for VA design and provide guidelines for creating trustworthy VAs that balance anthropomorphism with user autonomy.
