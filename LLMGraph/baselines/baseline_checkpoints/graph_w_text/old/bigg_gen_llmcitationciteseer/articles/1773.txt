Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on simplistic term weighting and matching techniques. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep contextualized embeddings to enrich query representations. We propose a multi-layer Transformer-based architecture that captures nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
