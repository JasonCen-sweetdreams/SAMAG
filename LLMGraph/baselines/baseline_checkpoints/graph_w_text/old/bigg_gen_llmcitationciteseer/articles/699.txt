Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems is a complex task due to the inherent complexity of graph data and the need to balance query latency with system throughput. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to select efficient query plans based on feedback from the database. We design a Markov decision process model that captures the query optimization problem and develop a deep Q-network-based solution that outperforms traditional optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate improved query performance and reduced latency.
