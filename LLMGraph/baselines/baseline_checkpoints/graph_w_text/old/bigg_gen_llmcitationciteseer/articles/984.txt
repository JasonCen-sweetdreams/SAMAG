In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized deep reinforcement learning framework for task allocation, where each agent learns to optimize its own task selection policy based on local observations. We introduce a novel attention-based neural network architecture that enables agents to reason about task dependencies and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utility.
