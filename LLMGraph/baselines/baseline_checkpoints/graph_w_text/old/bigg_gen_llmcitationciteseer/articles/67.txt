Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in many households, but their usability and accessibility remain a significant concern for older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of user studies and interviews to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed system, 'EasyVoice', incorporates adaptive speech recognition, simplified vocabulary, and personalized feedback mechanisms to facilitate more effective and enjoyable interactions. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
