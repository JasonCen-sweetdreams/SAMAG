Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important in various applications, such as financial analysis and IoT monitoring. However, optimizing queries in these systems is a challenging task due to the high volume and velocity of data. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using machine learning techniques. We propose a framework that leverages query workload patterns and data distribution characteristics to predict optimal query execution plans. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization methods, achieving an average reduction of 30% in query response time and 25% in resource utilization.
