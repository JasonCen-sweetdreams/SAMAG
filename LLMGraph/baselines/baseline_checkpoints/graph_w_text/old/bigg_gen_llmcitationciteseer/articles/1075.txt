Trust is a crucial component in multi-agent systems, where agents rely on each other to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a novel trust model, SocNorm, which incorporates social norms to improve trust estimation and decision-making. SocNorm integrates reputation-based trust with social norms, such as reciprocity and fairness, to capture the dynamic nature of trust in multi-agent interactions. Experimental results on a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate that SocNorm outperforms traditional trust models in terms of trust accuracy and system performance.
