Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in Information Retrieval (IR) that involves retrieving relevant documents for a given query. However, the query's limited context often leads to poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. DeepQE utilizes a transformer-based architecture to capture contextual relationships between query terms and generates a weighted set of expanded terms. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision.
