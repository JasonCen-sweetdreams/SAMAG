This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. Our approach, called GNN-TA, represents the agent interaction graph as a learnable structure, enabling the agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-TA in a simulated disaster response scenario, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
