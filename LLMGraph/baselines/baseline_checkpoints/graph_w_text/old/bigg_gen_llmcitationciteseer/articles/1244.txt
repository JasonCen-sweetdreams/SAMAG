Distributed databases are increasingly used to store and process large amounts of data. However, optimizing query processing in these systems is a complex task due to the dynamic nature of the environment. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize query processing in distributed databases. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize query plans based on the system's current state and workload. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques and reduces query execution time by up to 30%.
