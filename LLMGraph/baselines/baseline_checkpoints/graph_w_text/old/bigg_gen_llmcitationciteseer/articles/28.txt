Coalition formation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to form teams to accomplish complex tasks. Existing solutions often rely on heuristics or centralized optimization, which can be computationally expensive and lack scalability. We propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a distributed coalition formation algorithm. Our method, called Graph Coalition Formation (GCF), represents the agent interaction graph as a neural network and trains it to predict optimal coalitions. Experimental results on various benchmark scenarios demonstrate that GCF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
