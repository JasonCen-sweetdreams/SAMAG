This paper addresses the problem of efficient resource allocation in complex systems comprising multiple autonomous agents. We propose a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to coordinate agent actions and optimize resource utilization. Our approach, called MARL-RA, integrates a decentralized actor-critic architecture with a graph neural network to learn effective resource allocation strategies. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate that MARL-RA outperforms traditional optimization methods and decentralized heuristics in terms of resource efficiency, scalability, and adaptability to changing system conditions.
