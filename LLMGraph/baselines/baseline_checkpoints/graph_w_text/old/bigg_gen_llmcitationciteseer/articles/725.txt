Decentralized task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents need to negotiate and allocate tasks to achieve a common goal. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework, 'AdaptNegotiate', which leverages adaptive negotiation strategies to improve task allocation efficiency and fairness. Our framework integrates a distributed constraint optimization algorithm with a reinforcement learning-based negotiation mechanism, enabling agents to adapt to changing system dynamics and task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated multi-agent system demonstrate that AdaptNegotiate outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent satisfaction.
