Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing intuitive interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in VR, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, analyzing their gestures and cognitive load while performing tasks in a VR environment. Our results show that incorporating embodied cognition principles, such as gesture-based manipulation and spatial awareness, can significantly improve user experience and performance. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR interfaces and their potential applications in fields like education and healthcare.
