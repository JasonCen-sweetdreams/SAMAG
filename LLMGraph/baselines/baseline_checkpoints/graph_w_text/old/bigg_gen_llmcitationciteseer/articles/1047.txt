Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in search systems, as it resolves ambiguity in user queries by identifying the intended entity. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding approach for entity-disambiguated search, which leverages the semantic relationships between entities to improve query expansion. Our method, called GraphEE, represents entities as nodes in a graph and learns vector representations that capture their contextual relationships. We evaluate GraphEE on a large-scale dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in search accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
