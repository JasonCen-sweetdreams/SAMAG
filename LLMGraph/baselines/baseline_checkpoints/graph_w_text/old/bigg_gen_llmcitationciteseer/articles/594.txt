Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate query optimization as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query plan selection. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
