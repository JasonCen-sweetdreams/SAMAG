Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their accessibility for visually impaired users remains a significant concern. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to create accessible conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. We conducted user studies to identify the key challenges and preferences of this user group, and developed a set of design guidelines for accessible conversational interfaces. We also propose a novel speech-based interface, 'TalkBack', which incorporates these guidelines and provides real-time feedback to users. Our evaluation results show that TalkBack significantly improves the interaction experience for visually impaired users, demonstrating the potential for more inclusive conversational interfaces.
