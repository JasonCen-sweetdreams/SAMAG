Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on simplistic term weighting schemes or manual feature engineering. This paper presents a novel approach, 'NeuQE', which leverages deep neural ranking models to learn context-aware term importance. We propose a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both local and global dependencies between query terms and document contents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 12.3% increase in mean average precision.
