Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explanations for the detected outliers. Our approach leverages multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms to identify relevant segments and features contributing to anomalies. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of explainability.
