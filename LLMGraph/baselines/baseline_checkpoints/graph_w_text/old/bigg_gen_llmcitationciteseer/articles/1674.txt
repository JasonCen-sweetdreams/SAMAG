Virtual assistants (VAs) are increasingly prevalent in everyday life, but their effectiveness relies heavily on user engagement. This study investigates the role of anthropomorphic feedback in enhancing user experience and motivation. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 120 participants, comparing the effects of human-like feedback (e.g., emotional expressions, personalized comments) versus traditional, functional feedback on user satisfaction, task completion rates, and self-reported motivation. Our results show that anthropomorphic feedback significantly boosts user engagement, particularly among younger users and those with lower prior experience with VAs. We discuss implications for VA design and future research directions.
