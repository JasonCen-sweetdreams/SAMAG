Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, 'RL-QO', leverages a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given workload. We evaluate RL-QO on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques. Furthermore, we show that RL-QO can adapt to changing workloads and database schemas, making it a promising solution for large-scale distributed database systems.
