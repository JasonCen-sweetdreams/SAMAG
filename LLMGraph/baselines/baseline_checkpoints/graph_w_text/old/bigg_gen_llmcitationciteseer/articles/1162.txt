Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph-based models. We represent the database schema and query plan as a graph, enabling the application of graph neural networks to learn efficient query execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
