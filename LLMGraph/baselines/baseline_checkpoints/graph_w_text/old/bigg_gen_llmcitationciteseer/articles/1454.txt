Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in complex decision-making tasks, but the lack of transparency in its decision-making process hinders its wider adoption. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention framework, 'HierAttn', to facilitate explainable RL. HierAttn incorporates multi-level attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant state features and actions, allowing for better understanding of the decision-making process. We demonstrate the efficacy of HierAttn on a range of Atari games, showcasing improved interpretability and performance over existing state-of-the-art methods.
