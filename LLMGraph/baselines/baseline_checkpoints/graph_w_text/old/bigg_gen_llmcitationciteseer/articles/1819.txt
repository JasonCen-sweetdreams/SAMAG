Multi-modal recommendation systems leverage diverse user interactions, such as ratings, reviews, and clicks, to provide personalized experiences. However, existing methods often fail to capture complex relationships between modalities. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that models interactions as a graph, incorporating node- and edge-level attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on three real-world datasets, achieving significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods.
