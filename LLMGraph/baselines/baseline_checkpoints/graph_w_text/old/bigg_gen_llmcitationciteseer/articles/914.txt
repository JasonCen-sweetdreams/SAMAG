Recent advances in graph neural networks have led to significant improvements in recommendation system performance. However, the lack of interpretability in these models hinders their widespread adoption. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages graph attention mechanisms to learn hierarchical representations of users and items. We demonstrate that HGAT not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets but also provides interpretable recommendations by identifying influential nodes in the user-item graph. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, Graph-based Relevance Explanation (GRE), to quantify the interpretability of recommendation models.
