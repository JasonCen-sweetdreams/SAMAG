Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-based machine learning, where a model must generalize to unseen classes with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both node-level and graph-level attention mechanisms to learn robust representations. Our approach adaptively selects relevant nodes and subgraphs to focus on during training, resulting in improved performance and robustness to label noise. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in few-shot node classification scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
