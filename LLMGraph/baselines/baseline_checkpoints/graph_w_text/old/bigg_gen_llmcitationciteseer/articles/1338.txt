Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, called GraphOpt, which efficiently optimizes queries in distributed database systems. GraphOpt constructs a graph representation of the query plan and leverages graph algorithms to identify optimal execution paths. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
