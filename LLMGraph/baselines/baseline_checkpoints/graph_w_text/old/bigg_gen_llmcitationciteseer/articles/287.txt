This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in virtual reality (VR) environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized or non-personalized avatar condition. Results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and self-reported engagement, as well as improved task performance. We also analyzed the role of avatar customizability and user embodiment in mediating these effects. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems and highlight the potential benefits of incorporating personalized avatars in various applications, including education, entertainment, and therapy.
