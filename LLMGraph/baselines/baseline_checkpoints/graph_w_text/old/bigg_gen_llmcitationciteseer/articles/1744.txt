Neural information retrieval (NIR) models have shown impressive performance in various retrieval tasks, but their computational complexity hinders their scalability. This paper introduces a novel document indexing scheme, 'NeuroIndex', which leverages the inherent structure of neural networks to accelerate document retrieval. By learning a compact, hierarchical representation of the document collection, NeuroIndex reduces the number of required neural network evaluations, resulting in significant speedups and improved scalability. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuroIndex in facilitating efficient NIR, making it a promising solution for large-scale information retrieval applications.
