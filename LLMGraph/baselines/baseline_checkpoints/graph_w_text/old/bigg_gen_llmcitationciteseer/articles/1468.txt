Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, such as finance and healthcare. However, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper introduces HATS, a novel hierarchical attention network that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights. HATS leverages multi-scale attention mechanisms to identify relevant temporal patterns and contextual features, enabling the identification of anomalies at different granularities. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HATS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides meaningful insights into anomaly explanations.
