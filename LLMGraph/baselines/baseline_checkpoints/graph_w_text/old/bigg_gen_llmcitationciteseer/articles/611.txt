Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
