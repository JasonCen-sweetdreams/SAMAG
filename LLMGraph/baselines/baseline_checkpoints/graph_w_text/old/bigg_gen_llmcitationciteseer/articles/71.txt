Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but existing VR interfaces often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR interfaces that cater to users with varying levels of visual impairment. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with visually impaired participants, resulting in the development of a novel VR interface that leverages auditory and haptic feedback. Our user study demonstrates that the proposed interface significantly improves navigation and interaction performance for visually impaired users, while also providing an enhanced overall VR experience.
