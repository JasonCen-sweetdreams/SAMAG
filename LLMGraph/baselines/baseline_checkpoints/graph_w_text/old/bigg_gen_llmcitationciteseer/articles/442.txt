This paper presents a novel approach to real-time traffic management using autonomous agents coordinated by deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'SmartTraffic', where agents learn to optimize traffic signal control in a dynamic, multi-intersection environment. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model complex traffic patterns and multi-agent Q-learning to optimize signal timing. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional traffic management strategies.
