This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in multi-agent systems, where a set of agents with varying capabilities need to be assigned to a set of tasks with diverse requirements. We propose a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn effective allocation policies. Our approach utilizes graph neural networks to model agent-task interactions and incorporates a novel attention mechanism to focus on relevant task features. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
