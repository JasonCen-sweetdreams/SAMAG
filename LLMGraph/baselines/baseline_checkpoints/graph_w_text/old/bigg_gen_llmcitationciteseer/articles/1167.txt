Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query execution plans for these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of graph data and the distributed nature of the system. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for generating query execution plans. Our experimental results on a distributed graph database demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional query optimization techniques.
