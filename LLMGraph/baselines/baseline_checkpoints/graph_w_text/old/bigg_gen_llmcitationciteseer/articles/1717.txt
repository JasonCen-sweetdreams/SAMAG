Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it significantly affects the performance and scalability of the system. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and use deep reinforcement learning to learn an optimal policy for query optimization. Our approach, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a combination of exploration and exploitation to adapt to changing database workloads and optimize query execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
