Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has shown promising results in various information retrieval tasks. However, existing DPR models suffer from high computational costs and large memory requirements. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document embedding (QADE) approach that dynamically adjusts the document representation based on the query context. Our method leverages a lightweight neural network to learn query-dependent document embeddings, enabling efficient top-K retrieval with minimal computational overhead. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QADE achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art DPR models.
