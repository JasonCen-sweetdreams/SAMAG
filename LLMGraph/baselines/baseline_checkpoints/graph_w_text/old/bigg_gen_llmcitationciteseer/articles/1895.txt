Neural retrieval models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in document ranking tasks, but their computational requirements and memory usage hinder their adoption in real-world applications. This paper presents 'NeuroIndex', a novel indexing framework that accelerates neural retrieval models by up to 5x while maintaining retrieval effectiveness. NeuroIndex leverages a hierarchical clustering approach to group documents based on their semantic similarity, enabling efficient pruning of the search space and reducing the number of neural network evaluations required. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that NeuroIndex achieves significant speedups without sacrificing ranking quality.
