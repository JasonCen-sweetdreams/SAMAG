As multi-agent systems grow in scale and complexity, decentralized decision-making becomes increasingly important. This paper presents a novel clustering algorithm, DACS, designed for decentralized agent systems. DACS leverages a distributed, self-organizing approach to group agents into clusters based on their semantic roles and goals. Our experiments demonstrate DACS' ability to achieve near-optimal clustering performance with reduced communication overhead compared to centralized clustering methods. We also explore the impact of DACS on system scalability, fault tolerance, and adaptability in various application domains.
