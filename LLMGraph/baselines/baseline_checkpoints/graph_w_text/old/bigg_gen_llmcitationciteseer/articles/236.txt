In multi-agent systems, effective resource allocation is crucial for achieving system-wide objectives. This paper presents a decentralized negotiation framework, called 'NegoMAS', which enables autonomous agents to negotiate and allocate resources in a distributed manner. NegoMAS leverages a novel combination of auction-based mechanisms and argumentation-based negotiation strategies to facilitate efficient resource allocation. We evaluate NegoMAS in a simulated smart grid environment and demonstrate its ability to achieve near-optimal resource allocation while minimizing communication overhead.
