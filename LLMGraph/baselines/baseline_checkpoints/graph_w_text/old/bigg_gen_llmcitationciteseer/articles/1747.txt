Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it significantly impacts the performance and scalability of modern data-intensive applications. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-QOpt', which leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select the most efficient execution plans for complex queries. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
