Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents an exploratory study on designing inclusive VR experiences for visually impaired individuals. We propose a novel framework, 'VIrtual Accessibility', which integrates audio-based navigation, haptic feedback, and personalized assistance to facilitate independent exploration of VR environments. Our user study with 20 visually impaired participants demonstrates significant improvements in engagement, navigation, and overall VR experience compared to traditional visual-centric designs.
