Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in daily life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This study examines age-related differences in speech patterns when interacting with voice assistants. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 100 participants, aged 25-85, using a custom-built voice assistant. Our results show that older adults exhibit distinct speech patterns, including slower speech rates, more pauses, and increased hesitations. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants, incorporating age-adaptive speech recognition, simplified dialogue flows, and targeted feedback mechanisms. Our findings have implications for the development of accessible and user-centered voice interfaces.
