This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the role of gesture-based interaction in shaping users' cognitive processes. We designed a VR experiment where participants performed a series of cognitive tasks using either gesture-based or controller-based interfaces. Our results show that gesture-based interaction leads to significant improvements in spatial reasoning and working memory, suggesting that embodied cognition plays a crucial role in VR-based cognitive processing. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more effective and engaging VR interfaces.
