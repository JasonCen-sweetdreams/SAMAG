Proactive virtual assistants can significantly enhance user experience, but require accurate intention recognition. This paper proposes a novel gaze-based intention recognition framework, which leverages deep learning models to analyze user gaze patterns. Our approach integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) for gaze feature extraction and a recurrent neural network (RNN) for intention prediction. We evaluate our framework using a large-scale dataset of gaze patterns and demonstrate an improvement of 22% in intention recognition accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
