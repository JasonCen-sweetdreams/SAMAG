Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a widely used technique to improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep neural networks. We leverage a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn a semantic representation of the query and documents. Our approach, called DeepQE, outperforms traditional query expansion methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. We also provide an extensive analysis of the learned representations and their impact on retrieval performance.
