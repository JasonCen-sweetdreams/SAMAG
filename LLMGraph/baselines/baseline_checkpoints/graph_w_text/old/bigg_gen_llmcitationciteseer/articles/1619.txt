Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to achieve a common goal. We propose a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach, called 'DRL-TA', uses a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn the optimal task allocation policy. Experimental results on a realistic logistics scenario demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to changing environments.
