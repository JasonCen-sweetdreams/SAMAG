Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization in DDS, which models the database schema as a graph and leverages graph algorithms to identify optimal query plans. Our approach, 'GraphOpt', incorporates a cost-based optimization framework that takes into account data locality, network topology, and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional optimization techniques.
