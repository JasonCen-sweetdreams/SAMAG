Session-based search, where a user submits a series of queries to retrieve relevant information, is a common paradigm in modern search engines. However, the limited context and nuances of user intent in these queries often result in poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NQE-Session', which leverages the sequential dependencies in user queries to enrich the search context. Our approach employs a hierarchical transformer-based architecture to model the query sequence and generates expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on a large-scale search log dataset demonstrate that NQE-Session significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and user satisfaction.
