Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their use poses significant challenges for individuals with acoustic impairments. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the user experience of individuals with hearing impairments, cochlear implants, and speech disorders when interacting with popular voice assistants. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, combining usability testing, surveys, and interviews. Our findings highlight the need for more inclusive design practices, including acoustic adaptation, personalized feedback, and multimodal interaction. We propose a set of design guidelines to improve the accessibility and usability of voice assistants for users with acoustic impairments.
