Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph traversals and the need to minimize communication overhead. This paper presents 'Grapheon', a novel query optimization framework that leverages graph summarization and adaptive partitioning to reduce query latency and improve scalability. We evaluate Grapheon on a range of benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
