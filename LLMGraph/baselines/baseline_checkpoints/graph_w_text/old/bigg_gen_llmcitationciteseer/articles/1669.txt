Conversational interfaces, such as chatbots and voice assistants, have become increasingly popular, but their accessibility for people with disabilities remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to diverse abilities. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with individuals with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive disabilities, leading to the development of a set of guidelines and recommendations for designing accessible conversational interfaces. Our prototype, 'AccessibleChat', demonstrates the feasibility of these guidelines, providing a more inclusive and usable experience for people with disabilities.
