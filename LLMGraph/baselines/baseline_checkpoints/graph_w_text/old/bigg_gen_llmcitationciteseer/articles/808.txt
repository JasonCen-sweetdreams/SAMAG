Ad-hoc search often struggles to capture the nuances of user intent, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NQE-RL', which leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively refine the query representation. By framing query expansion as a Markov decision process, our model learns to iteratively select expansion terms that maximize the expected relevance of retrieved documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQE-RL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant gains in precision and recall.
