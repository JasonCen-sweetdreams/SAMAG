Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but their design often neglects the needs of individuals with dyslexia. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces, focusing on the cognitive and linguistic challenges faced by individuals with dyslexia. We conducted a series of user studies and expert interviews to identify design principles that can mitigate the effects of dyslexia on conversational interaction. Our proposed framework, 'DyslexiaAware', incorporates features such as multimodal input, error tolerance, and personalized feedback to facilitate more effective and accessible conversational experiences.
