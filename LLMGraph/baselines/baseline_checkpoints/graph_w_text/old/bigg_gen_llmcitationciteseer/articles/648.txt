Debugging and understanding programming concepts are significant challenges for novice programmers. This paper presents 'GazeAssist', a real-time adaptive assistance system that leverages gaze tracking and machine learning to identify and address knowledge gaps in novice programmers. GazeAssist uses a multimodal approach, combining gaze patterns, code analysis, and user feedback to provide personalized, context-aware support. Our user study with 30 novice programmers shows that GazeAssist reduces debugging time by 35% and improves code comprehension by 25%, compared to traditional debugging tools.
