Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Our approach, called QOptRL, leverages graph neural networks to represent query plans and incorporates a exploration-exploitation strategy to balance optimization and exploration. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that QOptRL outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
