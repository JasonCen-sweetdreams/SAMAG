Traditional information retrieval systems struggle to effectively handle large document collections, leading to slow query response times. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HierRank, which leverages a combination of semantic and keyword-based representations to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. Our approach exploits the hierarchical structure of document collections, using a recursive neural network to aggregate relevance scores from multiple granularity levels. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of both retrieval accuracy and query processing speed.
