This paper explores the role of multimodal feedback in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on its impact on user experience and performance. We present a novel framework that combines haptic, auditory, and visual cues to provide users with a more immersive and engaging experience. Our user study reveals that the proposed multimodal feedback approach significantly enhances user satisfaction, reduces cognitive load, and improves task completion time compared to traditional unimodal feedback methods. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR interfaces and provide guidelines for the effective integration of multimodal feedback in VR applications.
