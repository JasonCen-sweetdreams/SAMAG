In complex multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the relationships between agents and tasks. Our approach, called HetGNN, models the heterogeneous capabilities and preferences of agents as node features in a graph and uses attention mechanisms to learn the task allocation policy. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HetGNN outperforms existing decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
