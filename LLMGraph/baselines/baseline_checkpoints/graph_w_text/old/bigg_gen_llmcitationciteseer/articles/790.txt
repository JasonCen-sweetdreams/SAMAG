Virtual reality (VR) has shown tremendous potential in various domains, but user engagement remains a significant concern. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We designed an immersive VR platform that allows users to create and customize their own avatars, and conducted a user study with 50 participants. Our results indicate that personalized avatars significantly enhance user engagement, with participants exhibiting increased sense of presence, enjoyment, and motivation. We also found that avatar customization options and user control over avatar appearance are critical factors influencing engagement. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems and applications.
