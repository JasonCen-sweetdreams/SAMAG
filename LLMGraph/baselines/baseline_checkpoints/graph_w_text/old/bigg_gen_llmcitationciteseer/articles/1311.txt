Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, optimizing query execution plans for distributed graph databases remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. We design a graph neural network-based agent that learns to predict the optimal query plan from a set of candidate plans, taking into account factors such as data distribution, network topology, and query workload. Experimental results on a benchmark graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
