Traditional information retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of natural language queries, leading to suboptimal document retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture that integrates query expansion techniques to improve the semantic understanding of queries. Our approach, dubbed 'DeepQE', employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively expand relevant query terms, resulting in more accurate document representations. Experimental results on the TREC dataset demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
