Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short and ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to capture complex semantic relationships between query terms and document content. Our model, dubbed 'QNLP', combines a transformer-based encoder with a graph-based attention mechanism to generate context-aware expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QNLP outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
