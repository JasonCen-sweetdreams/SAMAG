As Augmented Reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, ensuring secure authentication mechanisms is crucial. This paper proposes a novel gaze-based authentication approach for AR devices using deep learning. We introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) that analyzes the user's gaze patterns to verify their identity. Our method utilizes a combination of eye-tracking data and visual attention cues to enhance security. Experimental results on a dataset of 100 users demonstrate an accuracy of 97.5% and a false acceptance rate of 0.5%, outperforming existing authentication methods for AR devices.
