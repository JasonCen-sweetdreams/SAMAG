Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they can provide transparency and accountability in decision-making. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture for ERS. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships and incorporates hierarchical graph encoding to capture multi-level dependencies. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of the attention weights, revealing valuable insights into user preferences and item correlations.
