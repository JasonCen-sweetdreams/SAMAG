Multi-tenant data warehouses face the challenge of optimizing query performance across diverse workloads and tenant requirements. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to query optimization in this context. We propose a novel RL framework, 'QOpt', which learns to optimize query plans based on a reward function that balances query latency, resource utilization, and fairness across tenants. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that QOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query latency and resource efficiency, while adapting to changing workload patterns and tenant priorities.
