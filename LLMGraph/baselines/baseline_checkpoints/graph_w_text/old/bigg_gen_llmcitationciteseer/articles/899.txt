This paper addresses the decentralized task allocation problem in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities must cooperate to achieve complex tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies. Our method, called GNN-TA, utilizes a graph-based representation of the agent network and task requirements, and trains a GNN to predict optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a variety of simulated scenarios demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation algorithms, achieving higher task completion rates and improved system efficiency.
