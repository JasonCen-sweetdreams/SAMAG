Few-shot node classification in graph-structured data is a challenging problem due to the limited availability of labeled nodes. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global graph structures to learn robust node representations. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively selects influential nodes and graph motifs at multiple scales, enabling effective knowledge transfer from few labeled nodes to unseen nodes. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness.
