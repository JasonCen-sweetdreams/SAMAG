Distributed database systems require efficient query optimization to minimize latency and improve overall system performance. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We propose a deep Q-network (DQN) based framework that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database system. The DQN agent learns to select the optimal query plan by maximizing a reward function that considers both execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our RL-based approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x while reducing resource utilization by 30%.
