Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly affects the performance and scalability of the system. This paper proposes a novel adaptive query optimization framework, 'AQORL', which leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust query plans based on runtime execution statistics. AQORL uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given workload and adapts to changes in the workload, data distribution, and system resources. Experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that AQORL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
