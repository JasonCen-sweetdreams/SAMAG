Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. Our method, dubbed 'DRL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy from historical query execution data. We evaluate DRL-QO on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
