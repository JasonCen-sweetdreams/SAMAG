In dynamic multi-agent systems, unexpected events often require agents to replan their tasks in real-time. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to coordinate task replanning among agents. Our method, called 'RT-Replan', uses a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn replanning policies. We evaluate RT-Replan in a simulated warehouse scenario and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, improving overall system efficiency by up to 35% compared to traditional planning methods.
