Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial for various applications, including healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity. Despite recent advances in deep learning-based approaches, interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies in time series data while providing explainable insights. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to focus on relevant temporal and spatial patterns, and a probabilistic output layer to quantify uncertainty. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies and providing interpretable explanations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
