Few-shot learning (FSL) has made significant progress in recent years, but most existing methods rely on a fixed set of classes and struggle to adapt to new classes. We propose a hierarchical FSL framework, HFSL-GNN, which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model relationships between classes. Our approach learns a hierarchical representation of classes, enabling the model to adapt to new classes by incorporating them into the existing hierarchy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HFSL-GNN on various FSL benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several datasets.
