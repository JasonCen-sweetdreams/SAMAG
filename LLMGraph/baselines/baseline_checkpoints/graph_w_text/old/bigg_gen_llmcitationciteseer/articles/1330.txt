Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval (IR), where a user's query often lacks sufficient context to retrieve relevant documents. Query expansion techniques aim to alleviate this issue by adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper proposes a novel deep query expansion framework, 'DQERL', which leverages reinforcement learning to learn an optimal policy for selecting expansion terms. Our approach utilizes a deep neural network to model the query-document interaction and rewards the agent for selecting terms that improve retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that DQERL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
