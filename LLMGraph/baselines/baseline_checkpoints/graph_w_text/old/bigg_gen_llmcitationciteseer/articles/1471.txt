Virtual reality (VR) technologies have the potential to improve the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments by providing engaging and interactive experiences. However, existing VR interfaces often pose significant accessibility barriers for this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible VR interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with stakeholders, including older adults, caregivers, and clinicians, to identify key design requirements. Our proposed interface design incorporates simplified navigation, high-contrast visuals, and audio cues to facilitate wayfinding and task completion. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to existing VR interfaces.
