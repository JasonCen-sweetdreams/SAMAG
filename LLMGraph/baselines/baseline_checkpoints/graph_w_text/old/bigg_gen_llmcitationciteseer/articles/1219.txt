Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in information retrieval, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in unstructured text. Existing approaches often rely on hand-crafted features or shallow neural networks. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical entity disambiguation framework that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to capture semantic relationships between entities. Our model consists of a graph attention module that learns to weigh the importance of neighboring entities and a hierarchical clustering module that iteratively refines the disambiguation process. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in cases where entities have ambiguous names or scarce context.
