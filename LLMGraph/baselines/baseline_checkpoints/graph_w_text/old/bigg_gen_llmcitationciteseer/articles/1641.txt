Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have gained popularity in recent years, enabling multiple tenants to share the same database infrastructure. However, query optimization in multi-tenant environments poses significant challenges due to varying workload patterns and resource contention. This paper presents 'OptiTen', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning-based workload prediction and tenant-aware resource allocation. We evaluate OptiTen on a real-world DBaaS platform and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
