Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-based learning, where only a limited number of labeled nodes are available for training. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework that leverages the hierarchical structure of graphs to adaptively focus on relevant nodes and edges. HGAT consists of a node-level attention mechanism and a graph-level attention mechanism, which are jointly learned to optimize node classification performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in few-shot node classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
