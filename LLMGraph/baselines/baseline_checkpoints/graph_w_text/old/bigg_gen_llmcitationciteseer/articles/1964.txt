Search engines often struggle to provide diverse search results, particularly when users submit ambiguous queries. This paper introduces a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages user search history, query intent, and semantic relationships to generate more informative and diverse search results. We propose a neural ranking model that jointly optimizes query representation, document relevance, and diversity metrics. Experimental results on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of search result diversification and user satisfaction.
