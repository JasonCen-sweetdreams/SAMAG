Domain-specific search engines often struggle to retrieve relevant results due to the limited vocabulary and nuanced terminology used in specialized domains. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach that leverages word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between domain-specific terms. Our method, termed 'Domain EmbEx', uses a combination of term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) and word embedding-based similarity metrics to identify effective expansion terms. Experimental results on a dataset of medical search queries demonstrate that Domain EmbEx outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a 23% increase in precision and 17% increase in recall.
