The proliferation of IoT devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation strategies. In this paper, we propose an agent-based framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize resource allocation in IoT networks. Our approach, dubbed 'Agent-DRL', employs a decentralized architecture where agents learn to allocate resources based on local observations and interactions with neighboring agents. We evaluate Agent-DRL on a simulated IoT network and demonstrate its ability to adapt to dynamic changes in resource demand and supply, outperforming traditional optimization techniques in terms of resource utilization and network latency.
