E-commerce search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant products from massive catalogs. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages user behavior and product metadata to improve search results. CAQE incorporates a graph-based entity disambiguation module to identify relevant product entities and expands the query with context-dependent synonyms. Our experiments on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of precision, recall, and search latency.
