Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it helps to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a neural keyword generation approach, called NeuralKeyGen, which leverages a sequence-to-sequence model to generate relevant keywords for a given query. Our approach is capable of capturing complex contextual relationships between query terms and generating diverse, high-quality keywords. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuralKeyGen significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, leading to substantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
