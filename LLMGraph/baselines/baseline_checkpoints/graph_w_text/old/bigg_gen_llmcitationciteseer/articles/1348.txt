Multi-agent pathfinding is a challenging problem in AI research, particularly in large-scale, dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel approach using hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to efficiently find collision-free paths for multiple agents. Our method learns to represent the graph structure of the environment at multiple scales, enabling agents to share information and avoid conflicts. We evaluate our approach on a variety of benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in computation time and path quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.
