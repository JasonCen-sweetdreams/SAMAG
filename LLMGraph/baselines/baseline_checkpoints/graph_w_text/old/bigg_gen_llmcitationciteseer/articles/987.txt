Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, remains a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the need to fuse information from diverse sources. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that efficiently integrates features from multiple modalities, enabling more accurate emotion recognition. Our HAN model employs a stacked attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features, reducing the dimensionality of the input space. Experimental results on the RECOLA dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of emotion recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.
