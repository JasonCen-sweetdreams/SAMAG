This paper presents a novel hybrid neural ranking model, 'HNRM', that leverages the strengths of both lexical and semantic matching techniques for efficient retrieval in large-scale document collections. HNRM combines a term-weighted inverted index with a neural network-based semantic scorer, allowing for fast filtering and accurate ranking. We propose a joint training objective that optimizes both the indexing and ranking components, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results on the TREC 2004 benchmark demonstrate that HNRM outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models while reducing query processing time by up to 75%.
