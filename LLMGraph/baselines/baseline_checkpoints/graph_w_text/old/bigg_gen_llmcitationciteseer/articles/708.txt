Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in many applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable anomaly detection. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture complex temporal dependencies and hierarchical feature extraction to identify salient patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN on several benchmark datasets, achieving improved detection accuracy and providing actionable insights into anomaly characteristics through attention-based feature importance scores.
