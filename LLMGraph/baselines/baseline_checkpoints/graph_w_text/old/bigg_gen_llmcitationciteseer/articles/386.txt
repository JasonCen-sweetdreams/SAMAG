Decentralized task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn efficient task allocation strategies. Our method, 'GNN-TA', represents the agent-task graph as a dynamic neural network, which adaptively updates task assignments based on agent capabilities and task requirements. We evaluate GNN-TA on a realistic disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized algorithms.
