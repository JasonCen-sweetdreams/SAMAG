Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning techniques to improve query optimization. We develop a query optimizer that uses a graph neural network to learn the query execution patterns and predict the optimal execution plan. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
