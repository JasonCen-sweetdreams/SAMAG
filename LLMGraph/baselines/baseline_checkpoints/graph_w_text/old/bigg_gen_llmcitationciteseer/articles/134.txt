Virtual Reality (VR) technology has the potential to transform various aspects of daily life, but its accessibility for users with visual impairments remains limited. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework that incorporates multisensory feedback and personalized assistance to facilitate navigation and interaction for visually impaired users. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that our approach significantly improved task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and accessible VR systems.
