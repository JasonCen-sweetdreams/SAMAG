Query optimization is a critical component of relational database management systems, particularly in distributed settings where suboptimal query plans can lead to significant performance degradation. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, wherein a deep Q-network is trained to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms traditional cost-based optimization methods, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x in query execution time.
