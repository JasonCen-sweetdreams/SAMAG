Autonomous agents are increasingly being deployed in complex systems to optimize resource allocation. However, coordinating their actions to achieve global efficiency remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to enable autonomous agents to learn effective coordination strategies. We introduce a decentralized framework, 'Agent Coordination Network' (ACN), which utilizes graph neural networks to model agent interactions and reinforcement learning to optimize their joint actions. Experimental results on a simulated resource allocation problem demonstrate that ACN outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.
