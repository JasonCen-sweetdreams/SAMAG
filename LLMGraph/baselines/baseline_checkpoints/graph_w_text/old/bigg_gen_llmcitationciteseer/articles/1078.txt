As the global population ages, there is a growing need to design effective interfaces for older adults. This study investigates the use of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in reducing cognitive load for older adults interacting with digital systems. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+, comparing a traditional graphical user interface (GUI) with an ECA-based interface. Results show that participants using the ECA interface exhibited significantly lower cognitive load, as measured by pupil dilation and self-reported metrics. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of accessible and inclusive interfaces.
