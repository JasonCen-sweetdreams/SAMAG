Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing systems often fail to accommodate their unique needs, leading to frustration and abandonment. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating accessible conversational interfaces for this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying key barriers and opportunities for design innovation. Our results inform the development of a novel conversation flow management system, 'CARE', which incorporates cognitive support features, such as contextual cues and error recovery mechanisms. A usability evaluation demonstrates that CARE significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing interfaces.
