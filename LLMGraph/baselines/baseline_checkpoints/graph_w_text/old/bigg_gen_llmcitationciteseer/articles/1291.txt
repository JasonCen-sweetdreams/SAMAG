Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in various aspects of life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings led to the development of a set of design guidelines and a prototype interface that incorporates cognitive support, error tolerance, and personalized feedback. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
