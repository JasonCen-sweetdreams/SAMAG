Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that leverage multimodal interactions and audio-based feedback to facilitate equal access. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with visual impairments and evaluated the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing their sense of presence and engagement in VR environments. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in user experience and provide insights for designing more accessible VR systems.
