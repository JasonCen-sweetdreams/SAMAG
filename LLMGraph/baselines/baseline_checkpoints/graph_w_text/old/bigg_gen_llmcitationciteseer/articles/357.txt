Query expansion is a crucial technique for improving the performance of ad-hoc retrieval systems. However, traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not capture nuanced semantic relationships between words. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach that leverages pre-trained language models to generate semantic embeddings for queries and documents. Our method, called 'NeuroXPand', uses a learned ranking model to select the most informative expansion terms, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines on several benchmark datasets.
