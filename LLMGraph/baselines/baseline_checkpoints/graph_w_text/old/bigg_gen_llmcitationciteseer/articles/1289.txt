This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed an immersive VR system that simulates everyday activities, such as cooking and puzzle-solving, using hand-tracking technology. Our user study (N=30) reveals that participants who used gestures to interact with virtual objects exhibited improved cognitive performance and spatial awareness compared to those using traditional controller-based input. Moreover, we found that the sense of embodiment was positively correlated with the degree of gesture-based interaction. Our findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and effective VR interfaces.
