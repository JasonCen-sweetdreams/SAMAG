Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to optimize query execution plans in distributed databases. We model the database as a graph, where nodes represent data fragments and edges represent communication costs. Our algorithm, 'GraphOpt', uses graph clustering and community detection to identify optimal query execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that GraphOpt reduces query latency by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
