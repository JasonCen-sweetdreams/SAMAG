Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query execution times. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
