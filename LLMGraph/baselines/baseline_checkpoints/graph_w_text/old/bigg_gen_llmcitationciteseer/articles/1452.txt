Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a critical challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatar customization on user engagement in VR environments. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, where they interacted with a VR game using either a default or customized avatar. Results show that customized avatars significantly increased user engagement, measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported enjoyment. We also found that customization options that allow users to express their personality and identity lead to higher engagement. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to enhance user experience and promote long-term engagement.
