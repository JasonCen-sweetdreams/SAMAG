In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. We model the agent-agent and agent-task interactions as a graph and train a GNN to predict the optimal task assignments. Our approach outperforms traditional methods in simulated environments, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of our algorithm under certain assumptions on the graph structure.
