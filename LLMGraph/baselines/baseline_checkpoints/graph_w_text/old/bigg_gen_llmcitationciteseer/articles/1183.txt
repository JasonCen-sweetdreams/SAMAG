Real-time autonomous vehicle control requires efficient and adaptive decision-making to handle complex scenarios. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'Autonomous-DQN', which leverages a hybrid architecture combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep Q-networks (DQN). Autonomous-DQN learns to optimize vehicle control policies in real-time, taking into account velocity, steering, and acceleration constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, showcasing improved performance and safety compared to traditional model-based control methods.
