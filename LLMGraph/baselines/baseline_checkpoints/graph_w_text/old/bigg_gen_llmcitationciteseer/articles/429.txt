Query optimization is a crucial component of database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and system efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in distributed database systems. Our method, called 'DROPS', leverages a DRL agent to learn an optimal query plan policy from historical query execution data. We design a custom reward function that balances query latency and system resource utilization, and demonstrate that DROPS outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource efficiency on a real-world distributed database benchmark.
