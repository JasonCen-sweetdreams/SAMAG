Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, which aims to reformulate the original query to better capture the user's information need. Traditional QE methods rely on manual feature engineering and suffer from limited representation capacity. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based QE approach, dubbed 'NeuroQE', which leverages the strengths of neural networks in learning complex semantic relationships between query terms and documents. We evaluate NeuroQE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval performance, particularly for queries with low term frequency.
