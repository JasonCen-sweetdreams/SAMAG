Virtual assistants (VAs) have the potential to significantly improve the daily lives of people with disabilities. However, current VAs often fall short in providing accessible and engaging interactions. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an inclusive VA, 'EmpathIA', which incorporates multimodal input/output, personalized feedback, and emotional intelligence. We conducted a user study with 30 participants with disabilities, demonstrating that EmpathIA outperforms commercial VAs in terms of user satisfaction, task completion, and perceived empathy. Our findings inform the development of more effective and user-centered VAs that cater to diverse needs and abilities.
