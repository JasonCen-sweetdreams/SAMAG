Virtual reality (VR) has shown immense potential in various domains, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, where we manipulated avatar customization options and measured user behavior, self-reported engagement, and physiological responses. Our results indicate that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, presence, and enjoyment, particularly among users with low self-efficacy. We discuss implications for VR system design and provide recommendations for incorporating personalized avatars in various VR applications.
