In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving shared goals. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework that utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments for autonomous agents. We model the task allocation problem as a decentralized Markov decision process and propose a Q-learning based algorithm that enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
