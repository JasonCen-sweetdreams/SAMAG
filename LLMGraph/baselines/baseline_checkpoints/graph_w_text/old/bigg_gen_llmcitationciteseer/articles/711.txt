Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources to dynamic workloads. This paper presents a novel approach based on self-organizing autonomous agents that adapt to changing workload patterns. Our proposed framework, 'SOARA', leverages decentralized decision-making and multi-agent coordination to optimize resource utilization. We evaluate SOARA using a real-world cloud dataset and demonstrate improved resource allocation efficiency, reduced latency, and enhanced scalability compared to traditional centralized approaches.
