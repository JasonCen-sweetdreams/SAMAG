Neural retrieval models have revolutionized the field of Information Retrieval (IR), but their performance can be significantly improved by incorporating query expansion techniques. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using pseudo-relevance feedback, which leverages the top-ranked documents to generate a set of expansion terms. We introduce a neural network-based model that learns to predict the relevance of expansion terms based on their semantic similarity to the original query. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in terms of mean average precision.
