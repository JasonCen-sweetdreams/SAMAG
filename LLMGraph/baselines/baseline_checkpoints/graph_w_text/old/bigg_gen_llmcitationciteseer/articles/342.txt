Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to transform various aspects of life, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with disabilities. This paper presents an inclusive VR interface design framework, 'AccessibilityVR', which integrates multiple assistive technologies to support users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a user study with 30 participants and evaluated the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing user experience, accessibility, and overall satisfaction. The results show that AccessibilityVR significantly improves the usability and accessibility of VR systems for users with disabilities.
