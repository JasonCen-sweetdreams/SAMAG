Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing graph queries in a distributed setting remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GrapHO', which leverages graph partitioning and adaptive join ordering to minimize query latency and reduce network communication overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GrapHO through extensive experiments on real-world graph datasets, showcasing improvements of up to 5x in query performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
