Distributed search engines (DSEs) are essential for scalable information retrieval in large-scale networks. However, query processing remains a significant bottleneck due to the high communication overhead between nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing technique, Hi-Q, to accelerate query processing in DSEs. Hi-Q leverages a multi-level indexing strategy that partitions the index into smaller, node-level indices and a global, hierarchical index. We demonstrate that Hi-Q reduces query latency by up to 37% and improves query throughput by up to 25% compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset show that Hi-Q achieves significant performance gains while maintaining recall quality.
