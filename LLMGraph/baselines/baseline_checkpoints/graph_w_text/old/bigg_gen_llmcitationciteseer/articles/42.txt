Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing queries for multiple tenants while ensuring isolation and performance remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MTQO', which leverages machine learning-based prediction models to identify optimal query plans for each tenant. Our approach incorporates a tenant-aware cost model and a novel plan enumeration algorithm to minimize resource contention and improve overall system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database system demonstrate that MTQO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
