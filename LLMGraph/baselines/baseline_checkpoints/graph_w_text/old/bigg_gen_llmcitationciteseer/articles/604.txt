In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a fundamental problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn distributed task allocation policies. We represent the agent-task graph as a heterogeneous graph and train a GNN to learn the optimal assignment of tasks to agents. Our approach can handle large-scale systems with hundreds of agents and tasks, and outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and system utility. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in real-world scenarios.
