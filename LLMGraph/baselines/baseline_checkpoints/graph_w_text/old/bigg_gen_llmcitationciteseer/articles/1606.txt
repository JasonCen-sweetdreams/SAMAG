Virtual reality (VR) systems often rely on visual and auditory feedback to convey information to users. However, the effectiveness of these modalities can be limited in certain scenarios. This study explores the benefits of incorporating haptic and olfactory feedback into VR experiences. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, examining the effects of multimodal feedback on user engagement, task performance, and overall experience. Our results show that the addition of haptic feedback significantly improves user performance in spatial awareness tasks, while olfactory feedback enhances emotional engagement. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of immersive VR experiences.
