Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, with applications in social networks, recommender systems, and bioinformatics. This paper introduces HAGCN, a hierarchical attention-based graph convolutional network that leverages both local and global structural information to improve node classification performance. Our model incorporates a novel attention mechanism that adaptively weights neighbor nodes based on their relevance to the target node, enabling more effective feature aggregation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.
