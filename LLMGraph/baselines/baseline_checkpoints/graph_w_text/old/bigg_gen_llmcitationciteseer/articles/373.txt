Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective passage retrieval to identify relevant contexts for answer extraction. However, the complexity of natural language queries often leads to suboptimal retrieval results. We propose a novel deep query reformulation approach, 'DQR', which leverages a hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture to refine and expand the original query. Our method incorporates a passage relevance predictor to guide the reformulation process, enabling more accurate and efficient passage retrieval. Experimental results on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that DQR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of passage retrieval accuracy and answer extraction F1-score.
