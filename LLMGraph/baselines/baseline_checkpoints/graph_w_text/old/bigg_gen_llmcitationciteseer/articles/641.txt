Despite the success of few-shot learning methods, their lack of interpretability hinders trust and adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates explainability mechanisms into the few-shot learning pipeline. HAN leverages attention weights to provide visual explanations for its predictions and introduces a hierarchical attention module to model complex relationships between support and query images. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAN achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing insightful explanations for its decisions, enabling more transparent and reliable few-shot learning.
