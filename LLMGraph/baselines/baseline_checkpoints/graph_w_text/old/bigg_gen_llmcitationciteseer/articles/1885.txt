Indexing high-dimensional data is a crucial task in various applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems. Existing indexing methods often suffer from high storage overhead, slow query performance, or a combination of both. This paper presents a novel compact hierarchical bitmap (CHB) indexing technique that leverages bit-level operations and hierarchical encoding to achieve efficient indexing and querying of high-dimensional data. Experimental results demonstrate that CHB outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of storage efficiency, query performance, and scalability.
