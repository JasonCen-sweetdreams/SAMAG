Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict optimal query plans based on query characteristics and database statistics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
