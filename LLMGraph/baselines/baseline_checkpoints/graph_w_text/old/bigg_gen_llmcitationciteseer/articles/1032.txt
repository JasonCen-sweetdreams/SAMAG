Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and behavior in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibit higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and self-disclosure, as well as reduced anxiety and cybersickness. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR systems and the potential applications in fields such as education, healthcare, and entertainment.
