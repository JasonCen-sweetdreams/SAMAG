The proliferation of NoSQL databases has led to a surge in document-oriented databases, which sacrifice ACID compliance for improved scalability and flexibility. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the lack of a fixed schema and the complexity of queries involving joins and subqueries. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'DocOpt', which leverages a combination of indexing, caching, and plan enumeration to minimize query latency. We evaluate DocOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing query optimization techniques.
