Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing accessible voice assistants, focusing on individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. We conducted a series of co-design workshops, revealing key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed framework, 'CARE', incorporates simplified dialogue management, personalized feedback mechanisms, and multimodal output to enhance usability and reduce cognitive load. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction, highlighting the potential of CARE to promote digital inclusion and independence.
