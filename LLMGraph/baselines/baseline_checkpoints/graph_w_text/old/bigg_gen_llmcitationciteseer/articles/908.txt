Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. Our approach, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the system's current state and the query workload. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world dataset and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
