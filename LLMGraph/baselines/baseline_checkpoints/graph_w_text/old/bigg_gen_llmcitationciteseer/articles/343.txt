Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach, which leverages a combination of sparse and dense retrieval techniques to reduce the search space and improve retrieval accuracy. Our HDR model first uses a sparse retriever to select top-k documents, and then applies a dense retriever to rank passages within these documents. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
