Deep neural networks are prone to making incorrect predictions on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Recent self-supervised learning methods have shown promise in detecting OOD samples, but they often require significant computational resources and labeled data. This paper proposes a hierarchical self-supervised learning framework that leverages both local and global features to detect OOD inputs efficiently. Our method, 'HierOOD', uses a lightweight neural network to learn a hierarchical representation of the input data and then applies a self-supervised contrastive loss function to identify OOD samples. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection while reducing computational costs by up to 50% compared to existing methods.
