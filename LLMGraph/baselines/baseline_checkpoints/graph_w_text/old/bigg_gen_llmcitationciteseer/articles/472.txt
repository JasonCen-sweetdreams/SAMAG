In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach, called HetMAL, leverages the structural properties of the agent communication graph to learn effective task assignments. HetMAL is capable of handling agents with varying capabilities and task requirements, and can adapt to changes in the system topology. We evaluate HetMAL on a variety of scenarios and demonstrate its scalability and robustness compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
