Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable suggestions to users. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture, which models user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph structure. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant user and item features, providing personalized explanations for recommended items. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
