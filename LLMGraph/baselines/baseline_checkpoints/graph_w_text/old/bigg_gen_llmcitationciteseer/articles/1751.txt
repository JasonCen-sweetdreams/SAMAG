Modern distributed information retrieval systems face significant scalability challenges, particularly in handling complex queries. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical caching framework, 'CacheHive', designed to optimize query processing efficiency in such systems. By strategically caching frequent query patterns at multiple granularities, CacheHive reduces the number of redundant computations and network requests. Experimental results on a large-scale web search dataset demonstrate that CacheHive achieves an average query latency reduction of 37% compared to traditional caching approaches, while maintaining retrieval accuracy.
