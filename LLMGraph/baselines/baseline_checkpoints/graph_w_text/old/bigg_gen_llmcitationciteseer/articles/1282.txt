Distributed database systems often struggle with query performance due to data replication and partitioning. This paper presents a novel adaptive replication strategy that dynamically adjusts data placement based on query patterns and system workload. Our approach, called 'ReplicaFlex', utilizes a feedback loop that continuously monitors query performance and adapts replication factors to minimize latency and maximize throughput. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReplicaFlex through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, showing significant improvements over existing static replication techniques.
