Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization technique, Lazy-Sharing, which leverages the concept of lazy materialization to reduce data transfer and improve query performance. Lazy-Sharing dynamically identifies and materializes only the required data shards, thereby minimizing data redundancy and reducing query latency. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that Lazy-Sharing outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 35% in terms of query response time.
