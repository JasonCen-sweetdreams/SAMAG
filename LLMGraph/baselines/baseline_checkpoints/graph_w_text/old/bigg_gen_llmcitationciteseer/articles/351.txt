Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval, as it can significantly impact the relevance of the retrieved documents. Traditional query expansion methods rely on term co-occurrence statistics, which can be compute-intensive and limited in their ability to capture semantic relationships. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using hyperbolic embeddings, which can efficiently model complex relationships between terms. We propose a hierarchical hyperbolic embedding framework that leverages both local and global context to expand the query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval performance and computational efficiency.
