We propose a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents in complex, dynamic environments. Our approach leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn cooperative strategies and adapt to changing task requirements. We introduce a novel graph-based representation of agent capabilities and task dependencies, which facilitates efficient allocation of tasks to agents. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to centralized allocation methods.
