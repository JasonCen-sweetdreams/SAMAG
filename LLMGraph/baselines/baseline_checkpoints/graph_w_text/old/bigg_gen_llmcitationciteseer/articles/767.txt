Semi-structured data, such as XML and JSON, has become increasingly prevalent in modern applications. However, traditional indexing methods struggle to efficiently retrieve data from these formats. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing technique, 'FlexIndex', which combines the benefits of both structural and keyword-based indexing. FlexIndex utilizes a graph-based data model to capture the structural relationships within semi-structured data and integrates a keyword-based inverted index for efficient querying. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that FlexIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of query response time and storage efficiency.
