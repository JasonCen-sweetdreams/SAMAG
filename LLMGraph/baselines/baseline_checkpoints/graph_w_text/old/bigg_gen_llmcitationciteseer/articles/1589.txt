Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to revolutionize assistive technology, but existing AR interfaces are often inaccessible to people with visual impairments. This paper presents a co-design approach to create AR interfaces that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. We conducted a series of workshops and user studies to identify key design requirements, such as tactile feedback and audio-based interaction. We then developed an AR prototype incorporating these features and evaluated its usability with 15 visually impaired participants. Our results show significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional AR interfaces.
