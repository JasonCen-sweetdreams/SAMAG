This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We propose a graph neural network (GNN) based approach that leverages the structural properties of the agent communication graph to allocate tasks efficiently. Our method, called HetGNN, can handle varying agent capabilities and task requirements, and is shown to outperform traditional centralized and distributed task allocation methods in simulations. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence and optimality of our approach. Experimental results on a real-world robotics dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HetGNN in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead.
