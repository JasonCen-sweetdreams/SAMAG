Ad-hoc search systems rely heavily on the efficiency of their retrieval models to provide accurate results. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'NeuRank', which leverages the strengths of deep learning and traditional IR techniques to improve query processing times. By incorporating a hierarchical attention mechanism and a term-weighting scheme, NeuRank reduces the number of document retrievals and accelerates query evaluation. Experiments on the TREC 2019 ad-hoc search benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and query latency compared to state-of-the-art neural and traditional ranking models.
