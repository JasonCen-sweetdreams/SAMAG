As data scales, optimizing query performance in distributed databases becomes increasingly challenging. Traditional indexing techniques often struggle to cope with the complexities of distributed systems. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to accelerate query execution. We introduce a hybrid indexing framework that combines the strengths of machine learning models with the efficiency of traditional indexing techniques. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements in query performance, often exceeding 2x speedup compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
