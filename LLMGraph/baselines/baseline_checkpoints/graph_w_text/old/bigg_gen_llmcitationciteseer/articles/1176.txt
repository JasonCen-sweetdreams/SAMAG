Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR interfaces can be inaccessible and overwhelming. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CARE-VR', a novel VR interface tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We employed a user-centered design approach, involving interviews and usability testing with 20 participants, to develop an interface that adapts to individual cognitive abilities. Our results show that CARE-VR significantly improves user engagement, task completion rates, and overall user experience compared to standard VR interfaces.
