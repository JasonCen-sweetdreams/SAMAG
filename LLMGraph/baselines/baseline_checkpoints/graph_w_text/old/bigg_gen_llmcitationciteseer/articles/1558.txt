Voice assistants have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but their adoption by older adults with cognitive impairments is hindered by usability barriers. This paper presents 'CogniVoice', a novel inclusive voice interface that incorporates cognitive support mechanisms to facilitate interaction. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults to inform the design of CogniVoice, which includes features such as personalized prompts, error tolerance, and multimodal feedback. Our evaluation shows that CogniVoice significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants, highlighting the potential for voice interfaces to support independent living for older adults with cognitive impairments.
