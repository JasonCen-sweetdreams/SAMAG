Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular due to their scalability and cost-effectiveness. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MT-Opt', which leverages machine learning-based modeling of tenant behavior and resource utilization. MT-Opt dynamically adjusts query plans based on real-time system monitoring and prediction of resource contention. Experimental results on a commercial multi-tenant database system demonstrate that MT-Opt achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
