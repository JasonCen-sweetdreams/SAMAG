Neural query expansion (NQE) has shown promising results in improving document retrieval performance, but its computational overhead can be prohibitive for large-scale datasets. This paper proposes an adaptive re-ranking framework, 'AQER', which dynamically adjusts the number of expansion terms based on the query complexity and document relevance. AQER incorporates a novel neural ranking model that leverages both local and global context to re-rank the top documents. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AQER achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art NQE methods while reducing computational costs by up to 40%.
