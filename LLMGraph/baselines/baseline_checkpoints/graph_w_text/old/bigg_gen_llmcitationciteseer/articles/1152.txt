This paper addresses the challenging problem of cooperative task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities must work together to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'CATARINA', which leverages Graph Attention Networks to model inter-agent dependencies and a decentralized actor-critic architecture to optimize task assignments. Experimental results on a range of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that CATARINA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion efficiency and agent satisfaction.
