Entity disambiguation in large-scale knowledge graphs is a crucial task for various applications, including question answering and text summarization. However, existing indexing techniques are often inefficient, leading to slow query response times. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, 'EDIndex', which leverages graph structural properties and entity co-occurrence patterns to prune the search space. We develop an efficient indexing algorithm that reduces the average query time by 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of EDIndex in supporting real-time entity disambiguation.
