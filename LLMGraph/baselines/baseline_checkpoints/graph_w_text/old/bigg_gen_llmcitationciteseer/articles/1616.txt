The increasing scale and complexity of distributed database systems (DDS) pose significant challenges to query optimization. Traditional optimization techniques often rely on manual tuning, which can be time-consuming and suboptimal. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to query optimization in DDS. We propose a novel RL-based framework, 'QueryOpt', which leverages a deep Q-network to learn optimal query execution plans. Our approach incorporates domain-specific knowledge and adapts to changing workload patterns, resulting in improved query performance and reduced optimization time. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of QueryOpt in reducing query latency and improving resource utilization.
