Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but existing methods suffer from computational complexity and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global structural information to accurately classify nodes. HGAT employs a hierarchical clustering scheme to group nodes into clusters, and then applies attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant neighbors and clusters. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, particularly on large-scale graphs.
