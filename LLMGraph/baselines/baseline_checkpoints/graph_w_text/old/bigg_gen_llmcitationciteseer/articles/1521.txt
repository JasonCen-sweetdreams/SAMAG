The increasing scale and complexity of distributed relational databases pose significant challenges to query optimization. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed settings. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy. Our approach, 'DQO', adaptively adjusts query plans based on runtime feedback and demonstrates improved performance and robustness compared to traditional rule-based optimizers. Experimental results on a distributed TPC-H dataset show that DQO reduces query execution time by up to 35% and improves resource utilization.
