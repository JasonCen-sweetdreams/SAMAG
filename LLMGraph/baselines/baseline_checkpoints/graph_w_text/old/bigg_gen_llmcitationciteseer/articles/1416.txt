Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing effective VR interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 50 participants, who interacted with a VR system using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that users with personalized avatars reported higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and overall satisfaction, and exhibited more exploratory behavior. We also found that avatar personalization had a positive impact on user self-efficacy and reduced anxiety in VR. Our findings have important implications for the design of future VR interfaces, highlighting the potential benefits of incorporating personalized avatars to enhance user engagement and overall experience.
