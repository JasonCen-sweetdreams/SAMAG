Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it can significantly improve retrieval performance. However, traditional QE methods rely on hand-crafted features and suffer from limited contextual understanding. This paper proposes a novel neural re-ranking approach, NeuroQE, which leverages deep learning to capture complex query-document relationships. NeuroQE integrates a neural ranking model into the QE process, enabling the selection of more informative expansion terms based on semantic similarities. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and robustness.
