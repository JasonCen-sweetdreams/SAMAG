Explainable recommendation systems are crucial in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare and finance. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that models user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph, enabling the discovery of complex relationships and attention-based explanations. We introduce a new attention mechanism that adapts to the hierarchical structure, allowing the model to focus on relevant user and item features. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate HGAT's improved recommendation accuracy and explainability, as measured by feature importance and graph-based visualization techniques.
