Traditional ranking models for document retrieval often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HiRank', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. HiRank learns to represent documents at multiple granularities, enabling it to capture both local and global semantic patterns. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiRank achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing neural ranking models by up to 30%.
