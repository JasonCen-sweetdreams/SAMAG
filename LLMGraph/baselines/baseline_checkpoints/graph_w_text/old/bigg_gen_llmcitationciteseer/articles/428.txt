Short-text document collections, such as those found in social media and messaging platforms, pose significant challenges for traditional information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages semantic relationships between terms to improve retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Our method adaptively selects expansion terms based on the document collection's term co-occurrence patterns, reducing the dimensionality of the query space. Experimental results on the TREC Microblog 2013 dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements in mean average precision and query processing time compared to state-of-the-art methods.
