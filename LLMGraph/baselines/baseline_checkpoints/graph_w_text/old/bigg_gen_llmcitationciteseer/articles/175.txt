This paper explores the application of embodied cognition theory to virtual reality (VR) interaction design. We present a gesture-based interaction system that leverages users' bodily experiences to enhance their sense of presence and engagement in VR environments. Our user study (N=30) compares the proposed system to traditional controller-based interaction, revealing significant improvements in user experience and cognitive load reduction. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more intuitive and immersive VR interfaces.
