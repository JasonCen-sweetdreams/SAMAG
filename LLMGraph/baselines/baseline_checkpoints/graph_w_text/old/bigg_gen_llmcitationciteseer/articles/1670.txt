This paper proposes a novel multi-agent system for real-time traffic management, aiming to reduce congestion and minimize travel times in urban networks. Our approach, called 'SmartRoute', exploits the concept of decentralized decision-making, where each agent, representing a traffic signal, communicates with its neighbors to optimize traffic flow. We introduce a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing traffic patterns. Experimental results using a real-world traffic simulator demonstrate that SmartRoute outperforms traditional traffic management strategies, reducing average travel times by up to 23% during peak hours.
