Knowledge graphs have become a crucial component in various applications, but entity disambiguation remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hybrid retrieval model, 'HybridER', which combines the strengths of both semantic and structural graph-based approaches. HybridER leverages a graph attention mechanism to capture contextual relationships and incorporates a semantic similarity module to disambiguate entities based on their textual descriptions. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HybridER outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, while reducing the computational complexity.
