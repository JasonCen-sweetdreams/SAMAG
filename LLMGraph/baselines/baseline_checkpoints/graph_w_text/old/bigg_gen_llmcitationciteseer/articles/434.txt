Coordinating multiple agents to achieve complex tasks is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep graph reinforcement learning to learn effective task allocation policies. Our method, 'GraphAgent', represents the agent-agent and agent-task relationships as a graph and employs a graph neural network to learn a distributed policy that maximizes the overall system reward. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAgent in a simulated logistics scenario, where it outperforms traditional distributed constraint optimization methods and achieves near-optimal task allocation.
