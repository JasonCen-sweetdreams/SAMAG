In this paper, we address the problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have varying capabilities and tasks require different skill sets. We propose a decentralized task allocation framework, 'HRL-TA', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn optimal task assignment policies. Our approach utilizes graph convolutional networks to model agent interactions and task dependencies, and incorporates a novel reward function that encourages efficient task allocation and minimizes agent idle time. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that HRL-TA outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
