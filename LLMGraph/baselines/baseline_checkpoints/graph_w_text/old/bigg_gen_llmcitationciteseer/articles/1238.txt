Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly popular, but they often pose significant challenges for individuals with motor disabilities. This paper presents an exploratory study on designing accessible gesture-based interfaces that cater to the needs of individuals with motor impairments. We conducted a series of user studies with participants having various motor disabilities, identifying key accessibility barriers and design opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel gesture recognition system, 'Easy Gesture', which incorporates personalized gesture profiling, adaptive gesture segmentation, and real-time feedback mechanisms. The results demonstrate significant improvements in user experience and interaction accuracy for participants with motor disabilities.
