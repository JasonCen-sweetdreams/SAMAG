Graph pattern matching is a fundamental operation in graph databases, but scaling it to massive datasets remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'GraPS', a novel distributed graph pattern matching algorithm that leverages parallel processing and probabilistic indexing to achieve high performance on big data analytics workloads. We demonstrate GraPS's effectiveness on real-world social network and biological datasets, showcasing an average speedup of 5x over state-of-the-art methods. Theoretical analysis and experiments validate GraPS's scalability, accuracy, and robustness in handling massive graph patterns.
