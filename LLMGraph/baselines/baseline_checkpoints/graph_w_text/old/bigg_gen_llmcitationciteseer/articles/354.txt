Passage retrieval is a critical component of open-domain question answering systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation approach, 'HDPR', which encodes documents as a nested structure of passages, sections, and sentences. Our method leverages a combination of dense passage embeddings and sparse section-wise attention to efficiently retrieve relevant passages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HDPR on several benchmark datasets, achieving a 15% improvement in retrieval accuracy and a 30% reduction in computational cost compared to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods.
