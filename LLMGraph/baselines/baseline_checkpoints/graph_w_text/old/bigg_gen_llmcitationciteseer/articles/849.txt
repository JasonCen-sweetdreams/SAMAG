Graph-based recommendation systems have shown promising results, but scaling to large user-item graphs remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical graph representations to reduce computational complexity. HGAT adaptively selects relevant subgraphs and applies attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between users and items. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing inference time by up to 70% compared to existing graph-based methods.
