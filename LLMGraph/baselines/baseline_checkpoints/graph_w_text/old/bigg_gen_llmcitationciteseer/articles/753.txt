Modern recommendation systems rely on graph-based models to capture complex user-item relationships. However, as the scale of these systems grows, existing models become computationally prohibitive. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture that leverages a hierarchical clustering approach to reduce the computational cost of graph attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of HGAN on several large-scale recommendation benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by up to 70%. Our approach has significant implications for deploying recommendation systems in real-world applications.
