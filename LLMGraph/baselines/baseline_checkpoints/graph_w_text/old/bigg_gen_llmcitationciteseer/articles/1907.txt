Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) contain diverse node and edge types, making node classification a challenging task. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework, which leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edge types. HGAT employs a hierarchical structure to capture both local and global graph patterns, and incorporates a novel edge-type aware attention mechanism to distinguish between different edge types. Experiments on real-world HIN datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks, especially in scenarios with limited labeled data.
