Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in various natural language processing applications, but existing approaches often struggle with scalability and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'GraphED', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) and knowledge graph embeddings to disambiguate entities in large-scale datasets. GraphED represents entities as nodes in a graph, and uses GNNs to capture their contextual relationships. We also incorporate knowledge graph embeddings to inject semantic information and improve disambiguation accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
