Distributed database systems (DDS) have become ubiquitous in modern data management. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge, particularly in systems with large numbers of nodes and high query volumes. This paper presents HQRoute, a novel hierarchical query routing framework that minimizes retrieval latency and reduces network congestion in DDS. HQRoute employs a two-tiered architecture, where a centralized coordinator node routes queries to optimal execution nodes based on real-time system metrics and query characteristics. Our evaluation on a large-scale DDS testbed demonstrates significant performance improvements over existing query optimization approaches, with average latency reductions of up to 37% and throughput increases of up to 23%.
