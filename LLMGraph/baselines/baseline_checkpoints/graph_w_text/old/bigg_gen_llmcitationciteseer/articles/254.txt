Node classification in heterogeneous networks is a fundamental problem in graph-based learning. Existing methods often suffer from the curse of dimensionality and fail to capture complex relationships between nodes. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant nodes and features at multiple scales. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to adaptively weight node features and neighborhood information, enabling effective node classification in large-scale heterogeneous networks. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HAGNN over state-of-the-art methods.
