Explainable recommender systems are crucial for building trust with users. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach, 'ExplainCluster', which identifies cohesive item groups and provides interpretable recommendations. Our method leverages a tree-based representation to model user preferences and item relationships, enabling the generation of meaningful explanations for recommended items. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ExplainCluster on several benchmark datasets, showcasing improved recommendation accuracy and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art methods.
