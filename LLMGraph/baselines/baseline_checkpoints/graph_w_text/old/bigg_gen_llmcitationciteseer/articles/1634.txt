Voice assistants have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults, but existing systems often neglect their unique needs and abilities. This paper presents a participatory design approach to developing inclusive voice assistants for older adults. We conducted co-design workshops with 20 older adults and 10 caregivers to identify design requirements and iteratively refined our prototype. Our findings highlight the importance of providing personalized feedback, simplifying navigation, and supporting multimodal interaction. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a functional prototype, which achieved a 30% increase in task completion rate and 25% increase in user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
