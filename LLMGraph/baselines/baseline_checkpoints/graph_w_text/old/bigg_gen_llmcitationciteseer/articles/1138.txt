Recommendation systems are crucial for personalizing user experiences, but scalability remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that efficiently captures complex user-item relationships. By hierarchically aggregating graph attention at multiple scales, HGAT reduces the computational complexity of graph-based recommendation systems while improving their accuracy. We evaluate HGAT on large-scale datasets and demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art models, making it a promising solution for real-world recommendation systems.
