In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in such systems. Our HAN model comprises two stages: intra-agent attention, which captures local interactions, and inter-agent attention, which integrates information across agents. We evaluate our approach on a real-world traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved decision accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional black-box models. Our framework provides a promising step towards transparent and trustworthy multi-agent systems.
