Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in many households, but their usability and accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remain limited. This paper presents a novel design framework for inclusive voice assistants that incorporates cognitive support features and personalized adaptation. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 older adults with cognitive impairments, revealing key challenges and opportunities for design improvements. Our proposed framework, 'CognitiveCare', integrates hierarchical goal-setting, error tolerance, and multimodal feedback to facilitate more effective and engaging interactions. A pilot evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
