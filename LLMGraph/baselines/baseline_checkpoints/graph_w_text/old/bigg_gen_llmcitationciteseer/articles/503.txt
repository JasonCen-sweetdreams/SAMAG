In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and fair distribution of tasks among agents. This paper presents a novel decentralized coalition formation algorithm, 'TaskCoal', which enables agents to form coalitions and allocate tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. TaskCoal uses a graph-based approach to model agent interactions and a distributed optimization technique to minimize the total task allocation cost. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that TaskCoal outperforms traditional centralized algorithms in terms of solution quality and scalability.
