As the global population ages, conversational agents have the potential to support older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing chatbots often fail to account for the unique needs and abilities of this demographic. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible conversational agents tailored to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, identifying key design recommendations for simplifying language, reducing cognitive load, and incorporating multimodal input. A usability evaluation of our prototype, 'CareChat', demonstrated significant improvements in user engagement and task completion compared to commercial chatbots.
