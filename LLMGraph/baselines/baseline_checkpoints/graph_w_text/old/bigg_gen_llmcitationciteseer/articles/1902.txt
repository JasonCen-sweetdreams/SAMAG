Latent semantic analysis (LSA) has been widely used in information retrieval (IR) tasks, but its performance degrades for complex queries. This paper proposes a novel query-aware LSA approach that integrates query semantics into the document representation. Our method, called QALSA, leverages a neural network-based query encoder to capture query intent and incorporates it into the latent semantic space. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that QALSA significantly outperforms traditional LSA and state-of-the-art neural IR models in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
