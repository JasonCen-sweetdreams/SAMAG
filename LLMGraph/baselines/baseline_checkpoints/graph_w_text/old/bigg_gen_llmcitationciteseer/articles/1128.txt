Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages statistical graph summarization and machine learning-based cardinality estimation to optimize query plans. Our experiments on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
