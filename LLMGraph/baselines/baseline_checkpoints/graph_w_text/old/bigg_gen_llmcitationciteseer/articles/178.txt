Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods often struggle to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages BERT-based contextualized term embeddings to model term dependencies. Our method, called CTERT, uses a graph-based framework to iteratively expand the query by incorporating terms with high contextual similarity. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset show that CTERT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a significant improvement in retrieval effectiveness.
