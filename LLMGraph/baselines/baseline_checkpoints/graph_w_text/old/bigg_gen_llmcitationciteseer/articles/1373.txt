As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent in industrial settings, there is a growing need for intuitive and hands-free interaction methods. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction framework for AR in industrial environments, leveraging machine learning-based gaze estimation and computer vision techniques. Our approach enables users to select virtual objects and invoke commands using only their gaze, reducing the need for manual input and improving overall productivity. We evaluate our framework in a real-world industrial setting, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction.
