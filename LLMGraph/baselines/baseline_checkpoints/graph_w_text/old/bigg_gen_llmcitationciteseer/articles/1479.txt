Ad-hoc retrieval tasks require effective matching between query and document semantics. We propose a novel deep relevance matching model, 'HierMatch', which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture multi-level semantic relationships. Our approach first employs a word-level attention module to focus on important query terms, then applies a sentence-level attention module to weigh the relevance of document sentences. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that HierMatch outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving a 12% increase in mean average precision.
