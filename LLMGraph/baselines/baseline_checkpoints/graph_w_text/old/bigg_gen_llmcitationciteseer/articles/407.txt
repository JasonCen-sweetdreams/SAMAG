Multi-label classification is a fundamental problem in machine learning, where an instance can be associated with multiple labels. Existing approaches often suffer from high computational complexity and neglect label correlations. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages label dependencies and instance relationships to improve classification efficiency and accuracy. Our HAN model consists of a label-aware attention module and a hierarchical graph neural network that captures label co-occurrence patterns. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
