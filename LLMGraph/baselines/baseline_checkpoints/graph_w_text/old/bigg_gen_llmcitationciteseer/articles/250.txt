Explainable recommendation systems aim to provide transparent and interpretable suggestions to users. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships and generate personalized explanations. HGAT consists of two stages: a graph attention-based user encoding module and a hierarchical graph attention-based item ranking module. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
