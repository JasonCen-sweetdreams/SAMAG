Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, dubbed 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of query terms and their contextual relationships. Our approach incorporates a multi-task learning objective that jointly optimizes query expansion and relevance ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, when compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
