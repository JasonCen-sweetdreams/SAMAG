Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly affects the performance and scalability of complex queries. This paper presents a novel adaptive query optimization framework, 'AQO', designed to tackle the challenges of modern distributed database systems. AQO leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and adaptive plan refinement to optimize query execution. We evaluate AQO on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and scalability compared to existing optimization techniques.
