Inferring user intentions from gaze patterns is a crucial aspect of human-computer interaction. This paper presents EyeGazeAnalytics, a deep learning-based framework that leverages gaze data to predict user intentions in various interactive scenarios. Our approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model the spatial and temporal aspects of gaze patterns. We evaluate EyeGazeAnalytics on a large-scale dataset of gaze patterns collected from users performing various tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting user intentions with high accuracy. The proposed framework has significant implications for enhancing user experience in applications such as virtual reality, gaming, and intelligent tutoring systems.
