Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained increasing attention due to the need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for ERS, which leverages graph neural networks to model complex user-item relationships. Our approach incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple levels, enabling the model to focus on relevant user behaviors and item attributes. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
