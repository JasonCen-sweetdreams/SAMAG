Traditional term weighting schemes in information retrieval (IR) systems often rely on simplistic frequency-based metrics, neglecting the rich contextual information present in digital libraries. This paper proposes a novel context-aware term weighting framework, 'CATW', which leverages semantic role labeling and entity disambiguation to capture nuanced relationships between terms. Our approach incorporates knowledge graph embeddings to enrich the semantic representation of terms, leading to improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on a large-scale digital library dataset demonstrate significant gains in precision and recall over state-of-the-art IR models.
