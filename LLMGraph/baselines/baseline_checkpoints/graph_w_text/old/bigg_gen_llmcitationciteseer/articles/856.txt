As the volume of digital data continues to grow, efficient information retrieval (IR) systems are crucial for querying and indexing large document collections. This paper presents a novel hierarchical document indexing approach, 'HiDex', which leverages a tree-based structure to organize documents and facilitate fast query processing. By exploiting the hierarchical relationships between documents, HiDex reduces the number of disk accesses and improves query response times. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HiDex outperforms existing indexing methods, achieving up to 3x faster query performance and 2x better disk storage efficiency.
