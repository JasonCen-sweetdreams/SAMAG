Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify the key challenges faced by visually impaired users in VR environments and developed a set of guidelines for designing accessible VR interfaces. Our proposed framework incorporates multisensory feedback, audio-based navigation, and personalized accessibility features to ensure an immersive and engaging experience for all users. We evaluate the effectiveness of our framework through a case study of a VR-based art museum and demonstrate significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction.
