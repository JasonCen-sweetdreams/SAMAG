Conversational AI systems often struggle to detect user intentions from limited data. We propose a meta-learning approach, 'IntentMeta', which leverages few-shot learning to adapt to new intents and improve detection accuracy. Our method uses a novel combination of episodic training and attention-based prototypical networks to learn robust intent representations. Experimental results on a benchmark conversational dataset demonstrate that IntentMeta outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot intent detection, achieving a 12% improvement in F1-score over the best baseline.
