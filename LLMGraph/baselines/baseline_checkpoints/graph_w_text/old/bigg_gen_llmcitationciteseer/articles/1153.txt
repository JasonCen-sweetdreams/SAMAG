Coordination among multiple agents in dynamic environments is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a decentralized coordination framework using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to facilitate efficient and adaptive decision-making. We introduce a novel graph-based representation of agent interactions and a hierarchical policy architecture that enables agents to learn coordinative behaviors. Experimental results in a simulated robotic soccer domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving team performance and adapting to changes in the environment.
