Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by inaccessible interfaces. This paper presents a multimodal interaction study that explores the design of an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, examining their preferences and challenges with existing voice assistants. Our findings inform the development of a novel interface that integrates visual and tactile feedback, simplifying the interaction process and enhancing user experience. We evaluate our prototype through a usability study, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
