Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for explainable time series anomaly detection. HAN leverages a hierarchical structure to capture both local and global patterns in time series data, and incorporates attention mechanisms to identify the most relevant features contributing to anomalies. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for the detected anomalies.
