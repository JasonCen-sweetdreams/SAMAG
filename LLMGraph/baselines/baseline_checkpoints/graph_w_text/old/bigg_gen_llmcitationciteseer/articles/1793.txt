Time-series data is increasingly ubiquitous in various domains, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, existing indexing techniques struggle to efficiently handle dynamic schema evolution, where new columns or attributes are frequently added or removed. This paper presents 'TSIndex', a novel indexing framework that adapts to changing schema requirements. TSIndex employs a hybrid approach, combining a lightweight schema-aware index with a compact, prefix-based representation of time-series data. Experimental results on real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that TSIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3.5x in query performance and 2x in storage efficiency.
