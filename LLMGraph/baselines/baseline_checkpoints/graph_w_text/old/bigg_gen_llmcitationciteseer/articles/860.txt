Cooperative learning in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem due to the complexity of interactions among agents. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework that learns to selectively focus on relevant agents and their relationships to improve cooperative behavior. HGAT integrates graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical clustering to capture multi-scale relationships among agents. Our experiments on a range of multi-agent cooperative tasks demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of learning efficiency and explainability. We provide visualizations of attention weights to illustrate how HGAT identifies key agents and interactions that drive cooperative behavior.
