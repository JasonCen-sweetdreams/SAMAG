Virtual reality (VR) has gained popularity in various domains, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, using a novel avatar customization system that incorporates machine learning-based facial recognition and generative modeling. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, measured through self-reported presence, satisfaction, and physiological responses. We also identify key factors influencing user preferences, including avatar realism, customizability, and emotional expression. The findings have implications for the design of immersive VR experiences that foster deeper user connections.
