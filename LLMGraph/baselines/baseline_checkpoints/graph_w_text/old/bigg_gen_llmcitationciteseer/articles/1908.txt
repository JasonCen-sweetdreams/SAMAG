Virtual reality (VR) systems often rely on handheld controllers or voice commands for user interaction, which can be cumbersome and limiting. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction method for VR using deep learning. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) that detects and interprets user gaze patterns in real-time, allowing for intuitive and precise control of virtual objects. Our approach achieves high accuracy and low latency, outperforming traditional computer vision-based methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system in a VR gaming scenario, highlighting its potential for enhancing user experience and accessibility in VR applications.
