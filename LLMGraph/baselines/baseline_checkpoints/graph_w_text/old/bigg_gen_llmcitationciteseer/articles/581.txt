Knowledge graph embedding has achieved remarkable success in various AI applications, but existing methods often fail to capture complex hierarchical relationships between entities. This paper introduces HierRNE, a novel knowledge graph embedding framework that leverages hierarchical relation networks to model fine-grained semantic relationships. By jointly learning entity and relation embeddings, HierRNE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, including WN18RR and YAGO3-10. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HierRNE in knowledge graph completion, entity disambiguation, and question answering tasks.
