Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense representation (HDR) approach for passage retrieval, which outperforms existing dense retrieval methods. Our HDR model learns to encode passages at multiple granularities, capturing both local and global semantic relationships. Experiment results on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves a 15% improvement in top-20 passage retrieval accuracy and a 20% reduction in computational cost compared to state-of-the-art methods.
