This paper presents a novel approach to persuasive gamification in mobile health applications, leveraging machine learning and HCI principles to influence user behavior. Our system, 'HealthyNudge', adaptively tailors gamification elements to individual users based on their motivational profiles, personality traits, and behavior patterns. We conducted a 12-week user study with 150 participants, demonstrating significant increases in physical activity and healthy habits among users interacting with HealthyNudge. Our results highlight the potential of adaptive persuasive gamification to promote long-term behavior change in mobile health applications.
