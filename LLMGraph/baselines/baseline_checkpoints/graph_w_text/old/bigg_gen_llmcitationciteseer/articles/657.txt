Deep web databases contain a vast amount of hidden web data, but existing retrieval techniques often struggle with effective querying and indexing. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-DW', which leverages semantic relationships between query terms to improve retrieval efficiency. HQE-DW employs a two-stage expansion strategy, first generating a set of semantic clusters and then iteratively refining the query through hierarchical clustering. Experimental results on a large-scale deep web dataset demonstrate that HQE-DW outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and query response time.
