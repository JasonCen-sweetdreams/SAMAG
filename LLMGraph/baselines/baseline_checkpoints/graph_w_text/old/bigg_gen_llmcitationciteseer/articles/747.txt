Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in enhancing learning experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR-based learning environments. We designed an experiment using a VR platform that allowed users to customize their avatars and compared their engagement levels with those using standard, non-personalized avatars. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, particularly among female participants. We also found that users with personalized avatars reported higher levels of presence and enjoyment. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based learning environments and suggest that personalized avatars can play a critical role in enhancing user engagement.
