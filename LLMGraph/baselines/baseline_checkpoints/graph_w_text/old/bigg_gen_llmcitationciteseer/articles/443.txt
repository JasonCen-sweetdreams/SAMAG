Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility for users with visual impairments, but current VR systems often neglect their needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for visually impaired users. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify key accessibility challenges and preferences. Our findings inform the development of a novel VR system that integrates audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized assistance. We demonstrate the efficacy of our system through a case study, showcasing improved user engagement and satisfaction for visually impaired users.
