Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly affects system performance and scalability. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on heuristics or manual tuning, which can be suboptimal and time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
