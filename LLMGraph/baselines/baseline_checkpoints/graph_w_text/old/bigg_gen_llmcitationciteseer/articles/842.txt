Natural language search systems face the challenge of converting user queries into effective database queries. We propose a neural query graph generation approach, 'NQG', which leverages a graph neural network to learn the structural relationships between query entities and database schema. NQG generates a query graph that captures the semantic meaning of the input query, enabling more accurate and efficient retrieval of relevant results. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQG outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of query accuracy and execution time.
