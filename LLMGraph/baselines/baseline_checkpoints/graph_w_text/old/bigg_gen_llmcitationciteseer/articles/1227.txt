Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in many households, but their adoption by older adults with cognitive impairments is hindered by usability issues. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant system, 'ElderVoice', tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of interviews and co-design workshops with caregivers and older adults to identify key design requirements. ElderVoice incorporates adaptive language processing, personalized feedback mechanisms, and multimodal interactions to facilitate effective communication. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
