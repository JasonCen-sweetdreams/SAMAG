The increasing volume of digital documents necessitates efficient and scalable information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel document indexing approach, Hierarchical Neural Embeddings (HNE), which leverages neural networks to learn a hierarchical representation of documents. HNE enables efficient similarity-based querying and filtering, reducing the computational cost of document retrieval. Experiments on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate significant improvements in query processing time and accuracy compared to traditional inverted indexing methods.
