Conversational agents have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing agents often rely on complex interfaces and linguistic structures that can be challenging for this population to engage with. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CARE', a conversational agent that incorporates cognitive accessibility features, such as simplified language, visual cues, and error tolerance. We conducted a usability study with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments and found that CARE significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to a standard conversational agent. Our results inform the development of accessible conversational agents that can support older adults with cognitive impairments.
