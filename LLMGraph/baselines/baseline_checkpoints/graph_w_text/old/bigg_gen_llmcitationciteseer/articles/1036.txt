Distributed relational databases face significant performance challenges when executing complex join queries. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'DistributedJoinOpt', which leverages machine learning and statistical analysis to efficiently optimize join orders and reduce communication overhead. Our approach incorporates a cost-based optimization model that accurately estimates join selectivities and leverages parallel processing to minimize query execution time. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that DistributedJoinOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and reduces network communication by up to 50%.
