Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in information retrieval and knowledge graph construction. This paper presents a novel approach, 'GraphED', that leverages graph-based embeddings and adaptive thresholding to efficiently disambiguate entities in large-scale datasets. By modeling entity relationships as a graph, we learn dense, context-aware representations that capture nuanced semantic differences. Our adaptive thresholding mechanism dynamically adjusts the disambiguation threshold based on entity frequency and graph structure, leading to improved accuracy and scalability. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphED in entity disambiguation tasks.
