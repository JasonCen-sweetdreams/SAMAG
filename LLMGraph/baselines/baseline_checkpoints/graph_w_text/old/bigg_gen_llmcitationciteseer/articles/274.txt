In multi-agent systems, task allocation is critical to achieve efficient and effective teamwork. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'AgentTA', where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on its local observations and interactions with other agents. Our approach leverages a graph neural network to model agent relationships and a deep Q-network to learn optimal task allocation policies. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that AgentTA outperforms traditional task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
