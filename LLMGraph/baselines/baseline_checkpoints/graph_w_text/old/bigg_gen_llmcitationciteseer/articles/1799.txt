Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to capture complex relationships within knowledge graphs. We propose a novel approach, Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Information Retrieval (HGNN-IR), which leverages multi-relational knowledge graphs to improve document retrieval. HGNN-IR learns hierarchical representations of entities and relationships, enabling the model to reason about complex queries and retrieve relevant documents more effectively. Our experiments on a large-scale knowledge graph and IR benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
