Conversational search systems aim to facilitate more natural and interactive user-system dialogue. However, the nuances of human language often result in ambiguous or incomplete queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query reformulation, leveraging deep contextualized embeddings to better capture the semantic context of user queries. Our method, 'ConversE', integrates a pre-trained language model with a graph-based query expansion framework, enabling more effective identification of relevant keywords and relationships. Experimental results on a large conversational search dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query clarity and retrieval accuracy, paving the way for more sophisticated conversational search systems.
