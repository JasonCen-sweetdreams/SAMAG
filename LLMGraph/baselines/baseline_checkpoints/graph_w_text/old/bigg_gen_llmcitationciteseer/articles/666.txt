In this paper, we present a novel approach to decentralized multi-agent coordination using deep graph reinforcement learning. We propose a graph neural network-based architecture that learns to represent the complex relationships between agents and their environment, and a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to coordinate their actions in a decentralized manner. Our approach is evaluated in a variety of scenarios, including traffic management and resource allocation, and demonstrates improved performance and scalability compared to existing methods.
