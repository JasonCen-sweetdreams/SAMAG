Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems struggle to effectively capture the nuances of medical terminology, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, MedExpan, which leverages deep learning-based word embeddings to better represent medical concepts. We demonstrate that MedExpan significantly improves retrieval accuracy on a benchmark MIR dataset by incorporating contextualized embeddings and corpus-based semantic similarity measures. Our results show that MedExpan outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, particularly for complex, multi-concept queries.
