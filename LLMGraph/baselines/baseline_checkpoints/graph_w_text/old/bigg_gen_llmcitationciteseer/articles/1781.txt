Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, where the query terms do not match the relevant documents. Query expansion techniques can alleviate this issue, but traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well. This paper proposes a deep neural network-based approach, 'DQN-QE', which learns to expand queries in an end-to-end manner. Our model leverages a combination of word embeddings, sentence encoders, and neural ranking models to generate expanded queries that improve retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of DQN-QE over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
