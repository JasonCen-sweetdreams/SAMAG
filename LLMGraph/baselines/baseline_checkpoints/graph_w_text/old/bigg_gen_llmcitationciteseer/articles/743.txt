Distributed relational databases (DRDBs) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, query optimization in DRDBs remains a challenging task due to the complex interactions between query plans and data distributions. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the query optimization problem. Our method, called GQN, learns to represent query plans and data distributions as graphs and uses GNNs to predict optimal query execution plans. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that GQN outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query execution time and plan quality.
