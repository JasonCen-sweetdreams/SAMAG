Query expansion is a crucial step in patent retrieval, where the goal is to identify semantically related terms to improve search accuracy. However, traditional methods rely on shallow lexical matching, neglecting the complex relationships between patent concepts. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach, 'PatentGraph', which leverages semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between patent terms. We construct a heterogeneous graph incorporating patent metadata, citation networks, and concept co-occurrence patterns. Experimental results on a large patent dataset demonstrate that PatentGraph significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 23% improvement in mean average precision.
