Time-series anomaly detection is a critical task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their lack of interpretability hinders trust and adoption. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to detect anomalies in time-series data. We introduce a hierarchical fusion strategy that combines attention weights at different scales, enabling the model to focus on relevant patterns and provide explainable anomaly scores. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms existing methods while offering meaningful insights into anomaly detection.
