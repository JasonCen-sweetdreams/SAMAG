Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages contextualized word representations to better capture the semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, ContextQE, uses a pre-trained language model to generate contextualized embeddings for each query term, which are then combined using a weighted averaging scheme to produce an expanded query representation. Experimental results on several standard IR benchmark datasets demonstrate that ContextQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving improvements of up to 15% in mean average precision.
