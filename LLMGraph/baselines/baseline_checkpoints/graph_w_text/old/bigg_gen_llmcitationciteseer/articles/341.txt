Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to improve the quality of search results by incorporating relevant terms into the original query. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NQE', which leverages deep neural networks to model the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our method learns to generate a set of expansion terms that capture the underlying intent of the user, outperforming traditional methods in both precision and recall. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of NQE, particularly in scenarios where the original query is short or ambiguous.
