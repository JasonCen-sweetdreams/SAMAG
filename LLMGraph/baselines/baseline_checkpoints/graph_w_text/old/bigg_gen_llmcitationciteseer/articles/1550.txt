Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in DDS due to the complexity of data distribution and network topology. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively optimize query plans based on runtime feedback. Our approach, called 'RL-QueryOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given query and system configuration. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that RL-QueryOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
