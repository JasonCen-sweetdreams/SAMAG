Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience in VR. We conducted a user study with 50 participants, where we manipulated avatar personalization and measured user engagement through behavioral and physiological metrics. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user satisfaction, immersion, and physiological arousal. We also identify key design factors that influence the effectiveness of personalized avatars, including avatar realism, customization options, and feedback mechanisms.
