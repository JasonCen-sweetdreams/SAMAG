Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its accessibility for users with visual impairments remains limited. This paper presents a novel framework, 'AccessibleVR', which focuses on designing inclusive VR experiences for visually impaired users. We employ a user-centered approach, involving co-design workshops and usability studies, to identify key challenges and opportunities for accessibility. Our results show that the incorporation of multimodal feedback, such as audio and haptic cues, can significantly improve the navigation and interaction capabilities of visually impaired users in VR environments.
