Virtual reality (VR) systems often lack tangible feedback, limiting the sense of immersion. We present ElasticTouch, a novel deformable haptic interface that provides users with realistic tactile sensations in VR environments. ElasticTouch consists of a stretchable, sensor-embedded membrane that can be deformed to simulate various textures and stiffness levels. Our user study demonstrates that ElasticTouch significantly enhances user engagement, object recognition, and manipulation accuracy in VR tasks. We also propose a machine learning-based approach to optimize haptic feedback generation, reducing latency and improving overall system performance.
