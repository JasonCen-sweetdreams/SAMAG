Decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, especially in scenarios with limited communication and dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies. We model the agent interactions as a graph and use a GNN to learn a distributed task allocation policy. Our approach is evaluated on a variety of benchmarks and shows significant improvements over traditional decentralized algorithms. We also analyze the robustness of our approach to changes in the environment and agent failures.
