Human activity recognition (HAR) is a crucial task in various applications, including healthcare and surveillance. Existing deep learning approaches often suffer from limited interpretability and poor generalizability. This paper proposes an explainable graph neural network (EGNN) framework for real-time HAR, which leverages graph-structured data to model human skeleton joints. Our EGNN incorporates attention mechanisms to identify key joints and temporal dependencies, providing insights into the decision-making process. Experimental results on a large-scale HAR dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance while offering enhanced interpretability and robustness.
