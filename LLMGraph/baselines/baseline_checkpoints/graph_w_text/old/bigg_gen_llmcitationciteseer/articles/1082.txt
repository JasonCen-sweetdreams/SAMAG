With the increasing volume and velocity of data, distributed relational databases have become a crucial component of modern data management systems. Query optimization is a critical component of these systems, but existing solutions often struggle to scale with large datasets and complex queries. This paper presents 'DistributedQuery', a novel query optimization framework that leverages graph-based modeling and parallel processing to optimize query plans for distributed relational databases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DistributedQuery through experiments on a real-world dataset, showing significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
