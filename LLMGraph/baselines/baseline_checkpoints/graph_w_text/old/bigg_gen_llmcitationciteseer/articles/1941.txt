Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for open-domain question answering, but its efficiency is hindered by the need to retrieve and rank a large number of passages. This paper proposes a neural ranking model, 'DPR-NRM', that learns to effectively rank passages based on their relevance to the query. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder architecture, where the query and passage encoders are trained jointly to optimize a ranking loss function. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DPR-NRM significantly improves retrieval efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy.
