Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing complex relationships between data entities. However, query optimization for graph databases remains a challenging problem, particularly at scale. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize graph query execution plans. Our method, called GraphOpt, uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query optimization, taking into account various graph properties and query patterns. Experimental results on a large-scale graph dataset show that GraphOpt outperforms existing optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
