Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed databases, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of modern data-intensive applications. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to optimize queries based on feedback from the database. Our method, called 'QOptRL', leverages a deep Q-network to select the optimal join order and indexing strategy for a given query. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database setup demonstrate that QOptRL outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
