The proliferation of IoT devices has led to complex network management challenges. This paper proposes an autonomous agent-based framework for dynamic resource allocation in IoT networks. Our approach leverages multi-agent systems to optimize resource utilization and adapt to changing network conditions. We introduce a novel negotiation protocol that enables agents to autonomously allocate resources based on device priorities and network constraints. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in network throughput and latency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
