Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data processing, but query optimization remains a major challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plans. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization. We also show that our method can adapt to changing workload patterns and database configurations.
