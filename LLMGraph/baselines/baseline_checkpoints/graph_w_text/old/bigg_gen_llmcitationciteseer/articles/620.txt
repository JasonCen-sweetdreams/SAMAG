Color vision deficiency (CVD) affects approximately 8% of males and 0.5% of females worldwide, making it essential to design visualizations that are accessible to users with CVD. This paper presents a novel framework for automatically generating CVD-friendly visualizations from existing color-encoded datasets. Our approach leverages a combination of color theory, machine learning, and user studies to create personalized visualizations that minimize color confusion and enhance comprehension. We evaluate our framework using a range of visualization types and demonstrate significant improvements in user performance and satisfaction.
