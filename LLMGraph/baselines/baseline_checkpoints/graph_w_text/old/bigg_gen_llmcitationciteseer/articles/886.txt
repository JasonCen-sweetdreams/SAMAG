Passage retrieval is a crucial component of many information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'NQG-Rank', which leverages query graphs to capture complex contextual relationships between query terms and document passages. Our approach represents queries as graphs, enabling the model to learn nuanced interactions between entities, concepts, and keywords. We demonstrate that NQG-Rank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models on several benchmark datasets, achieving superior passage retrieval accuracy while minimizing computational overhead.
