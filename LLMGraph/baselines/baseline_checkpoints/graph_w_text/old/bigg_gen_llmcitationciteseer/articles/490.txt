Distributed information retrieval systems (DIRS) face significant challenges in handling large query volumes and ensuring efficient response times. Caching is a widely used technique to mitigate these issues, but existing approaches often rely on static cache configurations that fail to adapt to changing query patterns. This paper proposes an adaptive caching framework, 'AdaCache', that dynamically adjusts cache sizes and content based on real-time query distributions. We evaluate AdaCache on a large-scale DIRS testbed and demonstrate significant improvements in query response times and cache hit rates compared to state-of-the-art caching strategies.
