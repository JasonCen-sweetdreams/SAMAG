Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to improve the retrieval performance by reformulating the original query. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep learning techniques to learn a semantic representation of the query and its related terms. Our approach employs a multi-task learning strategy, jointly optimizing the relevance and fluency of the expanded query. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various retrieval metrics.
