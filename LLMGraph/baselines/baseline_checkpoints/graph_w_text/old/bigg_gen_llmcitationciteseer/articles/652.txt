Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely on accurate document ranking to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Traditional approaches often rely on bag-of-words representations, which fail to capture complex query semantics. We propose a neural query graph model that learns to represent queries as graph structures, enabling the capture of nuanced relationships between query terms. Our approach, dubbed 'NeuQRG', uses a graph attention mechanism to weigh the importance of each query term and its interactions. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that NeuQRG outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving a 12.5% improvement in mean average precision.
