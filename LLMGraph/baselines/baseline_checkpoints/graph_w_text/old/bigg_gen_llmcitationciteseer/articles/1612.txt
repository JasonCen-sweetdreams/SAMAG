Diversified search results improve user satisfaction by reducing redundancy and increasing novelty. However, existing methods for diversified retrieval often compromise on relevance. This paper proposes a novel graph-based neural network architecture, 'DivGraph', which jointly optimizes relevance and diversity in ranked retrieval. DivGraph leverages document similarity graphs to capture complex relationships between documents and incorporates a novel diversity-promoting regularization term. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both relevance and diversity metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods.
