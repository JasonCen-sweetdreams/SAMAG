Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a given question. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HierRank, which leverages both passage-level and sentence-level representations to efficiently retrieve top-ranked passages. Our approach uses a two-stage framework, where a coarse-grained passage retriever is followed by a fine-grained sentence reranker. We demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art models on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA benchmarks, while reducing computational cost by 30%.
