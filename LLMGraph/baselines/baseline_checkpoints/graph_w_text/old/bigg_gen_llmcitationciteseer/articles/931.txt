This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We design a novel agent architecture that integrates a task allocator with a reinforcement learning module, enabling agents to learn optimal task assignments in real-time. Our approach is evaluated on a simulated warehouse management scenario, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion efficiency and reducing overall system latency. The proposed framework is scalable, flexible, and applicable to various multi-agent domains.
