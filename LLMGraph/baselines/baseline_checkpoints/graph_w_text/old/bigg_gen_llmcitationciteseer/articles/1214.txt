Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed relational databases. We design a Markov decision process to model the query optimization problem and train an agent to learn an optimal policy for selecting the best execution plan. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
