Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, but traditional methods often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem. This paper proposes a neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuroExpand', which leverages the semantic relationships between words to generate effective expansion terms. We introduce a novel attention mechanism that adaptively weighs the importance of each expansion term, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of NeuroExpand over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
