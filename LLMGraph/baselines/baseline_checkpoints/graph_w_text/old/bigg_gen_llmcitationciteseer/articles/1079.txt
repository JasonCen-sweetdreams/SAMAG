In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and optimize task assignments. Our approach, called GNN-TA, learns a distributed representation of the agent network and predicts task allocations based on local observations. We evaluate GNN-TA on a variety of benchmark scenarios and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
