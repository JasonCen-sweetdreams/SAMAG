Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, query performance remains a significant challenge due to data distribution and network latency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HierIndex', which leverages a recursive partitioning scheme to efficiently prune unnecessary data nodes during query execution. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HierIndex achieves up to 3x improvement in query response time compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques, while maintaining a reasonable storage overhead.
