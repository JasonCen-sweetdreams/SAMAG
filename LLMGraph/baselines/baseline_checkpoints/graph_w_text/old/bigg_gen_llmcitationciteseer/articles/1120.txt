Few-shot learning has achieved significant success in various applications, but it remains vulnerable to noisy labels in the training data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that adaptively weights instances and features to mitigate the impact of noisy labels. Our approach consists of two attention modules: instance-level attention to identify reliable instances and feature-level attention to selectively focus on relevant features. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HAN outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods in the presence of noisy labels, while achieving competitive performance on clean datasets.
