The proliferation of IoT devices has led to a massive influx of heterogeneous data, necessitating efficient data integration techniques. This paper presents a novel approach, 'IVM-IoT', which leverages incremental view maintenance to enable real-time data integration for IoT devices. IVM-IoT dynamically updates materialized views, minimizing the overhead of data processing and querying. Our experiments on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query response times and reduced storage requirements compared to traditional ETL-based approaches.
