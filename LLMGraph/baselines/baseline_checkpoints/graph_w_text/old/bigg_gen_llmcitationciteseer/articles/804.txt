As the integration of renewable energy sources increases, smart grids require efficient task allocation strategies to ensure reliable and efficient power distribution. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for distributed task allocation in smart grids. Our approach utilizes a decentralized policy gradient method, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on its local observations and interactions with neighboring agents. We conduct experiments on a realistic simulation platform, demonstrating significant improvements in task allocation efficiency and reduced power losses compared to traditional centralized approaches.
