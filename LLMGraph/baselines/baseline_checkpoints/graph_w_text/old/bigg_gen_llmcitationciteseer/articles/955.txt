In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes involve complex interactions and negotiations among agents. This paper introduces HAN-MAD, a novel hierarchical attention network architecture that facilitates explainable decision-making in multi-agent settings. HAN-MAD leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents, attributes, and interactions, thereby providing interpretable insights into the decision-making process. Experimental results on a real-world robot soccer dataset demonstrate that HAN-MAD outperforms existing approaches in terms of decision accuracy and explainability, while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency.
