Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern living, but their adoption by older adults with cognitive impairments is hindered by inaccessible interfaces. This paper presents 'EasyVoice', a novel voice assistant design that incorporates cognitive support and accessibility features. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults with mild cognitive impairments to inform the design of EasyVoice, which includes features such as simplified language processing, error tolerance, and personalized feedback. Results show that EasyVoice significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants. Our findings have implications for the development of inclusive voice assistants that can support aging-in-place.
