This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for autonomous traffic management. Our approach, dubbed 'Traffic Harmony', leverages a novel Graph Attention Network (GAT) to model complex traffic interactions and coordinate the actions of multiple autonomous vehicles. We demonstrate that Traffic Harmony can significantly reduce congestion and travel times in realistic urban scenarios, outperforming traditional traffic signal control methods. The proposed framework is scalable, flexible, and adaptable to changing traffic conditions, making it a promising solution for smart city infrastructure.
