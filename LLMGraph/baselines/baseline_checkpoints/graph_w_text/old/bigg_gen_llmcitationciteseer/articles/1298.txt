Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have become increasingly popular, but their adoption is hindered by usability issues. This paper investigates the impact of haptic feedback on user experience in VR. We designed a study to compare user performance and satisfaction with and without haptic feedback in a VR-based object manipulation task. Results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user accuracy, reduces task completion time, and enhances overall user experience. We also found that users with prior VR experience benefit more from haptic feedback than novice users. Our findings have implications for the design of VR interfaces that can improve user engagement and effectiveness.
