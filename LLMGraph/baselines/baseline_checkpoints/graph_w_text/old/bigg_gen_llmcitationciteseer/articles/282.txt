Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability and accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remain a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop inclusive voice assistants that accommodate the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our proposed framework, 'EasyTalk', incorporates cognitive support features, such as semantic prompting and error forgiveness, to facilitate successful task completion. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
