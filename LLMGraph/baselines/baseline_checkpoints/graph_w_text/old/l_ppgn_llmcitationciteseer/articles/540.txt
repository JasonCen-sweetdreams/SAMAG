Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed systems. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed databases. Our method, called QOptRL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on a reward function that balances execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that QOptRL outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
