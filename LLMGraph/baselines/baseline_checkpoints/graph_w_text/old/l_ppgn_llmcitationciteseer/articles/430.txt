With the growing demand for cloud computing, efficient resource allocation in multi-tenant datacenters has become a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'DeepRA', which learns to optimize resource allocation in real-time. We model the datacenter as a dynamic environment and employ a variant of the deep Q-network algorithm to learn optimal resource allocation policies. Experimental results show that DeepRA outperforms state-of-the-art heuristics in terms of resource utilization, response time, and power consumption. We also demonstrate the robustness of DeepRA under varying workload conditions and datacenter configurations.
