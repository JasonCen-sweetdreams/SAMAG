Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complex interactions between query operators and data distribution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the query plan as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn a representation of the query that captures its structural properties. Our approach, called GQN, outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of execution time and plan quality on a range of benchmark datasets. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the optimality of GQN and demonstrate its scalability on distributed systems.
