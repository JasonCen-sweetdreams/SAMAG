Real-time data warehousing has become crucial for organizations to make timely business decisions. However, query optimization in such systems is challenging due to the massive volumes of data and stringent latency requirements. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'CORDS', which leverages column-oriented storage to reduce query latency and improve system scalability. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that takes into account storage layout, data partitioning, and CPU-core allocation to minimize query response times. Experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that CORDS outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3.5x in terms of query throughput and reduces average query latency by 2.2x.
