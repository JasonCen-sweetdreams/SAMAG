Knowledge graph completion is a crucial task in many AI applications, but it is often hindered by entity ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel approach to entity disambiguation using graph attention networks (GATs). We introduce a hierarchical GAT architecture that leverages both local and global graph structures to distinguish between ambiguous entities. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art entity disambiguation techniques on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness in knowledge graph completion tasks.
