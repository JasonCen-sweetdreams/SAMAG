Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, optimizing query performance, particularly for join operations, remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization technique, 'Distributed Join Reordering' (DJR), which leverages statistical correlations between tables to minimize data transfer and reduce query latency. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DJR outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of network bandwidth usage.
