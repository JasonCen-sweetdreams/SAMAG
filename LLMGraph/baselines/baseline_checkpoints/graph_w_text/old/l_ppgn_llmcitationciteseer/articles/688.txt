Autonomous robotics applications often require multiple agents to work together to achieve complex tasks. However, distributed task allocation remains a challenging problem due to the need for efficient communication and consensus among agents. This paper presents a novel multi-agent consensus protocol, called DACoP, which enables agents to reach a consensus on task allocations while minimizing communication overhead. We evaluate DACoP in a simulated robotic swarm scenario and demonstrate its scalability and robustness in the presence of agent failures. Our results show that DACoP outperforms existing distributed allocation algorithms in terms of task completion time and communication efficiency.
