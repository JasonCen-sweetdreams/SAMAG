Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable recommendations. While graph-based methods have shown promise, they often struggle to capture complex relationships between users and items. This paper proposes Hierarchical Graph Attention (HGA), a novel framework that leverages hierarchical graph attention mechanisms to model multi-scale relationships. HGA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved recommendation accuracy and explainability. We further provide a thorough analysis of the learned attention weights, revealing insights into user preferences and item relationships.
