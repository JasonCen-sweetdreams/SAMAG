Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the reasoning behind their predictions. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms to identify relevant patterns and anomalies. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting anomalies and providing insights into the decision-making process.
