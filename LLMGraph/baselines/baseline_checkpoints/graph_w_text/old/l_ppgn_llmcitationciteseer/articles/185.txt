Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process of AI models. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HiGAT) framework for ERS, which captures complex relationships between users, items, and their attributes. HiGAT leverages a hierarchical graph structure to model the interactions between entities, and incorporates attention mechanisms to focus on relevant features. Experimental results on a real-world movie dataset demonstrate that HiGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
