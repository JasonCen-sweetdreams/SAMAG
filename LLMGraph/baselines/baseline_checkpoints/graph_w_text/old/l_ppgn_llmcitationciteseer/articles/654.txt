Query expansion is a crucial component of information retrieval systems, as it enables the incorporation of relevant context and semantics to improve search results. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. Our method, called Query2Vec, leverages a Transformer-based architecture to learn dense vector representations of queries and documents. These representations are then used to expand the original query with semantically similar terms, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Query2Vec, outperforming traditional query expansion techniques in terms of precision and recall.
