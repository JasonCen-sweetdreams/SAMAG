Multi-agent systems (MAS) have applications in various domains, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and smart cities. A key challenge in MAS is task allocation, which involves assigning tasks to agents in a distributed manner. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation policies. Our method, called Graph-TA, represents the agent-task relationships as a graph and utilizes GNNs to learn a distributed policy that maximizes system efficiency and fairness. Experimental results on a simulated MAS environment demonstrate that Graph-TA outperforms traditional methods, including centralized optimization and distributed greedy allocation.
