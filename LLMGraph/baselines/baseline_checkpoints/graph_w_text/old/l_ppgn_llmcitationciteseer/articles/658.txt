The increasing adoption of graph databases for real-time analytics has led to a surge in query optimization research. This paper presents a novel approach, 'GraphPulse', which leverages distributed query processing and adaptive indexing to accelerate query execution on large-scale graph datasets. We propose a cost-based optimization framework that dynamically reorders query operations and allocates resources based on real-time workload characteristics. Experimental results on a distributed graph database cluster demonstrate that GraphPulse outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x, while reducing query latency by up to 75%.
