Neural search models have demonstrated impressive performance in ad-hoc retrieval tasks. However, they often rely on limited training data and suffer from vocabulary mismatch. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroXPand', which leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to adaptively generate context-aware expansion terms. Our method incorporates a BERT-based relevance model to estimate the importance of each expansion term and a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the expansion process. Experiments on several standard benchmarks show that NeuroXPand consistently outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
