Coordinating multiple agents to achieve a common goal is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. Existing approaches often rely on complex, black-box models that struggle to provide interpretable explanations for their decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that enables explainable cooperation among agents. By recursively applying graph attention mechanisms, HGAT captures complex relationships between agents and their environments, generating explanations in the form of attention weights. Experimental results on a real-world traffic management scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving cooperation while providing transparent decision-making processes.
