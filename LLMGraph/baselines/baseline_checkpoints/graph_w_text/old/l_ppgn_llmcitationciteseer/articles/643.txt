Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but individuals with dyslexia often struggle to engage with these systems. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating accessible conversational interfaces for individuals with dyslexia. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with dyslexic participants to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel interface framework, 'DyslexiaAware', which incorporates tailored visual and auditory cues, error tolerance, and personalized feedback. A usability study with 20 participants shows that DyslexiaAware significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to standard conversational interfaces.
