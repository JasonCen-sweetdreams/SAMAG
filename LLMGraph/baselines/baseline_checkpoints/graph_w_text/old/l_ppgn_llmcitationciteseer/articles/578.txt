Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the quality of the retrieved documents. While traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and heuristics, we propose a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning. Our model, called DQN-QE, learns to select the most informative expansion terms by interacting with a simulated retrieval environment. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that DQN-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of precision, recall, and MAP.
