Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval to reduce the search space for answer extraction. This paper presents a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach that leverages both coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic matching to retrieve relevant passages. Our method first uses a dense retriever to select top-N passages and then applies a hierarchical ranking model to re-rank the candidates based on their relevance to the question. Experimental results on the Natural Questions benchmark demonstrate that HDR outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods, achieving a 15% improvement in top-20 retrieval accuracy while reducing computational cost by 30%.
