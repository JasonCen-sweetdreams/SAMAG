Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management, but efficient query processing remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'DIMS', designed for multi-dimensional range queries in distributed environments. DIMS leverages a combination of grid-based partitioning and locality-sensitive hashing to minimize communication overhead and reduce query latency. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DIMS outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query throughput, while maintaining a reasonable storage overhead.
