In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. We propose a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach utilizes a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn task allocation policies. We evaluate our framework on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
