Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in education, but personalization remains a crucial aspect to enhance user engagement. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and learning outcomes in VR-based learning environments. We designed an experiment with 120 participants, randomly assigned to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Our results indicate that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, improved learning outcomes, and higher self-reported motivation. We also analyze the impact of avatar personalization on user presence and cognitive load, providing insights for the design of VR-based educational systems.
