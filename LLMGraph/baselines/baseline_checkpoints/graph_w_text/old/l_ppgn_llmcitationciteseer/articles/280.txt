This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a hierarchical framework that combines a high-level task allocator with a low-level action executor, both trained using deep Q-networks. Our approach enables scalable and efficient task allocation in large-scale multi-agent systems, while adapting to dynamic changes in the environment and agent capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to state-of-the-art methods.
