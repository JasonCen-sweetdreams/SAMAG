Traditional query optimization techniques rely on complex cost models and heuristics, which can be inaccurate and inefficient for modern main-memory databases. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to optimize query execution. We design a neural network-based framework that learns to predict optimal query plans from a database's workload and physical design. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of execution time, while also reducing memory usage by up to 25%
