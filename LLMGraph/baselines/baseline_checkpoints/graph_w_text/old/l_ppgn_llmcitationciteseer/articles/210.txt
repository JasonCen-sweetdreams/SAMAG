Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but existing methods suffer from scalability issues as the graph size increases. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages a hierarchical clustering algorithm to recursively coarsen the graph, reducing the computational complexity of attention mechanisms. HGAT uses a multi-scale attention scheme to aggregate features from different levels of the hierarchy, enabling efficient node classification on large graphs. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability.
