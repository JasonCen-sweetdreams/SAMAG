Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph structures and the distributed nature of the data. This paper proposes a novel approach to scalable query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on the query execution time. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
