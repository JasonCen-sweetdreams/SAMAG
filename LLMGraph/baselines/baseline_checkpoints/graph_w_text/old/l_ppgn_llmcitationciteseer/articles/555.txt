Voice assistants have transformed the way we interact with technology, but their benefits are often inaccessible to older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents an inclusive design approach for voice assistants that addresses the needs of this population. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed design, 'CAREVoice', incorporates personalized cognitive support, multimodal input, and caregiving features to enhance usability and accessibility. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
