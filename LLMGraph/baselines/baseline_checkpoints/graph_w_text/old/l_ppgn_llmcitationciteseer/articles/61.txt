Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the lives of users with visual impairments, but current VR systems often neglect their needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for visually impaired users. We conducted co-design workshops with visually impaired participants to identify key accessibility challenges and opportunities. Our findings informed the development of a novel VR system, 'EchoTouch', which incorporates haptic feedback, audio cues, and simplified navigation. A user study with 20 visually impaired participants demonstrated significant improvements in VR experience quality and user satisfaction compared to existing VR systems.
