Distributed database systems pose significant query optimization challenges due to the complexity of data distribution and parallel processing. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to adapt to changing database workloads and optimize query execution plans. Our proposed algorithm, 'RL-Opt', utilizes a deep Q-network to evaluate the quality of query plans and converges to near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms traditional cost-based optimization methods by up to 30% in terms of execution time.
