Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but the impact of color schemes on user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of adaptive color schemes in VR, investigating how they influence user engagement, cognitive load, and overall satisfaction. Our user study involves 30 participants interacting with a VR environment using three different color schemes: static, adaptive, and personalized. Results show that adaptive color schemes significantly improve user experience, reducing cognitive load and increasing engagement. We provide guidelines for designers to create effective color schemes in VR interfaces, enhancing overall user experience.
