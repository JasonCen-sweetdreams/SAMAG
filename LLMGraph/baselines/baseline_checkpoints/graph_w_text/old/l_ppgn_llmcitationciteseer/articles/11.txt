Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks (DNNs). Our proposed architecture, 'QueryEx', leverages a combination of pre-trained language models and bespoke query-specific embeddings to generate high-quality expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain over state-of-the-art query expansion methods, while reducing computational overhead.
