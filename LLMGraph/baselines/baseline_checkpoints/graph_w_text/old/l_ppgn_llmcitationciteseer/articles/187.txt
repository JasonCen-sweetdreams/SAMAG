Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it can significantly impact the retrieval effectiveness. Traditional query expansion methods rely on hand-crafted features and rules, which often fail to capture the nuances of natural language queries. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to learn semantic query representations. We utilize a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query expansion and retrieval, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Experiments on several standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepQE, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods by a significant margin.
