Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data, but query processing remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel decentralized indexing approach, 'Dexi', which partitioning the indexing responsibility among nodes in a distributed system. Dexi leverages a hierarchical indexing structure and a probabilistic query routing mechanism to minimize communication overhead and improve query response times. Experiments on a simulated distributed database demonstrate that Dexi outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of query latency and throughput, while maintaining comparable storage efficiency.
