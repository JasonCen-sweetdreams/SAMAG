This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) framework for efficient multi-agent pathfinding in complex environments. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant neurons and edges, reducing computational overhead and improving scalability. We propose a hierarchical architecture that decomposes the pathfinding problem into local and global planning stages, enabling agents to adapt to dynamic environments and avoid collisions. Experimental results on several benchmark scenarios demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
