Expert search systems aim to retrieve the most relevant documents for a given query. However, the majority of existing approaches rely on traditional information retrieval techniques, which often struggle to capture the nuances of expert queries. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'ExpertFilter', which leverages a hierarchical neural network to learn a robust document representation. Our experiments on the TREC Expert Search dataset demonstrate that ExpertFilter outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision. Moreover, we show that our approach can be easily integrated with existing ranking models to further improve retrieval performance.
