Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, 'RL-Opt', utilizes a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plan based on runtime feedback. We evaluate RL-Opt on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and scalability compared to traditional optimization techniques. Our results show that RL-Opt can adapt to varying workloads and system configurations, making it a promising solution for large-scale data processing.
