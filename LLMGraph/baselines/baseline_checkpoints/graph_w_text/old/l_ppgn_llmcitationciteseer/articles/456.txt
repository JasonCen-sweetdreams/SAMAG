Passage retrieval is a crucial component of many information retrieval systems. However, existing methods often conflate query intent and document structure, leading to suboptimal performance. We propose a novel approach, 'DISCO', which decouples these two aspects using a hierarchical neural network architecture. Our model first infers the query intent using a contextualized language model, and then applies a structured document encoder to capture passage-level relevance. Experimental results on the TREC Deep Learning Track demonstrate that DISCO outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval models, achieving a 12% increase in mean average precision.
