In multi-agent systems, decision making is often complex and difficult to interpret. This paper introduces Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) to improve the explainability of agent decision making. HANs leverage hierarchical graph attention mechanisms to learn agent representations and capture complex interactions between agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HANs in a variety of multi-agent scenarios, including autonomous vehicle control and smart grid management. Experimental results show that HANs outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of decision making accuracy and provide insights into agent decision making processes.
