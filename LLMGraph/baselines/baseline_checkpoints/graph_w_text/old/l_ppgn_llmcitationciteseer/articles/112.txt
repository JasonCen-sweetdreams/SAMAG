This paper introduces Neural Query Graph Convolutional Networks (NQ-GCN), a novel neural ranking model for ad-hoc information retrieval. NQ-GCN leverages the strengths of graph convolutional networks and neural query encoding to capture complex query-document relationships. Our experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in ranking performance over state-of-the-art neural ranking models, with notable gains in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain. We also provide an in-depth analysis of NQ-GCN's ability to generalize to out-of-domain queries and documents.
