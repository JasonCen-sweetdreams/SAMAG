Time-series forecasting with multi-resolution data is a challenging problem, particularly in domains where data is collected at varying frequencies and resolutions. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of both convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Our HAN architecture learns to selectively focus on relevant input features and scales, enabling efficient forecasting at multiple resolutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world datasets, including energy consumption, traffic flow, and financial time series, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
