Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering and suffer from limited scalability. We propose a novel QE approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. Our model integrates a query encoder, a document encoder, and a relevance predictor, and is trained end-to-end using a large-scale web search dataset. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing computational overhead by up to 40%.
