Remote collaboration has become ubiquitous, but the lack of nonverbal cues hinders effective communication. This paper presents EyeContactLens, a novel system that leverages multimodal gaze-based feedback to enhance remote collaboration. Our approach combines computer vision, machine learning, and human-computer interaction to detect and analyze gaze patterns, providing real-time feedback to collaborators. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating that EyeContactLens improves communication efficiency, reduces misunderstandings, and enhances overall collaboration experience. Our findings have significant implications for remote work, online education, and virtual meetings.
