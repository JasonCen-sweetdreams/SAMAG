Traditional query optimization techniques rely on complex cost models and heuristics, which can lead to suboptimal query plans. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to optimize query execution. We propose a neural network-based architecture, 'QLearn', which learns to predict the optimal query plan based on the input query and database statistics. Our experimental evaluation on a variety of real-world workloads demonstrates that QLearn outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time, while maintaining robustness to changing database statistics.
