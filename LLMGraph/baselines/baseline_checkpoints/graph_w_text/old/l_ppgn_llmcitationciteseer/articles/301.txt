Short-text retrieval is a challenging problem in information retrieval due to the limited context and ambiguity of query terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between words and phrases. Our model, called 'QuExpan', uses a combination of word embeddings and convolutional neural networks to generate a set of relevant expansion terms that can be added to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that QuExpan significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, improving the mean average precision by up to 15%.
