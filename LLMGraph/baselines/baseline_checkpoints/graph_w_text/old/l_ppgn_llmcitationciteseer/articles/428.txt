Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but its adoption is hindered by accessibility barriers. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving co-design workshops, usability testing, and cognitive assessments to identify key design factors that impact VR accessibility. Our findings highlight the importance of simplifying user interfaces, providing clear auditory cues, and incorporating cognitive support mechanisms. We propose a set of evidence-based guidelines for designing accessible VR experiences that can be used by practitioners and researchers in the field.
