Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when queries lack context or contain ambiguous terms. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, which learns to generate relevant expansion terms from a large corpus of documents. Our method, dubbed 'NeuroQE', employs a bidirectional transformer encoder to capture query-document relationships and generates expansion terms through a conditional language modeling framework. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving up to 15% increase in mean average precision.
