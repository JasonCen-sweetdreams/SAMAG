Knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for various AI applications, but they often suffer from incomplete and ambiguous information. This paper proposes a novel entity disambiguation approach, 'GraphDE', which leverages graph attention networks to resolve ambiguity in KG entities. GraphDE represents entities as nodes in a graph and models their relationships using attention mechanisms. We evaluate GraphDE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in KG completion tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in entity disambiguation and link prediction tasks.
