This paper proposes a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, called 'CoopTAR', utilizes a hybrid framework that combines centralized and decentralized decision-making to achieve coordinated task allocation. We employ a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture, where high-level policies guide the allocation of tasks to agents, and low-level policies control the execution of tasks by individual agents. Experimental results in a simulated environment demonstrate that CoopTAR outperforms traditional approaches in terms of task completion efficiency and system robustness.
