Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and varying system loads. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans based on runtime feedback from the system. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional rule-based optimizers.
