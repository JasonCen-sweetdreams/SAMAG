Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, optimizing query performance in distributed graph databases remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'DynaGraph', a novel query optimization framework that leverages graph partitioning and dynamic reordering of query operations to minimize communication overhead and maximize parallelism. We evaluate DynaGraph on a real-world social network dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query latency and throughput compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
