Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and facial expressions, is a challenging task due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the data. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) framework that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and time-steps to improve emotion recognition accuracy. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers, followed by a hierarchical fusion layer that integrates the outputs from each modality. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal data.
