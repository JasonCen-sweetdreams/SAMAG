Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, optimizing query performance in distributed graph databases remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph partitioning and parallel processing to minimize query latency. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that considers both data locality and communication costs, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a large-scale graph dataset. Experimental results show that GraphOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
