In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. Our approach, called GraphTask, represents the agent-task graph as a GNN and uses a distributed optimization algorithm to find the optimal task allocation. We evaluate GraphTask on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform traditional centralized and decentralized task allocation methods. Furthermore, we show that GraphTask can adapt to dynamic changes in the agent-task graph, making it a promising solution for real-world multi-agent systems.
