This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, enabling efficient and adaptive distribution of tasks in dynamic environments. We formulate the task allocation problem as a distributed constraint optimization problem and develop a novel algorithm, D-COA, that leverages graph neural networks and consensus protocols to achieve near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that D-COA outperforms existing decentralized approaches in terms of allocation efficiency and adaptability to changing task requirements.
