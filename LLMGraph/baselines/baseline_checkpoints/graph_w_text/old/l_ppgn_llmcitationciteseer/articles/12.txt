Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. Despite the success of deep learning models, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time series anomaly detection. Our HAN model consists of a attention-based encoder that learns to focus on relevant segments of the time series and a decoder that generates anomaly scores. We introduce a novel attention regularization technique that encourages the model to attend to diverse and meaningful segments. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our HAN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides insightful explanations for the detected anomalies.
