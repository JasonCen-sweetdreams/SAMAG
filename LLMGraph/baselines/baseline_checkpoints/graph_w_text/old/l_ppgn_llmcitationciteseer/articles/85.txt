Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it significantly impacts the recall and precision of search results. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, leveraging semantic embeddings to capture the nuances of word meanings and relationships. Our model, called 'semex', uses a combination of word2vec and BERT to generate context-aware embeddings, which are then used to expand the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that semex outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, improving the mean average precision by up to 15%.
