This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation for multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities must coordinate to achieve complex tasks. We formulate the problem as a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) and propose a decentralized algorithm that leverages local search and constraint propagation to find near-optimal solutions. Our approach ensures that each agent's autonomy is preserved while still achieving global optimality. Experimental results on a realistic robotic search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization compared to existing methods.
