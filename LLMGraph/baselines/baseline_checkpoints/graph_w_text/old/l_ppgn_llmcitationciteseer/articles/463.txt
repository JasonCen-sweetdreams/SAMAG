Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but the impact of personalized avatars on user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effects of customized avatars on user engagement, emotional response, and cognitive load in VR environments. Our user study involves 120 participants and employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative feedback. Results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance user experience, particularly for users with high levels of self-identification with their avatars. We discuss implications for VR system design and provide guidelines for creating effective, user-centered avatars.
