Distributed column stores have become a popular choice for big data analytics, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the optimal join order, indexing strategy, and data partitioning scheme based on query characteristics and system resources. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional cost-based optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
