Column-oriented NoSQL databases have gained popularity in big data analytics due to their ability to handle massive amounts of data efficiently. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages statistical correlation analysis and machine learning-based cost modeling to optimize query execution plans. We demonstrate that ColOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques in reducing query latency and improving system throughput on a variety of real-world workloads.
