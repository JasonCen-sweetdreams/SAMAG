Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that integrates explainability into the anomaly detection process. HAN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant segments and features of the time series, allowing for identification of anomalous patterns. We evaluate HAN on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting anomalies while providing meaningful explanations for its predictions.
