Query expansion techniques have been widely used to improve the performance of information retrieval systems. However, most existing methods rely on complex linguistic analysis or resource-intensive machine learning models, which can be restrictive for short-text document collections. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages both local and global term relationships to generate informative expansion terms. Our method is efficient, scalable, and adaptable to various retrieval settings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of retrieval precision and recall.
