As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to understand the factors that influence user engagement in VR environments. This study investigates the impact of animated transitions on user experience and engagement in VR. We conducted a user study with 40 participants, exposing them to different transition styles and measuring their physiological and behavioral responses. Our results show that animated transitions can significantly enhance user engagement, particularly when accompanied by auditory cues. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of immersive VR experiences and propose guidelines for effective transition design.
