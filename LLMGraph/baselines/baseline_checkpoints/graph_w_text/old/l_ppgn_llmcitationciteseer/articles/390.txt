Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, as it resolves ambiguities between entities with similar names. This paper presents a novel hybrid retrieval model that combines the strengths of both embedding-based and graph-based approaches. Our model, HybridRE, leverages pre-trained language models to generate contextualized entity embeddings, which are then refined using a graph attention mechanism. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that HybridRE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of disambiguation accuracy and F1-score, particularly in scenarios with limited training data.
