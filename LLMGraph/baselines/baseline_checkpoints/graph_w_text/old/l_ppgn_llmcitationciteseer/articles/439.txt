Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc information retrieval, as it significantly impacts the retrieval performance. Traditional query expansion methods rely on term co-occurrence statistics, which often fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'SemEx', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate dense semantic embeddings for query terms. We demonstrate that SemEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain. Our approach is highly efficient, scalable, and can be easily integrated into existing retrieval systems.
