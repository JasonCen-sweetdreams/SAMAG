Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it aims to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. This paper proposes a novel neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuroXPand', which leverages deep learning to learn semantic relationships between query terms and expand the query with relevant keywords. We demonstrate that NeuroXPand outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as Rocchio and RM3, on several benchmark datasets, including TREC and ClueWeb09. Our approach can be easily integrated into existing IR systems, promising significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
