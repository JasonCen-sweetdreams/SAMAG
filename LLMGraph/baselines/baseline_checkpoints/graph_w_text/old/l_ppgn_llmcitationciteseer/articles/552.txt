Domain-specific search engines often struggle to capture nuanced semantics in user queries, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion by incorporating context-aware embeddings that jointly model domain knowledge and user intent. Our proposed method, 'ConEx', leverages a graph-based neural network to learn vector representations that encode both local and global context dependencies. Experimental results on a dataset of medical queries demonstrate that ConEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, particularly for complex, multi-entity queries.
