This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach, called GNN-TA, leverages the graph structure of the agent communication network to learn a distributed task allocation policy. We show that GNN-TA outperforms traditional distributed algorithms in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to dynamic environments. Experiments on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-TA in allocating tasks to agents with varying capabilities and resources.
