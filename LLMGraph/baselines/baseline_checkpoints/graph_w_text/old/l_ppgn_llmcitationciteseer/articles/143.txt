Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale data. However, query optimization remains a challenging task due to the complexity of the distributed environment. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called 'DRL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database's workload and system dynamics. We evaluate DRL-Opt on a real-world distributed database and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
