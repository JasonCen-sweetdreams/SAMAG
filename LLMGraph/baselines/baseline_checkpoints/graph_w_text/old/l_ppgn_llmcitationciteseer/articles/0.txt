Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing ERS models often struggle to capture complex relationships between users and items. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that incorporates both local and global graph attention mechanisms to capture multi-level relationships in user-item interactions. HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets and provides interpretable explanations for its recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in capturing hierarchical relationships and improving recommendation accuracy.
