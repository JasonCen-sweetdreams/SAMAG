Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to refine user queries to improve search results. Existing methods often rely on traditional term weighting schemes and manual feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach that leverages contextual embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our model, called ConEx, uses a combination of word and sentence embeddings to generate expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that ConEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
