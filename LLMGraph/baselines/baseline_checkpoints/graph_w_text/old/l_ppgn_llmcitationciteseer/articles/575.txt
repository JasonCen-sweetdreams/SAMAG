Patent retrieval is a challenging task in information retrieval due to the complexity and variability of patent documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to capture semantic relationships between patent terms. We introduce a neural query expansion model, 'PatentQE', which incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively weigh patent concepts and generate effective expansion terms. Experimental results on the CLEF-IP benchmark dataset demonstrate that PatentQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
