In complex, dynamic environments, autonomous agents must adapt and form coalitions to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a novel, decentralized approach to coalition formation, leveraging a combination of game-theoretic and machine learning techniques. Our algorithm, 'CoalitionForge', enables agents to learn and adapt to changing environmental conditions, forming coalitions that optimize collective utility while minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the efficacy of CoalitionForge in improving response times and reducing resource waste.
