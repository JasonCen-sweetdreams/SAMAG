Personalized avatars have become a staple in virtual reality (VR) experiences, but their effect on user engagement remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining how customizable avatars influence user behavior, self-presence, and overall experience in a social VR environment. Our results show that participants who used personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, reported greater feelings of self-presence, and demonstrated more prosocial behavior compared to those using generic avatars. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR system design and provide recommendations for incorporating personalized avatars in future VR applications.
