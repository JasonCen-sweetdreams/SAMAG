Distributed database systems (DDBS) are crucial for modern data-intensive applications, but query performance can suffer from inefficient data partitioning. This paper presents an adaptive workload-aware partitioning framework, 'AWAP', which dynamically adjusts data distribution based on query patterns and system workload. AWAP incorporates a novel cost model that accounts for query frequency, data access patterns, and node capacity. Experimental results on a real-world DDBS deployment demonstrate that AWAP achieves up to 35% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in data transfer overhead compared to existing partitioning schemes.
