This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model (HNRM) for efficient document retrieval. Unlike traditional neural ranking models that flatten the document hierarchy, our approach leverages the tree-like structure of documents to learn hierarchical representations. We introduce a new attention mechanism that adapts to the document hierarchy, enabling the model to focus on relevant sections and passages. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HNRM outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency.
