Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing ERS models often rely on simplistic user-item interaction graphs, neglecting the rich structural information present in real-world datasets. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that captures multi-level relationships between users, items, and attributes. HGAT leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant graph components, enabling more accurate and interpretable recommendations. Experimental results on the MovieLens-1M dataset demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation quality and explainability over state-of-the-art ERS baselines.
