Traditional ranking models in information retrieval rely on hand-crafted features and suffer from limited representation power. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture, 'RankNet', which learns to rank documents based on their relevance to a query. RankNet employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture complex query-document interactions and a listwise ranking loss function to optimize the ranking performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RankNet outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of NDCG and ERR metrics, while requiring significantly less feature engineering effort.
