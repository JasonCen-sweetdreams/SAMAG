E-commerce search engines struggle to capture the nuances of user intent, leading to suboptimal query results. We propose a novel approach, 'RL-QE', that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively expand user queries. Our agent learns to select relevant expansion terms based on user behavior, item attributes, and search context. We demonstrate that RL-QE improves retrieval precision and recall by up to 12% compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods on a large-scale e-commerce dataset.
