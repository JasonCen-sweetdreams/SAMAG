Traditional information retrieval systems often struggle to return diverse and relevant documents in response to complex queries. This paper proposes a novel approach, Neural Query Graphs (NQG), which represents queries as graph-structured neural networks. NQG models capture nuanced relationships between query terms and documents, enabling more accurate and diverse retrieval. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NQG on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in novelty and diversity metrics while maintaining competitive retrieval performance.
