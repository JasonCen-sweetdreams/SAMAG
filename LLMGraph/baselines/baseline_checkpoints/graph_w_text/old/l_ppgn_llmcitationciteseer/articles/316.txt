Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) has become a popular choice for cloud-based data management, but query optimization remains a significant challenge in multi-tenant environments. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for DBaaS. We design a Markov decision process that captures the dynamics of query execution and resource allocation, and train an agent to learn optimal query plans that minimize latency and maximize throughput. Our experiments on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional query optimization techniques, with an average reduction of 30% in query latency and 25% increase in throughput.
