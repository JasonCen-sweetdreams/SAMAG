Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment and receiving rewards based on query performance. Our experiments on a real-world DDS benchmark show that the RL-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
