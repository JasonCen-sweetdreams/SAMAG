Query expansion is a crucial component in semantic search systems, enabling users to retrieve relevant results from heterogeneous information networks. However, existing approaches often rely on flat, ontology-based expansion methods that neglect the rich structural information inherent in these networks. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HYPE', which leverages network embedding and graph attention mechanisms to capture semantic relationships between entities. Experimental results on a large-scale knowledge graph demonstrate that HYPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods in terms of retrieval precision and recall.
