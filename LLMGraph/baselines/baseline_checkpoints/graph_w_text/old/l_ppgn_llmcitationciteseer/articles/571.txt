This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems, leveraging deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in real-time. We propose a decentralized framework, 'AgentDQN', where each agent learns to select tasks based on its local observations and rewards. Our method incorporates a novel exploration strategy, 'epsilon-greedy with entropy regularization', to balance exploration and exploitation in dynamic environments. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that AgentDQN outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
