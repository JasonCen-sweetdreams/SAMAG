Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of daily life, but users with visual impairments often face significant barriers to accessing these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interactions, focusing on haptic and audio cues to enable users with visual impairments to navigate and engage with virtual environments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-based VR interfaces. Our findings highlight the importance of inclusive design principles in VR development and provide guidelines for creating more accessible VR experiences.
