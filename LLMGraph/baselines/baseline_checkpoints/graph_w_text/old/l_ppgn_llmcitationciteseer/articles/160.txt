Time-series forecasting models often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying factors driving their predictions. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable time-series forecasting. Our HAN model utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant temporal and feature-wise dependencies, allowing for transparent and accurate predictions. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved forecasting performance and providing insights into the model's decision-making process.
