Decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in domains with dynamic task arrivals and heterogeneous agent capabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn optimal task allocation strategies in a decentralized manner. Our approach, called 'DTRL', uses a graph neural network to represent the agent-task graph and a deep Q-network to learn the task allocation policy. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate that DTRL outperforms existing decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
