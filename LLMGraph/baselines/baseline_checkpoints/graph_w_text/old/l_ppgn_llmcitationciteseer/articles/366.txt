Distributed graph databases have emerged as a scalable solution for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph structural properties and statistical metadata to prune the search space of possible query plans. We propose a multi-level indexing scheme that captures both vertex-centric and edge-centric patterns, enabling efficient query rewriting and optimization. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
