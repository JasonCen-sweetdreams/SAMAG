Object detection is a critical task in autonomous vehicles, but existing approaches often suffer from high computational costs and limited performance. This paper presents a novel hierarchical multi-task learning framework, 'HMTO', which jointly optimizes object detection, tracking, and scene understanding tasks. By sharing knowledge across tasks and leveraging a hierarchical feature fusion mechanism, HMTO achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI object detection benchmark while reducing inference times by 30%. We also demonstrate the robustness of HMTO to varying weather and lighting conditions.
