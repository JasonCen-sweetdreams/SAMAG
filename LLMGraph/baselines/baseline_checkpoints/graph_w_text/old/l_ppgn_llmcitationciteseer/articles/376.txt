Medical image segmentation is a critical task in healthcare, but deep learning models often lack robustness and uncertainty estimates. This paper proposes a novel deep ensemble learning framework, 'MedSegEn', which combines multiple heterogeneous models to improve segmentation accuracy and uncertainty quantification. We introduce a Bayesian neural network-based ensemble method that leverages epistemic uncertainty estimation and aleatoric uncertainty modeling. Experimental results on the BraTS 2021 dataset demonstrate that MedSegEn outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation models in terms of Dice similarity coefficient and uncertainty calibration.
