This study investigates the effects of personalized avatars on users' sense of embodiment and social presence in virtual reality (VR) environments. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, who interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a VR social scenario. Results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance users' feelings of embodiment and social presence, leading to increased self-reporting of emotional arousal and empathy. We also found that users with personalized avatars were more likely to engage in prosocial behaviors. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to promote social interaction, collaboration, and emotional connection.
