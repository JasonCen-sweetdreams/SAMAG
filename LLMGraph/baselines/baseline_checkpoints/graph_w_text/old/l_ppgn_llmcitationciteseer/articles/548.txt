Anomaly detection in time series data streams is crucial in many applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. This paper presents an efficient deep learning-based approach, 'TS-AD', which leverages a novel combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to identify anomalies in real-time. Our approach adaptively selects the most relevant features from the data stream, reducing computational overhead and improving detection accuracy. Experimental results on popular benchmark datasets demonstrate that TS-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and detection latency.
