Face retrieval in surveillance videos is a challenging task due to variations in pose, lighting, and expression. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical deep metric learning (HDML) framework that learns to embed faces in a compact and discriminative feature space. Our approach leverages a triplet-based loss function and a hierarchical clustering strategy to learn robust face representations, which enables efficient face retrieval in large-scale video datasets. Experimental results on the Cholec80 and IJB-S datasets demonstrate that our HDML method outperforms state-of-the-art face retrieval approaches in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
