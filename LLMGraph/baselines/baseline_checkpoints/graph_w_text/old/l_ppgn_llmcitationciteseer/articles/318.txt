Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal results. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural word embeddings to enrich the semantic representation of queries. Our method, dubbed 'NeuroExp', uses a combination of word2vec and GloVe embeddings to identify latent semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. We evaluate NeuroExp on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries. Our findings have important implications for the development of more accurate and efficient information retrieval systems.
