In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'DRL-TA', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in dynamic environments. Our approach enables agents to learn from experience and adapt to changing task requirements, agent capabilities, and environmental constraints. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms traditional centralized optimization methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and robustness to agent failures.
