Conventional query expansion techniques often struggle to capture domain-specific terminology, leading to suboptimal document retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE-SD', which leverages both local and global context to disambiguate and enrich queries in specialized domains. Our approach combines a term graph-based query representation with a hierarchical clustering method to identify domain-relevant concepts and expand queries accordingly. Experimental results on several specialized domain datasets demonstrate that HQE-SD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision and recall.
