Deep neural ranking models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but their computational cost can be prohibitively high for large-scale document collections. This paper proposes a novel document filtering approach that leverages the strengths of neural ranking models while reducing their computational overhead. Our approach, called 'NeuralFilter', uses a lightweight neural network to filter out irrelevant documents, followed by a more accurate but computationally expensive ranking model for the remaining documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuralFilter achieves significant reductions in computational cost while maintaining retrieval performance comparable to state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
