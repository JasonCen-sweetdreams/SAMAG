Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but traditional interaction methods, such as controllers, can be cumbersome and limit the sense of immersion. This paper explores the use of gaze-based interaction in VR, where users can interact with virtual objects by simply looking at them. We conducted a user study to evaluate the usability and performance of gaze-based interaction in a VR environment, comparing it to traditional controller-based interaction. Our results show that gaze-based interaction can significantly improve user experience and reduce task completion time, but may require additional cognitive load and training.
