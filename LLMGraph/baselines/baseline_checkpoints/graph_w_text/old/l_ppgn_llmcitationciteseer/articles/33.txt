Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their usability and accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remain limited. This paper presents an inclusive design framework for voice assistants that addresses the specific needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying critical design requirements and usability issues. Our proposed framework incorporates personalized language processing, error tolerance, and multimodal feedback to enhance user experience and reduce frustration. A pilot study with 15 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
