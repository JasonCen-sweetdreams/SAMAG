Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their accessibility for visually impaired users remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible conversational interfaces, focusing on voice-only interactions. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with visually impaired participants to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our proposed design framework incorporates multimodal feedback, semantic role labeling, and personalized prompt generation to enhance user engagement and comprehension. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
