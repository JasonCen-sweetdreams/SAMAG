Distributed graph databases have become essential for managing large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization, query rewriting, and adaptive join ordering to minimize query latency and reduce communication overhead. Experimental evaluations on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
