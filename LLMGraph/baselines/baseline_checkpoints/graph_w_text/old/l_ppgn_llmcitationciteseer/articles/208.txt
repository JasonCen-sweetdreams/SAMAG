Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion (QE) is a popular technique to improve retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. However, traditional QE methods rely on manual feature engineering and are often ineffective in capturing semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages neural embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and documents. We evaluate NeuroQE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional QE methods.
