We present a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. Our method, GNN-TA, utilizes a distributed architecture where each agent maintains a local GNN model, which learns to predict task allocation probabilities based on the agent's local observations and communication with its neighbors. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized allocation methods, achieving higher task completion rates and reduced communication overhead.
