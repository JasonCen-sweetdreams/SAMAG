In complex multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'MALTA', which leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and learns optimal task assignments. We introduce a hierarchical exploration strategy that enables agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that MALTA outperforms traditional optimization methods and achieves significant improvements in task completion efficiency and agent utility.
