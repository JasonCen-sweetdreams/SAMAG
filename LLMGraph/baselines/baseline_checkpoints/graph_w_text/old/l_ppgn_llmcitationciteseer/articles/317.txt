Task allocation for heterogeneous agent teams is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Our approach, called HAT-DQN, utilizes decentralized Q-networks to learn task allocation policies for each agent in the team. We demonstrate that HAT-DQN outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and team reward. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario show that HAT-DQN can adapt to changes in team composition and task requirements.
