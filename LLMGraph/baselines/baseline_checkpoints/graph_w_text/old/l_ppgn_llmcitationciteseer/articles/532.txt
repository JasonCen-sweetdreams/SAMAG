In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents in a way that maximizes efficiency and minimizes conflicts. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. Our approach represents the agent network as a graph and uses GNNs to learn a distributed task allocation policy that takes into account agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and communication overhead.
