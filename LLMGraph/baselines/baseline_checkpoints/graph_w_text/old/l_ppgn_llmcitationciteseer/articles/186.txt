Traditional ranking models in information retrieval rely on hand-crafted features and simplistic ranking functions, leading to suboptimal performance and lack of diversity in the retrieved documents. This paper explores the application of deep neural networks to ranking, proposing a novel architecture that integrates a semantic embedding layer with a diverse ranking module. Our approach, dubbed 'DiversiRank', is capable of learning complex relevance patterns and promoting diverse documents in the top-ranked results. Experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of DiversiRank in terms of retrieval accuracy, diversity, and efficiency.
