Virtual reality (VR) technology has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but users often experience fatigue and discomfort due to cumbersome input devices. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction system, 'EyeVR', which leverages machine learning-based eye movement analysis to infer user intentions. We conducted a user study to evaluate EyeVR's usability and compared it to traditional controllers. Our results show significant improvements in user experience, with reduced eye movement and increased task completion speed. Furthermore, we explore the potential of eye movement biometrics for user identification and authentication in VR environments.
