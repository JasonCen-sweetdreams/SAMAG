In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using reinforcement learning, where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities, availability, and environmental constraints. We introduce a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture that combines both model-based and model-free learning to reduce the complexity of the task allocation problem. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and adaptability to changing environments.
