The proliferation of web documents has created a pressing need for efficient and effective document retrieval techniques. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach, dubbed 'DeepQR', for query reformulation in modern search engines. By leveraging a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks, DeepQR learns to generate semantically equivalent queries that reduce the search space and improve retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQR outperforms state-of-the-art query reformulation methods, achieving a 25% reduction in retrieval latency while maintaining a 95% precision rate.
