Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR systems often neglect their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel VR system, 'CogniVR', which incorporates adaptive difficulty levels, multimodal feedback, and personalized cognitive support. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrates improved engagement and cognitive performance in comparison to traditional screen-based interventions.
