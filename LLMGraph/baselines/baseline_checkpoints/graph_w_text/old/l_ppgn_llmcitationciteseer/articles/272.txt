Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with visually impaired individuals to identify key barriers and opportunities. Our framework incorporates multisensory feedback, audio-based navigation, and personalized assistance to facilitate equal access to VR environments. We evaluated our approach through a user study, demonstrating significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction.
