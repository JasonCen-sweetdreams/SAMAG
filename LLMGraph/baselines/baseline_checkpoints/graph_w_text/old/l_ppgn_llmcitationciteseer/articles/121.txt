Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query performance. Our approach, called 'QLearningOpt', uses a combination of exploration-exploitation strategies and query rewriting techniques to efficiently explore the vast space of possible query plans. Experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that QLearningOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
