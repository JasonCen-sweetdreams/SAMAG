Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-based machine learning, but scaling to large graphs remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces HierGAT, a novel hierarchical graph attention network that leverages a recursive graph pooling mechanism to reduce computational complexity. By applying attention weights at multiple scales, HierGAT adaptively captures local and global node dependencies, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. We demonstrate HierGAT's scalability by classifying nodes in a massive social network with millions of nodes, outperforming existing methods by up to 15% in accuracy while reducing inference time by 3x.
