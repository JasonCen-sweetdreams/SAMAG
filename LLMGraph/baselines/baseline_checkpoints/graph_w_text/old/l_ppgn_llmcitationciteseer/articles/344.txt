Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, but existing methods struggle with scalability and accuracy. We propose a novel approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings and hierarchical clustering to efficiently disambiguate entities. Our method, 'KG-Cluster', represents entities as dense vectors and applies hierarchical clustering to group similar entities. Experimental results on large-scale datasets demonstrate that KG-Cluster outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability, while reducing computational overhead by up to 70%
