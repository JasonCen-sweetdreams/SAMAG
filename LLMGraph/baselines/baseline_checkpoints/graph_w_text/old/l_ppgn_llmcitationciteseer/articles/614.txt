Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, but traditional models often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable time series forecasting. Our approach leverages a hierarchical structure to model complex temporal dependencies and attention mechanisms to identify relevant input features. We introduce a novel feature importance scoring function to provide insights into the prediction process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HAN model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for its predictions.
