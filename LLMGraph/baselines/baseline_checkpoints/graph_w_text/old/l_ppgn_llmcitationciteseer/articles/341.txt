In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and resources need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. We leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a distributed task allocation policy that takes into account the agents' capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate, resource utilization, and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
