Distributed databases have become ubiquitous in modern data processing, but optimizing queries across multiple nodes remains a challenging task. This paper introduces 'RL-Optimizer', a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing data distributions and query patterns. By formulating query optimization as a Markov decision process, RL-Optimizer learns to select the most efficient execution plans and improve query response times. Our experimental results on a large-scale distributed database show that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
