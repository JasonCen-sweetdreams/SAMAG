In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem, especially when agents have diverse capabilities and tasks require varying levels of expertise. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach, called 'MATRL', uses a decentralized, multi-agent actor-critic architecture to learn effective task allocation strategies. We evaluate MATRL on a variety of task scenarios and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system efficiency compared to traditional, heuristic-based allocation methods.
