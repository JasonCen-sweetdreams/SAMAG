In this paper, we present a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents operating in complex, dynamic environments. Our approach leverages distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to efficiently allocate tasks to agents while respecting constraints on resource availability, agent capabilities, and inter-agent dependencies. We introduce a novel DCOP algorithm, called Agent-DCOP, which adapts to changes in the environment and agent availability in real-time. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that Agent-DCOP outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, resource utilization, and agent satisfaction.
