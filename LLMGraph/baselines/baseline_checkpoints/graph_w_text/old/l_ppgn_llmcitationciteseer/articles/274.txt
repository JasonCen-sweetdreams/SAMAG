Recommender systems face significant scalability challenges as user-item interactions grow exponentially. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAN) that leverages graph neural networks to model complex relationships between users and items. HGAN adaptively learns to focus on relevant subgraphs, enabling efficient computation and improved recommendation accuracy. Our experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead by up to 75%.
