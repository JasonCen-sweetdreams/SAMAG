Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a popular technique to improve retrieval performance, but it often relies on manually crafted rules or heuristics. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query expansion strategy. We formulate query expansion as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn a policy that maximizes the expected retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
