This paper presents a human-centered design approach for developing conversational agents that cater to the unique needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with caregivers and individuals with mild cognitive impairment to identify design requirements for accessible conversational interfaces. Our proposed framework, 'CARE', incorporates multimodal input methods, personalized dialogue management, and error tolerance mechanisms to facilitate effective communication. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates that CARE-based agents significantly improve interaction outcomes and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational systems.
