Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a given question. We propose a novel deep query expansion (DQE) approach that leverages a dual-encoder framework to jointly learn query and passage embeddings. Our method utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively expand the query with relevant terms, improving the recall of relevant passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that DQE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods, achieving a 12.5% improvement in top-1 passage retrieval accuracy.
