With the increasing adoption of Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS), efficient query optimization becomes crucial for multi-tenant environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our framework, 'RL-Optimizer', utilizes a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plans based on runtime statistics and workload patterns. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world DBaaS platform and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
