In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks among agents. Our method, called GNN-TA, represents the agent-task graph as a dynamic neural network, enabling agents to learn and adapt to changing task requirements and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and agent utilization.
