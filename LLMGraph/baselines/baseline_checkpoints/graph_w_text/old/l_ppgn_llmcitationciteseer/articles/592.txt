As autonomous vehicles become increasingly prevalent, ensuring the robustness of their AI-powered perception systems against adversarial attacks is crucial. This paper proposes a novel approach for detecting such attacks using graph attention networks (GATs). We leverage the spatial and temporal relationships between sensor readings to identify anomalies indicative of attack. Our GAT-based detector, 'AV-Guard', outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate AV-Guard on a large-scale dataset of real-world driving scenarios and demonstrate its effectiveness in preventing misclassifications.
