Distributed database systems are increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query plans. Our method, 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that adapts to changing workload patterns and system configurations. We demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms traditional optimization techniques in terms of query latency and system resource utilization, especially in scenarios with high query skewness and frequent schema changes. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show significant performance improvements.
