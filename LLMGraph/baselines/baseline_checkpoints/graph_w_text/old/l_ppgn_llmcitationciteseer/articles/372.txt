Distributed graph databases are increasingly used to store and query large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph patterns and the distributed nature of the data. This paper proposes a novel query optimization technique based on subgraph isomorphism, which leverages the structural properties of graphs to prune the search space and reduce query execution time. Our experiments on a real-world social network dataset show that our approach outperforms existing query optimization methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
