Distributed relational databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data-driven applications, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workloads and system conditions. Our method, 'RL-Optimizer', learns to select efficient query plans by interacting with the database environment and receiving feedback in the form of execution times. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers, achieving an average performance improvement of 30%.
