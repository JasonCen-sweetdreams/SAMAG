Distributed column-store databases have become increasingly popular for big data analytics, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'ColOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages statistical modeling and machine learning to optimize query plans for distributed column-store databases. ColOpt exploits the columnar storage layout to efficiently prune unnecessary columns and rows, reducing the number of data transfers between nodes. Our experiments on a 100-node cluster demonstrate that ColOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and reduces network traffic by up to 70%.
