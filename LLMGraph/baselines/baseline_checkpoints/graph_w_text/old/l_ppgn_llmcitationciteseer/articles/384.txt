Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify their requirements and preferences. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and simple voice interactions, personalized feedback, and visual cues to facilitate comprehension. We developed a prototype voice assistant incorporating these design principles and evaluated its usability with 20 older adults. Results show significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to commercial voice assistants. Our work contributes to the development of more accessible and usable voice assistants for older adults.
