Recent neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but often struggle with limited query context. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep knowledge graph embeddings to inject semantic meaning into the query. We develop a graph attention mechanism to selectively incorporate relevant entities and relationships from the knowledge graph, which are then used to generate expanded queries. Our experiments on the TREC CAR dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
