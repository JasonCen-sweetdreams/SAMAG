Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must coordinate to allocate tasks while satisfying constraints. This paper presents a novel approach based on distributed constraint optimization, which enables agents to make local decisions while respecting global constraints. We propose a decentralized algorithm that leverages asynchronous communication and iterative constraint propagation to solve the task allocation problem. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
