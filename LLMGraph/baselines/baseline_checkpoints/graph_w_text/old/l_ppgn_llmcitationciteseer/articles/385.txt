Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to bridge the gap between user queries and relevant documents. Traditional QE methods rely on manual feature engineering and may not capture complex semantic relationships. This paper proposes a deep neural network-based QE approach, dubbed 'DeepQE', which learns to generate expanded queries by modeling the interactions between query terms, document context, and user feedback. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval performance and robustness to query variations.
