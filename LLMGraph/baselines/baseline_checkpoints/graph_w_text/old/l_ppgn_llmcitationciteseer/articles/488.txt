Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults, who may experience cognitive, sensory, or motor impairments. This paper presents an accessibility framework for inclusive voice assistants, focusing on older adults. We conducted user studies to identify key challenges and developed a set of design guidelines for speech recognition, dialogue management, and multimodal interaction. Our framework is evaluated through a prototype implementation, demonstrating improved usability and satisfaction among older adult participants. The proposed framework can inform the development of more accessible and supportive voice assistants for this growing population.
