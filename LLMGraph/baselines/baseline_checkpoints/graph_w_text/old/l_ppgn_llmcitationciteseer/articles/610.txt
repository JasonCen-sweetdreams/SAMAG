Time series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, but existing methods often struggle to provide interpretable results. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAT) that detects anomalies in time series data while offering explainability. HAT leverages a multi-scale attention mechanism to capture complex patterns and relationships in the data, and generates interpretable heatmaps to highlight the contributing factors to anomaly detection. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and speed, while providing actionable insights for domain experts.
