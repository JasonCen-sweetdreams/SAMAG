Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with motor impairments. However, existing systems often fail to account for the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a participatory design approach to developing an inclusive gesture recognition system, involving older adults with motor impairments in the design process. We propose a novel gesture recognition algorithm that incorporates compensation mechanisms for motor variability and explores the use of multimodal feedback to improve system usability. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art systems.
