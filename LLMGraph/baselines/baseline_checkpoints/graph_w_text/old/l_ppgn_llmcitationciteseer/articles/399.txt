Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults, but existing systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this demographic. This paper presents a user study on gesture recognition in VR, focusing on older adults with varying levels of mobility and cognitive impairment. We designed and evaluated a custom gesture set that accommodates age-related motor skill decline, and developed a machine learning model to recognize gestures with high accuracy. Our results show that participants with mobility impairments benefited from personalized gesture recognition, leading to increased engagement and satisfaction with VR experiences.
