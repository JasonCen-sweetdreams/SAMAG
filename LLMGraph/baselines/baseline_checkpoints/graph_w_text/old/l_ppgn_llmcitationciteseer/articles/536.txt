Virtual reality (VR) experiences often overwhelm users with complex information, leading to cognitive overload. This paper presents an adaptive visualization framework that dynamically adjusts the level of detail and visual encoding to optimize cognitive load management. Our approach leverages machine learning-based user modeling, real-time physiological sensing, and cognitive load theory to create personalized, adaptive visualizations. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that our framework reduces cognitive load, improves comprehension, and enhances overall VR experience quality. The findings have implications for VR-based training, education, and therapy applications.
