Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to optimize query execution plans in distributed relational databases. We model the database schema as a graph, where nodes represent relations and edges represent join conditions. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to learn representations of query patterns and predict optimal execution plans. Experimental results on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
