Conversational interfaces have become increasingly popular, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a multimodal approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces, incorporating speech, gesture, and touch inputs. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, identifying key design recommendations for improving accessibility and usability. Our proposed framework, 'ElderChat', integrates these recommendations and is evaluated through a prototype system. Results show significant improvements in user satisfaction, task completion time, and error rates compared to traditional voice-only assistants.
