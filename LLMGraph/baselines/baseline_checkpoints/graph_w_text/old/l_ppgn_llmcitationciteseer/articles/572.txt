Traditional learning-to-rank models for document retrieval often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HierRank', which leverages a tree-based architecture to efficiently rank documents. By recursively applying a neural ranking function to smaller document subsets, HierRank achieves significant speedups compared to flat ranking models while maintaining comparable retrieval performance. We evaluate HierRank on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in large-scale document retrieval applications.
