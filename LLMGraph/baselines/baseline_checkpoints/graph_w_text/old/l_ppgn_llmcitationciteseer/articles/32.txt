Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize the way people with visual impairments interact with and access information. However, current VR interfaces are often inaccessible to this population due to their reliance on visual cues. This paper presents a novel VR interface design that incorporates auditory and haptic feedback to facilitate navigation and interaction for users with visual impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that our design significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our results have implications for the development of more inclusive and accessible VR experiences.
