Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing queries in such systems remains a complex task. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to query optimization in distributed databases. We propose a novel framework, 'RL-QO', that uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan from a large search space. Our approach leverages database statistics and query execution feedback to adapt to changing workloads and system conditions. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
