Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. We propose a set of guidelines and recommendations for VR designers, developers, and researchers, which are grounded in a user-centered design approach and informed by empirical studies with visually impaired participants. Our framework focuses on enhancing auditory feedback, tactile cues, and haptic feedback to facilitate navigation, spatial awareness, and interaction in VR environments.
