Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a complex task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies based on the query workload and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
