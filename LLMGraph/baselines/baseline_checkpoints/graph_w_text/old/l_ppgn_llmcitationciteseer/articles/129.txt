Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop accessible conversational interfaces for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies to identify design principles and guidelines that accommodate cognitive declines in attention, memory, and language processing. Our findings inform the development of a prototype conversational agent that incorporates simplification strategies, visual cues, and error tolerance. Results from a pilot study demonstrate improved engagement and task completion rates among older adults with cognitive impairments.
