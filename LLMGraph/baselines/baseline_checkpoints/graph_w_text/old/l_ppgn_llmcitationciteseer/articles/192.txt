Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, most existing methods lack transparency in their decision-making processes, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing interpretable explanations. Our HAN model consists of a hierarchical encoder that captures complex temporal patterns and an attention mechanism that highlights the most relevant features contributing to anomaly scores. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides meaningful insights into anomaly explanations.
