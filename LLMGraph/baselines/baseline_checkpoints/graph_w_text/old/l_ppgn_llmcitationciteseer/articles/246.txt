Optimizing query execution plans in distributed database systems is a complex task, especially in the presence of dynamic workloads and varied data distributions. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans. Our method, dubbed 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that balances query latency and resource utilization. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and system efficiency compared to traditional optimization techniques.
