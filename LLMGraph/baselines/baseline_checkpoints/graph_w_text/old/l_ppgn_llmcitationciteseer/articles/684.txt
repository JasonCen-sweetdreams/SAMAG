Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become increasingly popular for graph-structured data analysis. However, their application to large-scale graphs remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach, 'HierGNN', which efficiently partitions the graph into smaller subgraphs that can be processed in parallel. Our method leverages a GPU-accelerated, gradient-based optimization scheme to minimize the clustering objective, achieving a 5x speedup over state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate HierGNN on several real-world graph datasets, demonstrating improved clustering quality and reduced computational cost.
