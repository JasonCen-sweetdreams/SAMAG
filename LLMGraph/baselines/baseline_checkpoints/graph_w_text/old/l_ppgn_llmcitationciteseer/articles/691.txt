Coordinating task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in dynamic and uncertain environments. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to learn effective task allocation policies for teams of agents. Our method, called TARL, leverages a decentralized actor-critic architecture to enable agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that TARL outperforms traditional heuristic-based approaches, achieving significant improvements in task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
