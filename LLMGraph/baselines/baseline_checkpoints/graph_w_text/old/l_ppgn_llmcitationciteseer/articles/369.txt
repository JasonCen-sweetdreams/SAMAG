Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve the daily lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing designs often neglect their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive conversational interfaces that accommodate cognitive decline. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 older adults with cognitive impairments and 10 caregivers, identifying key design recommendations for simplifying language, providing visual cues, and supporting multiturn dialogues. Our prototype, 'CAREtalk', demonstrates the feasibility of these design principles, showing improved usability and user satisfaction among our target population.
