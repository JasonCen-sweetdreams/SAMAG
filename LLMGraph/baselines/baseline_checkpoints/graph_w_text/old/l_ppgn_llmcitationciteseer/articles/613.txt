Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of expansion terms. Our method, 'RL-QE', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy for adding or removing terms based on their expected impact on retrieval performance. We evaluate RL-QE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art expansion techniques.
