Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to bridge the semantic gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel neural embedding-based approach, dubbed NeuroX, which learns to represent query terms and documents in a shared vector space. By incorporating syntax-aware and semantics-enriched embeddings, NeuroX enables more effective query expansion, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroX outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
