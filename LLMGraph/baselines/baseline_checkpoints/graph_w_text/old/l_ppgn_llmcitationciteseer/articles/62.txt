The proliferation of digital documents has made efficient information retrieval a critical challenge. Traditional indexing methods often rely on shallow keyword matching, neglecting the semantic relationships between concepts. This paper presents a novel approach, 'SemGraph', which leverages graph-based indexing to capture document semantics. By representing documents as graphs of entities, concepts, and relationships, SemGraph enables more accurate and efficient retrieval. Experimental results on a large-scale document corpus demonstrate a significant improvement in retrieval precision and recall over state-of-the-art keyword-based methods.
