In multi-agent systems, understanding the decision-making process is crucial for trust and reliability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in cooperative and competitive environments. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents, actions, and state features, providing insights into the decision-making process. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that HAN outperforms existing methods in terms of decision accuracy and explainability, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy multi-agent systems.
