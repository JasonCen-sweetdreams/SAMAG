Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the lives of older adults, but existing VR systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this demographic. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive and accessible VR experiences for older adults. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults to identify key accessibility barriers and preferences. Our findings informed the development of 'ElderVR', a novel VR system that incorporates intuitive interfaces, personalized comfort settings, and accessible interaction mechanisms. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in VR experience and accessibility compared to commercial VR systems.
