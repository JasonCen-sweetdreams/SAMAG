Modern relational databases struggle to efficiently process complex queries, leading to performance bottlenecks. This paper introduces 'QLIS', a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to accelerate query processing. By training neural networks to predict query result distributions, QLIS generates optimized index structures that minimize I/O operations and reduce query latency. Experimental results on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate that QLIS achieves an average speedup of 3.5x compared to traditional B-tree indexing, while maintaining query accuracy and supporting a wide range of SQL queries.
