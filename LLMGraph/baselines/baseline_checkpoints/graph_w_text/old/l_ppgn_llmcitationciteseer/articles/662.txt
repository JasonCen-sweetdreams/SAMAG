In this paper, we tackle the problem of distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents must coordinate to accomplish complex tasks in a decentralized manner. We propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to learn effective task assignment policies. Our method, called 'RL-MAST', uses a decentralized actor-critic architecture to enable agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing task requirements. We evaluate RL-MAST on a simulated robotic swarm scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion efficiency and scalability compared to traditional optimization-based approaches.
