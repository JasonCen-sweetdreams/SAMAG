Distributed database systems (DDBS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in DDBS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDBS and receiving rewards based on query execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world DDBS benchmark show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
