Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has gained significant attention in recent years, but the lack of interpretability in complex MARL systems hinders their adoption in real-world applications. This paper introduces HAT-MARL, a novel hierarchical attention network that enables explainable MARL by selectively focusing on relevant agents and their interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAT-MARL in a variety of cooperative and competitive environments, showcasing improved performance and enhanced interpretability compared to state-of-the-art MARL algorithms.
