Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare systems by providing personalized support to patients. However, existing ECAs often lack cultural sensitivity and accessibility features, exacerbating health disparities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive ECAs that incorporate embodied cognition principles and multimodal interaction. We conducted a user-centered design study with 30 participants from diverse backgrounds, resulting in the development of 'HealthPal', an ECA that adapts to users' communication preferences and abilities. Our evaluation shows that HealthPal improves patient engagement and satisfaction, particularly among underserved populations.
