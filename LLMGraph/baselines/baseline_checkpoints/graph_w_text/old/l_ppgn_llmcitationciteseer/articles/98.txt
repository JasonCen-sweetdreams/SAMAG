This paper introduces a novel neural ranking model, Query Graph Convolutional Networks (QGCN), which leverages graph convolutional networks to encode query-document interactions. Unlike traditional neural ranking models, QGCN captures complex query structures and document relationships by learning a query graph representation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that QGCN outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of ranking accuracy and efficiency, particularly for complex queries. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of QGCN in a real-world search engine, leading to significant improvements in user satisfaction.
