Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human-computer interaction. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR system using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that users with personalized avatars demonstrated higher levels of engagement, measured through time spent in the VR environment, and reported greater feelings of presence and self-identification. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR systems and potential applications in fields such as education, therapy, and entertainment.
