Document retrieval systems often struggle to return diverse results, leading to a lack of novelty and redundancy in search results. This paper proposes a novel approach using hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to model document relationships and retrieve diverse documents. Our method represents documents as nodes in a hierarchical graph, where each layer captures different aspects of document similarity. We leverage graph attention mechanisms to learn node representations and a diversity-promoting loss function to optimize the retrieval process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in retrieving diverse and relevant documents, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
