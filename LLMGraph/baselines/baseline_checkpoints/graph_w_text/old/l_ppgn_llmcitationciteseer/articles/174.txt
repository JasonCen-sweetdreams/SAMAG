This paper presents a novel multi-agent framework for optimizing resource allocation in cloud computing environments. We propose a decentralized coordination mechanism that enables autonomous agents to negotiate and allocate resources based on their individual utility functions. Our approach leverages a combination of game theory and machine learning to facilitate efficient decision-making and adapt to dynamic changes in resource demand. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization and reduced latency compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
