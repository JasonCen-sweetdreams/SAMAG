Traditional topic modeling techniques for document retrieval suffer from high computational complexity and limited representation capacity. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Neural Topic Model (HNTM) that leverages the strengths of both neural networks and topic modeling. HNTM learns a hierarchical representation of documents, capturing both local and global semantic structures. We demonstrate the efficacy of HNTM on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
