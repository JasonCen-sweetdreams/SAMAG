Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We propose a deep Q-network (DQN) based framework that learns to optimize query execution plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
