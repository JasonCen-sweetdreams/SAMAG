Collaborative filtering-based recommendation systems often struggle with scalability issues as user-item interactions grow exponentially. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages graph attention to learn hierarchical representations of users and items. HGAT adaptively selects relevant neighbors at multiple scales, reducing the computational complexity of recommendation generation. We evaluate HGAT on three large-scale datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in recommendation accuracy, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
