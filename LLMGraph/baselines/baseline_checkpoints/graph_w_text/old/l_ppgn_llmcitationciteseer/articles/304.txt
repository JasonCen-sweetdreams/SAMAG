In large-scale information retrieval systems, query performance is critical for user satisfaction. This paper presents a novel document clustering approach that incorporates proximity awareness to improve query response times. By grouping documents based on their spatial proximity, our method reduces the search space and enables more efficient query processing. We evaluate our approach on a large web corpus and demonstrate significant improvements in query latency and throughput compared to traditional clustering methods. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to variations in query distribution and can be adapted to different indexing strategies.
