Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexities of data distribution and network latency. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on the system's dynamics and query workload. Our approach, called QOPT-RL, leverages a combination of exploration-exploitation strategies and graph-based representation of query plans to efficiently optimize queries. Experimental results on a real-world DDS dataset show that QOPT-RL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
