Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for businesses to make timely decisions. However, query optimization for these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel column-store indexing technique, 'CSI-RT', which leverages the characteristics of real-time data to improve query performance. CSI-RT uses a hybrid indexing approach that combines traditional B-tree indexing with a column-store layout, allowing for efficient query processing and reduced storage costs. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that CSI-RT outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 30% in query response time and 25% in storage efficiency.
