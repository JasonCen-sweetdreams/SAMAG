The increasing volume and velocity of time-series data pose significant challenges for efficient indexing and query processing. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, called TS-Index, specifically designed for modern storage devices such as SSDs and NVMes. TS-Index leverages the inherent properties of time-series data and the parallelism of modern storage devices to achieve significant performance improvements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-Index through an exhaustive evaluation on various real-world datasets, showcasing up to 5x faster query execution and 3x better storage efficiency compared to existing indexing techniques.
