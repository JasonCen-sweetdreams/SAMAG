This paper presents a human-centered design approach for developing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) that provide mental health support to individuals. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify the key requirements and preferences of users. Our findings highlight the importance of emotional expression, empathy, and nonverbal cues in ECAs. We propose a novel framework, 'MentalHealthBot', which integrates machine learning-based sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and computer vision-based facial expression recognition to create a personalized and empathetic conversational experience. Our evaluation shows that MentalHealthBot significantly improves user engagement and satisfaction compared to text-based chatbots.
