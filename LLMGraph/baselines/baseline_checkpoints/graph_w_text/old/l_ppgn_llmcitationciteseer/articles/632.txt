Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but the role of embodiment and gestural interaction in shaping user experience remains understudied. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the effects of embodied cognition and gestural input on user engagement, cognitive load, and sense of presence in VR. Our results show that embodiment significantly enhances user experience, particularly when combined with gestural interaction. We also identify key design implications for VR systems, highlighting the importance of considering the interplay between bodily experience and interface design.
