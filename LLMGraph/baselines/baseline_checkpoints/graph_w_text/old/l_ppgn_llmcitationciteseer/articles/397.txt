Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) to enhance the retrieval performance. However, selecting relevant expansion terms and weighing their importance remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'ConceptEmbed', which leverages deep learning-based concept embeddings to model the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Our method learns to represent queries and documents as dense vectors, enabling efficient computation of semantic similarities. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConceptEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
