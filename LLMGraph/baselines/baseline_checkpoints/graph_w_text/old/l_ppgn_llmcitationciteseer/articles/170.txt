The increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads necessitates the development of efficient coordination strategies to minimize congestion and improve safety. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinating AVs at intersections. Our approach, called 'MAVI', utilizes a graph neural network to represent the dynamic environment and a decentralized actor-critic algorithm to learn optimal policies for each AV. Experimental results using a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate that MAVI outperforms traditional traffic signal control methods, reducing congestion by up to 35% and collision rates by up to 25%
