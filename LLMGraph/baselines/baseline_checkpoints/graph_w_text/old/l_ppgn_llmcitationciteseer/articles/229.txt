Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but gesture recognition in VR remains a challenging task. This paper explores the concept of embodiment in VR-based gesture recognition, examining how users' sense of body ownership and agency affects their gesture execution and recognition accuracy. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR system and machine learning-based gesture recognition framework. Our results show that embodying users in VR avatars significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy, particularly for complex gestures. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more effective and inclusive VR-based gesture recognition systems.
