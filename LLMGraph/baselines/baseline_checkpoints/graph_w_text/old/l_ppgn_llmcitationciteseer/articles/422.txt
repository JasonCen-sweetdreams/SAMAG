Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance for multiple tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'TenantAware', which leverages machine learning-based performance modeling and adaptive resource allocation to minimize query latency and improve overall system throughput. We evaluate TenantAware on a real-world DBaaS system and demonstrate significant improvements in query response times and resource utilization compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
