Individuals with dyslexia often face significant barriers when interacting with digital interfaces, which can exacerbate existing literacy challenges. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a novel multimodal interface, 'DysRead', tailored to the needs of individuals with dyslexia. DysRead incorporates speech-driven text entry, visualizations of phonetic patterns, and personalized feedback mechanisms to facilitate more accessible and engaging reading experiences. Our user study with 20 participants with dyslexia reveals significant improvements in reading comprehension and user satisfaction compared to traditional text-based interfaces.
