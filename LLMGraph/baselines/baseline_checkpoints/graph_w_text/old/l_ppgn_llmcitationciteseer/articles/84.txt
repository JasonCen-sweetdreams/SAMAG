In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often involve complex interactions and unclear influences. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in such settings. Our HAN model learns to identify and weight relevant features from both local and global perspectives, allowing for interpretable agent interactions. We evaluate our approach on a real-world traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved decision quality and increased transparency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
