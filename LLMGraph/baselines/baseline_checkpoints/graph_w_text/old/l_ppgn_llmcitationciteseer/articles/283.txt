Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it significantly affects the retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion approach using deep neural networks, which learns to generate expansion terms from a large corpus of text data. Our approach leverages a combination of word embeddings and recurrent neural networks to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in mean average precision.
