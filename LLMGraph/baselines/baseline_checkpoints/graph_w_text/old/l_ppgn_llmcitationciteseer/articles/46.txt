Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interaction design often neglects the needs of older adults, who may struggle with speech recognition, auditory feedback, or visual cues. This paper presents a multimodal interaction study, where we investigate the effects of adaptable input modes, personalized feedback, and age-specific interface customizations on the usability and satisfaction of voice assistants among older adults. Our results show that a hybrid approach combining speech, gesture, and visual input can significantly improve task completion rates, reduce errors, and enhance user experience for this demographic.
