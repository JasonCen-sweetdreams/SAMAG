In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel framework that combines evolutionary game theory with cooperative game theory to allocate tasks to agents. We model agent interactions as an evolutionary game and use the Nash bargaining solution to allocate tasks based on agents' capabilities and preferences. Our approach is evaluated in a simulated disaster response scenario, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and agent satisfaction. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the framework's convergence properties and robustness to agent failures.
