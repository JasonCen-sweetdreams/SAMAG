As robots become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, understanding the factors that influence social trust in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial. This study investigates the role of embodiment in shaping trust perceptions in HRI. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment where participants interacted with a robot in either a embodied (anthropomorphic) or non-embodied (screen-based) form. Our results show that embodied robots elicit higher trust ratings and more positive social attributions compared to non-embodied robots. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of trustworthy robots and highlight future research directions.
