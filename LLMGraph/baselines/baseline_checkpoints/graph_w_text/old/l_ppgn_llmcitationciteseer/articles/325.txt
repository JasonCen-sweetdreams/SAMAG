Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle with query formulation, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, dubbed 'NeuroQE'. We leverage a transformer-based architecture to learn semantic relationships between query terms and document contents, generating a set of expanded query terms that better capture user intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
