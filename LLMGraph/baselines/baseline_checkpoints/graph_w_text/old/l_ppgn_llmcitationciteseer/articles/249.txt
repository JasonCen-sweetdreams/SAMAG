Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used to handle large-scale data processing, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents an adaptive indexing technique, 'AdaptIX', which dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distributions. We develop a cost-based optimization framework that considers both query complexity and data locality, and demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional indexing methods. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup show that AdaptIX reduces query latency by up to 40% while maintaining query accuracy.
