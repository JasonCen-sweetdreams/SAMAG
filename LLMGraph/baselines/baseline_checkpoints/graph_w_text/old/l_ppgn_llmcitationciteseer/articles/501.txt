Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph data and the distributed nature of the system. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
