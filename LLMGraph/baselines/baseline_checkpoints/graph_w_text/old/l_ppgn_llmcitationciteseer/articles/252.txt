In this paper, we tackle the problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and resources need to collaborate to achieve complex goals. We propose a novel distributed constraint optimization framework that enables agents to coordinate their actions and allocate tasks efficiently. Our approach leverages constraint programming techniques to model the task allocation problem and uses a decentralized optimization algorithm to find near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead compared to existing methods.
