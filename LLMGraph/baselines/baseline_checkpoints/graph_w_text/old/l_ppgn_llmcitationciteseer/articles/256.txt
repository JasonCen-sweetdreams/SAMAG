In multi-agent systems, forming effective coalitions is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, uncertainty in agent preferences can lead to inefficient coalitions. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'Uncertainty-Aware Coalition Formation' (UACF), which integrates probabilistic graphical models with distributed constraint optimization techniques. UACF enables agents to reason about uncertain preferences and form coalitions that maximize expected utility. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that UACF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of coalition quality and computational efficiency.
