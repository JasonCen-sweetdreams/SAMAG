Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to creating accessible conversational interfaces for this population. We conducted co-design workshops with older adults to identify their needs and preferences, and developed a set of design guidelines for inclusive conversational interfaces. Our evaluation of a prototype conversational agent demonstrates significant improvements in usability and user experience for older adults. Our work contributes to a more inclusive and accessible HCI, and highlights the importance of involving older adults in the design process.
