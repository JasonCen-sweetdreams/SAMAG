Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks, but often require large amounts of labeled data. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention-based GNN framework for semi-supervised node classification, which leverages both labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach uses a novel hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant neighbors and capture complex dependencies between nodes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several benchmark graph datasets, showing improved performance compared to existing semi-supervised GNN methods.
