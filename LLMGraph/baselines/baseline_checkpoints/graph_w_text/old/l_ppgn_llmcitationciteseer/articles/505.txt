Faceted search is a crucial component of modern information retrieval systems, but its query efficiency remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'FacetRank', which learns to optimize query execution plans for faceted search. By integrating a deep neural network with a traditional ranking function, FacetRank predicts the most relevant facets and optimizes the query execution order. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that FacetRank reduces query latency by up to 30% while maintaining retrieval effectiveness.
