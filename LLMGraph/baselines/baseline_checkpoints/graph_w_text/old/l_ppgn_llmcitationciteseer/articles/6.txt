Distributed databases have become ubiquitous in modern data processing, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the benefits of traditional tree-based indexing and hash-based indexing. Our approach, called 'HybriX', adaptively selects the most suitable indexing strategy for each query based on the data distribution and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate that HybriX reduces query latency by up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques while maintaining a low storage overhead.
