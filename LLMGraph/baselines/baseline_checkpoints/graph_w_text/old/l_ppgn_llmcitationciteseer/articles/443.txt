Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, as graph sizes grow, query performance becomes a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework for scalable graph database systems, focusing on subgraph matching and graph pattern mining queries. We introduce a set of rewrite rules that leverage graph structural properties to reduce query complexity, and develop a cost-based optimizer that selects the most efficient query plan. Experimental results on real-world graphs demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimizers.
