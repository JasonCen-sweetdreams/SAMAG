Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. We propose a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and fuse their representations. Our HAN model consists of two stages: intra-modal attention, which captures local patterns within each modality, and inter-modal attention, which integrates information across modalities. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal inputs, achieving an accuracy of 83.2%.
