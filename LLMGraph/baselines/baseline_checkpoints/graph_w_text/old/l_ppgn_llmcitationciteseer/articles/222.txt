Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to the growing need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (H-GAT) framework for explainable recommendation systems. Our approach leverages the strengths of graph attention networks to model complex user-item relationships and incorporates hierarchical modeling to capture both local and global patterns in the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of H-GAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing interpretable explanations for the recommended items.
