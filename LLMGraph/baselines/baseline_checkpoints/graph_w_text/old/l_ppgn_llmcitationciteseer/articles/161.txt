Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) for ERS, which leverages the hierarchical structure of user-item interactions to generate personalized explanations. HGAN consists of a graph attention layer that captures complex relationships between users and items, followed by a hierarchical attention layer that generates explanations at multiple levels of abstraction. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
