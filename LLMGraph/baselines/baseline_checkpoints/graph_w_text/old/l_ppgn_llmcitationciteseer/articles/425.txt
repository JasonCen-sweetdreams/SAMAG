Dynamic graphs, where nodes and edges change over time, are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Node classification in such graphs is challenging due to the evolving graph structure and node features. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that leverages both node and graph-level attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies and structural changes. We evaluate HGAT on multiple dynamic graph datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we provide theoretical analysis on the expressiveness and computational complexity of HGAT.
