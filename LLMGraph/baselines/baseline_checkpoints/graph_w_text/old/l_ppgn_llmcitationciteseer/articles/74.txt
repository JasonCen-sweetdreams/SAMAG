Individuals with motor impairments face significant barriers when interacting with gesture-based interfaces. This paper presents a novel approach to designing personalized gesture recognition systems that adapt to the unique abilities and limitations of each user. Our system, ' GestureFit', utilizes a machine learning-based framework to learn the user's gesture patterns and generate customized interfaces that optimize accuracy and usability. We evaluate GestureFit through a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to standard, one-size-fits-all approaches.
