Virtual reality (VR) experiences are increasingly prevalent, but user engagement remains a significant concern. This paper presents an emotive avatar framework, 'EmpathyBot', which leverages machine learning-driven facial expression analysis to create personalized, affective responses in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, demonstrating that EmpathyBot significantly improves user engagement, emotional connection, and overall VR experience compared to traditional, non-emotive avatar designs. Our findings have implications for the design of future VR systems, enabling more immersive and empathetic human-computer interactions.
