The proliferation of digital content has created an urgent need for efficient and scalable information retrieval systems. This paper presents a novel document embedding technique, 'DocSpark', which leverages a combination of semantic and structural features to capture the nuanced relationships between documents. Our experiments on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that DocSpark achieves state-of-the-art performance in document similarity tasks while reducing the dimensionality of the feature space by an order of magnitude. We further show that DocSpark can be seamlessly integrated with existing retrieval models, facilitating efficient querying and indexing of massive document collections.
