In distributed database systems, query optimization is crucial for minimizing response times and reducing resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database system. Our approach leverages a combination of exploration-exploitation strategies and a customized reward function to adapt to changing query workloads. Experimental results on a real-world benchmark dataset demonstrate that our RL-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
