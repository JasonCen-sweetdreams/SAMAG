Cooperative agents in multi-agent systems often require efficient task allocation mechanisms to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach, called Decentralized Task Allocation via Multi-Agent Q-Networks (DTAMQN), enables agents to learn from local observations and communicate with neighbors to converge on task assignments that maximize system-wide rewards. We evaluate DTAMQN in a simulated logistics domain and demonstrate improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to baseline methods.
