In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient assignment of tasks to agents to maximize system performance. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn efficient task assignment strategies. Our approach, called 'DRL-TA', uses a decentralized actor-critic architecture that enables agents to learn from their local observations and communicate with each other to achieve global optimality. We evaluate DRL-TA on a range of task allocation scenarios and demonstrate significant improvements in system performance compared to traditional centralized approaches.
