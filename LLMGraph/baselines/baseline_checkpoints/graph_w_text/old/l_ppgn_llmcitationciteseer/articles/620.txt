As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, human-robot collaboration in VR environments is garnering attention. This paper investigates the role of embodiment in shaping human trust and performance in virtual co-working scenarios. We designed a within-subjects experiment where participants collaborated with a robot in a VR factory assembly task under three embodiment conditions: no embodiment, virtual embodiment, and physical embodiment. Our results show that physical embodiment significantly enhances human trust and task efficiency, while virtual embodiment yields intermediate effects. We discuss implications for VR-based human-robot collaboration and provide recommendations for future research.
