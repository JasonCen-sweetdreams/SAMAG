Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it significantly affects the quality of search results. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'QNRM', which efficiently expands queries by learning to rank and select relevant terms from a large vocabulary. Our approach combines a neural query encoder with a term ranking module, allowing for accurate and efficient query expansion. Experimental results on several IR benchmark datasets demonstrate that QNRM outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and query execution time.
