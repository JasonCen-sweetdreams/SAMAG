Hierarchical clustering is a widely used technique for image dataset organization, but its computational complexity grows exponentially with dataset size. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepHClust', which leverages deep neural networks to learn compact and hierarchical representations of images. By combining the strengths of convolutional neural networks and density-based clustering, DeepHClust achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance on large-scale image datasets while reducing computational time by an order of magnitude. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in discovering meaningful image clusters and facilitating image retrieval tasks.
