Voice-based assistants have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, these systems often fail to account for the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CARE', a voice-based assistant tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with caregivers and individuals with cognitive impairments to inform the design of CARE's conversational interface, which incorporates simplification strategies, error tolerance, and multimodal feedback. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice-based assistants.
