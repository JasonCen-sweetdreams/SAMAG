This paper presents EyeGazePath, a novel eye-tracking approach that leverages machine learning to predict and facilitate efficient web browsing. By analyzing users' eye movement patterns, our system identifies the most likely click targets and enables rapid navigation through web pages. We evaluate EyeGazePath using a large-scale user study and demonstrate significant reductions in browsing time and cognitive load. Our approach has implications for improving web accessibility and enhancing overall user experience.
