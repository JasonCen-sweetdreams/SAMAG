This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed an experiment to investigate how users' bodily experiences influence their cognitive processes when interacting with virtual objects. Our results show that participants who used gestures to manipulate virtual objects exhibited improved cognitive recall and spatial reasoning compared to those who used traditional controller-based input. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR interfaces that leverage embodied cognition to enhance user experience and performance.
