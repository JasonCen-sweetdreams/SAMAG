Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a complex task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called RLOpt, uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan from a large space of possible plans. We evaluate RLOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional query optimization techniques. Our approach is scalable, flexible, and can adapt to changing database workloads, making it a promising solution for distributed relational databases.
