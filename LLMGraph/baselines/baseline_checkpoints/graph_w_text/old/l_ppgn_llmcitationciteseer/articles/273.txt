Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing technique, called 'GraphIQ', which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to efficiently prune the search space and reduce query latency. Our experiments on a cluster of 16 nodes demonstrate that GraphIQ outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3.5x, while maintaining a competitive overhead in terms of index construction and maintenance.
