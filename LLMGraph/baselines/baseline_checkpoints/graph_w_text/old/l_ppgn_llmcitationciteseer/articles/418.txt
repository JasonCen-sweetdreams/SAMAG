This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing gesture-based interfaces accessible to older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants to identify the challenges and limitations of existing gesture recognition systems. Our proposed framework, 'EasyGesture', incorporates a novel machine learning-based gesture recognition algorithm that adapts to individual variations in motor abilities. We also developed a set of design guidelines for creating accessible and intuitive gesture-based interfaces. Results from a usability evaluation demonstrate that EasyGesture significantly improves the interaction experience for older adults with motor impairments, enabling them to successfully complete tasks with higher accuracy and confidence.
