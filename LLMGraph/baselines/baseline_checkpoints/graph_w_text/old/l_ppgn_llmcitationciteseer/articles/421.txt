In multi-agent systems, effective task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework, 'DTRL-Alloc', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal allocation strategies. DTRL-Alloc utilizes a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn task-specific allocation policies. We evaluate our approach on a series of simulated scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion efficiency and adaptability to dynamic environments compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
