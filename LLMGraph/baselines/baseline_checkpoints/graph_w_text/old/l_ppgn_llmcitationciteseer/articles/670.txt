Multi-agent systems often rely on graph neural networks to model complex interactions between agents. However, existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand how agents cooperate. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple levels to reveal the hierarchical relationships between agents. Our approach enables the identification of key agents and their roles in the cooperation process. Experimental results on a multi-agent robotics dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of cooperation efficiency and explainability.
