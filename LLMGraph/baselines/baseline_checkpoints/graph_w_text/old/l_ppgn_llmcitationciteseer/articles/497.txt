With the increasing adoption of cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms, multi-tenancy has become a crucial aspect to ensure efficient resource utilization. However, query optimization in such environments remains a significant challenge due to the varying workload characteristics of different tenants. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MT-Opt', which leverages machine learning-based models to predict query execution times and adaptively adjusts the query plan to minimize resource contention. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world DBaaS platform shows that MT-Opt achieves an average query response time reduction of 35% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
