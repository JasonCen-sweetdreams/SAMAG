Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by user experience issues. This paper explores the role of personalization in enhancing user experience in VR. We designed and conducted a user study to investigate the impact of personalized visual and audio cues on user engagement, satisfaction, and cognitive load. Our results show that personalized VR experiences lead to significant improvements in user satisfaction and reduced cognitive load, particularly for users with prior VR experience. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of personalized VR systems and highlight avenues for future research.
