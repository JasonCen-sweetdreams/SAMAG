Deep web databases pose significant challenges to traditional information retrieval techniques due to their scale and heterogeneity. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-DW', which leverages both semantic and syntactic features to generate effective query refinements. HQE-DW uses a multi-layered architecture to capture both local and global dependencies in query-document relationships, enabling more precise retrieval of relevant documents. Experiments on a large-scale deep web dataset demonstrate that HQE-DW outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness.
