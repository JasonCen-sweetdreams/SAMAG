Few-shot image classification remains a challenging task in machine learning, requiring models to adapt quickly to new classes with limited training data. This paper proposes a hierarchical meta-learning approach, 'HierML', which leverages a two-level hierarchy of meta-learners to improve adaptability and transferability. The first level consists of task-specific meta-learners, while the second level comprises a higher-level meta-learner that aggregates knowledge across tasks. We evaluate HierML on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in few-shot classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
