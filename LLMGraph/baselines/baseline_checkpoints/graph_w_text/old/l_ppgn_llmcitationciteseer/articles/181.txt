Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but current VR interfaces often exacerbate their difficulties. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible VR interfaces for this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 older adults with cognitive impairments, using think-aloud protocols and cognitive walkthroughs to identify interface challenges. Our findings informed the development of a novel VR interface, 'CognitiveEase', which incorporates simplified navigation, visual cues, and audio feedback. A usability evaluation with 15 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing VR interfaces.
