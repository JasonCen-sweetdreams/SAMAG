Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a crucial step in this process, as it helps to refine the query and improve retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion approach using deep neural networks, which learns to generate expanded queries that capture the semantic context of the original query. Our approach leverages a combination of word embeddings and attention mechanisms to identify relevant terms and phrases, and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval performance over traditional query expansion techniques. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our approach.
