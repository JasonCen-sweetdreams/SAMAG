Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies heavily on the efficient retrieval of relevant passages from a massive corpus. This paper presents a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) framework that significantly improves passage retrieval efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy. HDR leverages a two-stage retrieval process, where a coarse-grained retrieval model is used to select a subset of passages, followed by a fine-grained model that reranks the selected passages using dense embeddings. Our experiments on several ODQA datasets demonstrate that HDR achieves a 3x speedup in retrieval time while maintaining comparable accuracy to existing state-of-the-art methods.
