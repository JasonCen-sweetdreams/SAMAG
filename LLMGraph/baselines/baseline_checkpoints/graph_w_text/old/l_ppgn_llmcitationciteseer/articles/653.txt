The proliferation of IoT devices has generated a vast amount of sensor data, necessitating efficient anomaly detection methods. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach, 'HSCAN', which leverages a multi-resolution representation of the data to identify anomalies at multiple scales. Our method uses a density-based clustering algorithm to group similar data points and then applies a probabilistic anomaly scoring function to identify outliers. Experimental results on several real-world IoT datasets demonstrate that HSCAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
