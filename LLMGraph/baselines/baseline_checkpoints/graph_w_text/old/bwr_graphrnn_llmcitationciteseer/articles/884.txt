Distributed databases have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'JoinOpt', a novel AI-driven approach for join order selection in distributed query optimization. JoinOpt leverages a graph neural network to model the query plan space and learns to predict the optimal join order based on query characteristics and database statistics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that JoinOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, reducing query execution time by up to 40% and improving scalability in distributed environments.
