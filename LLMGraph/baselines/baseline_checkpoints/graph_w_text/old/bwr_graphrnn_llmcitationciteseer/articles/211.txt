Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing ERS models often rely on simplistic user-item interaction graphs, neglecting intricate relationships between users and items. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) for ERS. HAGNN incorporates multi-level attention mechanisms to capture hierarchical dependencies in user-item graphs, generating personalized explanations for recommended items. Our experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art ERS models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
