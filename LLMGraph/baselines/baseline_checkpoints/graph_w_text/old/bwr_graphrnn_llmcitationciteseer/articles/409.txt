Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in information retrieval (IR). Query expansion (QE) techniques aim to improve retrieval performance by augmenting the original query with relevant terms. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. Our model incorporates a novel attention mechanism that adapts to the context of the query and document, enabling more effective term selection and weighting. Experimental results on the TREC Ad-Hoc dataset demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, particularly in cases where the original query is short or ambiguous.
