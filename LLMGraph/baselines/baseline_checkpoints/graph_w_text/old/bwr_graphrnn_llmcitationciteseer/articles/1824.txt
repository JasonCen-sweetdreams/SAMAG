In distributed multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and interpretable decision-making. This paper introduces HANA, a novel hierarchical attention network that learns to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, preferences, and contextual information. HANA employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant agent features and task requirements, enabling explainable and adaptive task allocation. Experimental results on a realistic disaster response scenario demonstrate that HANA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and interpretability.
