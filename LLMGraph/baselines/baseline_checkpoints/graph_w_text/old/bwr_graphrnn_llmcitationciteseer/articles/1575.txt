As the global population ages, there is a growing need to design accessible interfaces that cater to older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents 'Easy Gesture', a novel gesture-based interface that leverages machine learning to recognize and adapt to the unique abilities of older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, aged 65-85, to evaluate the effectiveness of Easy Gesture in reducing cognitive load and improving task completion rates. Our results show that Easy Gesture outperforms traditional gesture recognition systems, achieving a 35% reduction in error rates and a 25% increase in task completion speed.
