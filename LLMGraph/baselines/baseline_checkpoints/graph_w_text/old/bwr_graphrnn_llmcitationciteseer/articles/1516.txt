Individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder characterized by impaired articulation and intelligibility, often face significant barriers when interacting with voice-based interfaces. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyVoice', a novel voice interface tailored to the needs of individuals with dysarthria. We employed a participatory design approach, involving 15 individuals with dysarthria in the design process. EasyVoice incorporates a range of accommodations, including adaptive speech recognition, personalized vocabulary, and multimodal feedback. Our user study demonstrates that EasyVoice significantly improves interaction times and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
