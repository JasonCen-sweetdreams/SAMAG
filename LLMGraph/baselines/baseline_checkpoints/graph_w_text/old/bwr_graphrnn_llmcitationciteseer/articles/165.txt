Distributed information retrieval systems (DIRS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale document collections. However, the retrieval efficiency in such systems is often hindered by the overhead of inter-node communication. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, HI-DIR, which organizes the index structure in a hierarchical manner to minimize the communication cost. Our approach leverages a combination of document clustering and trie-based indexing to reduce the number of nodes involved in the retrieval process. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HI-DIR achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and scalability compared to existing DIRS architectures.
