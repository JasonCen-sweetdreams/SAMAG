Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train a deep Q-network to learn optimal query plans. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
