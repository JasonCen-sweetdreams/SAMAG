Recent advances in multi-agent reinforcement learning have shown promising results in complex environments, but the lack of interpretability hinders their adoption in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent systems. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to identify influential agents and prioritize their interactions, leading to improved cooperation and higher cumulative rewards. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN on a variety of cooperative and competitive multi-agent tasks, including traffic management and robotic soccer.
