Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their efficacy for older adults is hindered by difficulties in speech recognition. This study explores the speech patterns of older adults, focusing on prosody, articulation, and linguistic characteristics. We collected a dataset of 100 older adults interacting with a voice assistant and applied machine learning techniques to identify key acoustic and linguistic features that affect recognition accuracy. Our findings inform the design of more inclusive voice assistants, highlighting the need for personalized models and adaptable interfaces that accommodate age-related speech changes. We propose a novel framework for voice assistant design, incorporating our insights to improve the user experience for older adults.
