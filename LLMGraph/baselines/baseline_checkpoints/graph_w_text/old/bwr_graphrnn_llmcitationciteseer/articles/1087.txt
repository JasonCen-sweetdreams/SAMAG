Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach that leverages deep contextualized embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and document contents. Our method, dubbed 'NQE-DCE', embeds queries and documents in a shared semantic space using a pre-trained language model, allowing for effective expansion of query representations. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, especially for difficult queries, when compared to traditional lexical-based expansion techniques.
