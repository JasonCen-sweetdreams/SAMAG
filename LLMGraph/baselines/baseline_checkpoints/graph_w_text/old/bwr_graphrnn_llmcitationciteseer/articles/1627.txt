Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods often suffer from limited model expressiveness and lack of interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework for ERS, which leverages hierarchical graph representations to capture complex item relationships and user preferences. By incorporating attention mechanisms at multiple levels, HGAT provides fine-grained explanations for recommended items, improving transparency and trust in the system. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
