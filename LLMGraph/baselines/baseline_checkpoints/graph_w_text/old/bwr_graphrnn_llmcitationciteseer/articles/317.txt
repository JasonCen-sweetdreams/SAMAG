In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'HGNN-TA', which leverages hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to learn task representations and allocate them to agents. Our approach exploits the hierarchical structure of task graphs to reduce communication overhead and improve allocation efficiency. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HGNN-TA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
