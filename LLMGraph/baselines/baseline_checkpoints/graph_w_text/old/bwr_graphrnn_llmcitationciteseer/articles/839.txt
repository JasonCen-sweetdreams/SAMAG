Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern technology, but their complexity can create barriers for older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating accessible conversational interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our resulting prototype, 'EasyChat', incorporates features such as simplified language, visual cues, and error forgiveness to facilitate more intuitive and independent interaction. Evaluation results show significant improvements in usability and user satisfaction among older adults with cognitive impairments.
