In multi-agent systems, agents often need to adapt to changing goal specifications in dynamic environments. This paper presents a novel hierarchical task network (HTN) planning framework that enables agents to reason about goal dynamics and replan accordingly. Our approach leverages a probabilistic goal model to predict goal changes and integrates a plan-space planning algorithm to efficiently generate and revise plans. Experimental results on a simulated robotic rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in responding to dynamic goal changes while minimizing plan execution costs.
