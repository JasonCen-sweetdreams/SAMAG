Accurate traffic prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages real-time traffic data from sensors and cameras to predict traffic flow. HGAT incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism that captures both local and global graph structures, enabling it to model complex traffic patterns more effectively. Experiments on a large-scale traffic dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world deployment.
