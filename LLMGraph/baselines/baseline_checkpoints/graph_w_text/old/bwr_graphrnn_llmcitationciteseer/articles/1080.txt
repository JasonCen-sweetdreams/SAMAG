Few-shot learning has gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing approaches lack interpretability and transparency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that enables explainable few-shot learning. Our HAN model consists of multiple attention layers that learn to selectively focus on relevant features and instances during training. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, including mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet. Additionally, our model provides visual explanations for its predictions, allowing users to understand the reasoning behind its decisions.
