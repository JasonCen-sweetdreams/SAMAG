Query optimization is a crucial component of database systems, especially in distributed settings where communication costs are high. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and static cost models, which may not adapt well to dynamic workloads. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize queries in distributed database systems. Our framework, 'RL-QOpt', learns to predict the optimal query plan based on runtime statistics and feedback from the execution environment. Experimental results on a distributed database benchmark demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
