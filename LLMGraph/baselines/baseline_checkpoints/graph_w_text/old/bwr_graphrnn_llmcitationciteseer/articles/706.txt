In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. This paper introduces HAN-MAD, a novel hierarchical attention network that enables transparent and explainable decision-making in multi-agent settings. HAN-MAD leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent relationships and incorporates a hierarchical architecture to capture both local and global dependencies. Experimental results on a real-world traffic management dataset demonstrate that HAN-MAD outperforms baseline models in terms of decision quality while providing interpretable explanations for agent decisions.
