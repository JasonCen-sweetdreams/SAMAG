Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We designed a user study with 120 participants, where half were assigned personalized avatars based on their facial features and preferences, while the other half used standard, generic avatars. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user satisfaction, sense of presence, and overall engagement. We also identify key factors influencing user preferences for avatar customization, including age, gender, and personality traits.
