Short-text retrieval, where queries are typically short and ambiguous, poses significant challenges in information retrieval. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, called DeepQE, which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between words. We propose a hybrid model that combines a word embedding layer with a recurrent neural network to capture both local and global context. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall.
