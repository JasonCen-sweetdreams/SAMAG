Multi-agent systems often require agents to negotiate with each other to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. However, existing approaches to negotiation are limited by their inflexibility and lack of adaptability to changing environments. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for adaptive negotiation strategies in multi-agent systems. Our approach uses a combination of deep Q-networks and recurrent neural networks to enable agents to learn and adapt their negotiation strategies in real-time, taking into account the actions and responses of other agents. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional negotiation strategies in a variety of scenarios, achieving higher rates of successful agreements and improved overall welfare.
