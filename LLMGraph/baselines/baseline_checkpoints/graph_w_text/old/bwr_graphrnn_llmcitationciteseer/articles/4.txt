Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-structured data, where only a limited number of labeled nodes are available. We propose a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages attention mechanisms at both node and graph levels to learn robust representations. HGAN consists of a node-level attention module that computes node embeddings, followed by a graph-level attention module that aggregates node embeddings to form graph embeddings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in few-shot node classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
