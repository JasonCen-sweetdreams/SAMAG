In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often involve complex interactions and uncertain outcomes. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in such systems. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, while a hierarchical structure captures long-range dependencies and contextual information. We evaluate our method on a real-world traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved decision-making performance and interpretable explanations compared to existing methods.
