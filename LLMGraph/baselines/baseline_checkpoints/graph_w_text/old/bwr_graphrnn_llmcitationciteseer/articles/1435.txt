The increasing adoption of chatbots has transformed the way we interact with technology. However, older adults often face significant barriers when using these systems, including difficulties with text-based input and comprehension. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction framework for designing accessible chatbots tailored to the needs of older adults. Our approach integrates speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision to enable intuitive and engaging conversational experiences. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in usability, user satisfaction, and task completion rates compared to traditional text-based chatbots.
