This paper presents a decentralized autonomous agent-based framework for efficient resource allocation in smart grids. Our approach leverages multi-agent systems to enable autonomous decision-making and optimize energy distribution in real-time. We propose a novel auction-based mechanism that incentivizes agents to share resources, reducing energy waste and promoting grid stability. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid environment demonstrate improved resource utilization and reduced peak demand compared to traditional centralized approaches.
