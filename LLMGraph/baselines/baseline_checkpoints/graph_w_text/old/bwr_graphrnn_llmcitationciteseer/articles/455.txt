Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the need for robust fusion of heterogeneous features. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features, enabling more accurate and interpretable emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of a modality-aware attention mechanism and a feature-wise attention module, which are jointly learned to optimize emotion recognition performance. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and providing valuable insights into the decision-making process.
