This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed an immersive VR system that enables users to manipulate virtual objects using hand gestures, and conducted a user study to investigate the effects of gesture-based interaction on cognitive load and task performance. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly improves user performance and reduces cognitive load in VR-based tasks, particularly those requiring spatial reasoning and problem-solving. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of intuitive and effective VR interfaces.
