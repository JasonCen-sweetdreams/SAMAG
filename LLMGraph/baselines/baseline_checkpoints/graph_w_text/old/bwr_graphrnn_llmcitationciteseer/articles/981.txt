Neural search engines have gained popularity due to their ability to capture semantic relationships between queries and documents. However, they often suffer from limited query context, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion technique, 'CAQE', which leverages context-aware embeddings to incorporate both local and global query semantics. Our approach employs a hierarchical graph attention mechanism to model the relationships between query terms, entities, and documents. Experimental results on the TREC CAR dataset demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, especially for ambiguous and entity-centric queries.
