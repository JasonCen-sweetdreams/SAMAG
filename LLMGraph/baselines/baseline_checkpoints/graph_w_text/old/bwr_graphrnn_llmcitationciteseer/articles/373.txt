Multi-agent systems often rely on complex decision-making processes that are difficult to interpret. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent environments. Our approach decomposes the decision-making process into attention-based sub-modules, allowing for fine-grained analysis of agent interactions and decision influences. We evaluate our method on a range of multi-agent tasks, demonstrating improved decision-making performance and enhanced explainability compared to existing approaches.
