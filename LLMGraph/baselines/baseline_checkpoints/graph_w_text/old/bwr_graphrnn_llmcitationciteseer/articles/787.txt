Multi-agent systems have become increasingly prevalent in real-world applications, but their decision-making processes often remain opaque. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent systems. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, allowing for interpretable decision-making at multiple levels of abstraction. Experimental results on a traffic management scenario demonstrate that our HAN architecture outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both decision quality and interpretability.
