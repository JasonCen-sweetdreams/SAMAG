In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework using adaptive auction mechanisms, which enables agents to dynamically adjust their bidding strategies based on real-time system information. Our approach leverages a novel auction protocol that incorporates a reward function, which incentivizes agents to prioritize tasks with high system-wide utility. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of system efficiency, fairness, and adaptability to changing task demands.
