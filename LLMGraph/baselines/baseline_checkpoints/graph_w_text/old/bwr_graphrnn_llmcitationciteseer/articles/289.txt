In multi-agent systems, effective negotiation is crucial for achieving desirable outcomes in competitive environments. This paper proposes an adaptive negotiation strategy, 'ANA', which leverages machine learning to learn from past interactions and adjust its negotiation tactics accordingly. ANA incorporates a novel mechanism for opponent modeling, allowing it to dynamically respond to changes in the negotiation landscape. Experimental results demonstrate that ANA outperforms existing state-of-the-art negotiation strategies in various competitive scenarios, including resource allocation and task assignment problems.
