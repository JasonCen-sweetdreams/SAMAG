Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with either a generic or personalized avatar in a VR game. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars reported higher levels of presence, immersion, and enjoyment. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that personalized avatars led to increased user engagement, as measured by time spent in the VR environment and task completion rates. These findings have implications for the design of VR systems and highlight the potential of personalized avatars to enhance user experience.
