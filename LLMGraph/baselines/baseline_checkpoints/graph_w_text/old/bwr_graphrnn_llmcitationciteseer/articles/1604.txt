In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that involves assigning tasks to agents while satisfying various constraints. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We propose a novel algorithm, 'DCOP-MA', that leverages asynchronous communication and iterative improvement to find near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DCOP-MA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of solution quality and scalability.
