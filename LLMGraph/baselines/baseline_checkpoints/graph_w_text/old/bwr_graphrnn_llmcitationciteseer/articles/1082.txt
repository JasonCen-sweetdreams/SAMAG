Optimizing query execution plans is crucial for distributed database systems. Traditional cost-based optimization methods struggle to cope with the complexity and dynamic nature of modern distributed systems. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RL-Optimizer', which leverages reinforcement learning to learn efficient query plans. We design a reward function that balances query execution time, data transmission, and resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource efficiency.
