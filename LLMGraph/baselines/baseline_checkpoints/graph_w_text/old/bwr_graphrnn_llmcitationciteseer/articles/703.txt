Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework using reinforcement learning, which enables agents to learn adaptive allocation strategies through interactions with the environment. We introduce a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture that integrates both local and global reward functions, allowing agents to balance individual goals with system-wide objectives. Experimental results on a simulated multi-agent robot platform demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional distributed optimization methods.
