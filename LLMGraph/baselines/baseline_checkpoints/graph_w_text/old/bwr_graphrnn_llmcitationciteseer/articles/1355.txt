In decentralized multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to agents in a distributed manner. Our method, dubbed 'GNN-Allocator', learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a graph, and uses a graph convolutional network to predict task assignments based on agent capabilities and task requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-Allocator in a simulated robotics scenario, showing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
