Multi-agent systems have become increasingly prevalent in various domains, but effective task allocation remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to enable autonomous task allocation in multi-agent systems. Our method, called 'DeepMARL', leverages a decentralized, communication-based framework to learn optimal task assignment policies. We evaluate DeepMARL on a range of scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional, rule-based approaches. The results have important implications for real-world applications, such as disaster response and robotic teams.
