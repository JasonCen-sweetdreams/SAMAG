Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, remains a challenging task due to the complexity of capturing nuanced emotional cues. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of each modality to improve emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers, which are hierarchically combined to learn joint representations. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an accuracy of 85.2% on the multimodal emotion recognition task.
