Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, where the goal is to augment the original query with relevant terms to improve retrieval performance. Traditional methods rely on manually crafted rules or statistical models, which may not capture complex semantic relationships between terms. In this paper, we propose a neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuQE', that learns to generate query expansions by modeling term interactions in a high-dimensional vector space. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show that NeuQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, making it a promising solution for large-scale IR systems.
