Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or incomplete queries. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, 'DEEPQE', leverages a policy-based agent that learns to select the most informative expansion terms by interacting with a simulated retrieval environment. We demonstrate that DEEPQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as Rocchio and relevance models, on several benchmark datasets, including TREC and Robust04.
