Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between user queries and relevant documents. Traditional QE methods rely on term co-occurrence statistics, which often fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach, AspectQE, that models query aspects using a novel aspect-aware neural network. AspectQE integrates sentence embeddings, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition to identify and disambiguate aspectual concepts in queries. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art QE methods.
