Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing query execution in these systems remains a challenging problem due to their inherent complexity and dynamic nature. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design an RL agent that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the system's current state and workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based optimization techniques by up to 35% in terms of query execution time.
