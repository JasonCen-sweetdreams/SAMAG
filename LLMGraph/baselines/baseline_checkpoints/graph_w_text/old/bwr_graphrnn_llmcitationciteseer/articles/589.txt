Query expansion is a crucial step in medical document retrieval, as it helps to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'MedExpander', which learns to expand queries by capturing semantic relationships between medical concepts. Our model leverages a combination of word embeddings, disease ontology, and attention mechanisms to generate high-quality expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion methods.
