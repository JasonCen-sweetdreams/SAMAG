Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by usability issues. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction framework that integrates speech, gesture, and visual cues to facilitate more intuitive and accessible interactions. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional voice-only interfaces. Our approach has implications for designing more inclusive and supportive AI-powered interfaces for diverse user populations.
