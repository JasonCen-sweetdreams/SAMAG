As Augmented Reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need for secure and user-friendly authentication methods. This paper presents a novel gesture-based authentication system, 'ARGuard', designed specifically for AR interfaces. ARGuard leverages machine learning algorithms to recognize and classify unique hand gestures, providing a robust and convenient authentication mechanism. We evaluate the system's performance using a large-scale gesture dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating spoofing attacks. Our results show that ARGuard achieves high accuracy and usability, making it a promising solution for AR-based applications.
