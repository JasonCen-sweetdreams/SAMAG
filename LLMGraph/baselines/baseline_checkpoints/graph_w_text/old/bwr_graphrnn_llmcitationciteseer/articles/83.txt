Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or incomplete queries. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, termed 'QERL', learns to select the most effective expansion terms by maximizing a reward function that balances retrieval effectiveness and query efficiency. We evaluate QERL on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in retrieval performance over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques. Our analysis reveals that QERL's RL framework adaptively captures query semantics and adjusts the expansion strategy accordingly.
