Multi-tenancy has become a dominant architecture for cloud-based database systems, where multiple isolated tenants share the same physical infrastructure. However, optimizing query performance in such systems is challenging due to the diverse and dynamic workload characteristics of each tenant. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MTQO', which leverages machine learning-based workload prediction and adaptive plan optimization to minimize query latency and resource contention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MTQO through extensive experiments on a real-world multi-tenant database system, achieving an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
