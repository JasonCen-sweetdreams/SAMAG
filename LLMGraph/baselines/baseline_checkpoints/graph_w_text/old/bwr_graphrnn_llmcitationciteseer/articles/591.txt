In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Our approach leverages auction-based mechanisms to efficiently assign tasks to agents with varying capabilities and preferences. We introduce a new bidding strategy that incorporates agent-specific utility functions and adaptively adjusts bid prices based on task requirements and agent availability. Experimental results on a simulated robot swarm scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and system robustness.
