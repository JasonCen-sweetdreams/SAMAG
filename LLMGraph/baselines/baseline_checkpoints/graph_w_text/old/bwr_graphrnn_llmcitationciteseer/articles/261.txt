Distributed graph databases are increasingly used to store massive amounts of interconnected data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of graph structures and the need to balance query performance with resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to select optimal query plans based on graph properties and workload characteristics. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource efficiency compared to traditional optimization techniques, making our approach suitable for large-scale graph databases.
