Effective disaster response relies on the coordinated efforts of multiple agents, including emergency responders, authorities, and volunteers. This paper introduces a novel framework for multi-agent coalition formation with temporal constraints, enabling agents to form coalitions that can respond efficiently to dynamic disaster scenarios. We propose a decentralized, anytime algorithm that leverages a combination of graph-based and heuristic search techniques to generate high-quality coalitions under time pressure. Experimental results on a realistic disaster response scenario demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in terms of response time, resource allocation, and overall outcome.
