Time series forecasting has numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and climate modeling, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network, 'HATSF', which leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant temporal and spatial dependencies in multivariate time series data. Our approach enables visual explanations of the forecasting process, allowing domain experts to trust and refine predictions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate HATSF's superior performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art models.
