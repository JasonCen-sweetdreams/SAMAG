Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing systems often fail to account for their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible conversational interfaces tailored to this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, identifying key challenges and opportunities for design innovation. Our proposed framework incorporates multimodal input, error-tolerant language processing, and personalized feedback mechanisms to support successful interactions. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to standard conversational interfaces.
