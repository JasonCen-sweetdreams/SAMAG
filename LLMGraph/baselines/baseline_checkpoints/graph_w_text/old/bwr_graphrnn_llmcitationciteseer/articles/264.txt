Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the model's decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) for ERS, which leverages the power of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model complex user-item interactions. HGAN captures both local and global dependencies between users and items, and generates interpretable explanations for recommended items. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
