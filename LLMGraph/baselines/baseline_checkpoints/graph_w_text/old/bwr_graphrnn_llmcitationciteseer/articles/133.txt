Multi-agent systems require efficient coordination to accomplish complex tasks, especially in real-time applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture, 'MACT', which enables agents to selectively focus on relevant neighbors and tasks. Our approach integrates graph attention and hierarchical clustering to reduce communication overhead and improve decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that MACT outperforms existing coordination methods in simulated robotics and autonomous vehicle scenarios, achieving significant reductions in response time and energy consumption.
