Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, dubbed 'RL-Optimizer', leverages a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy from a large dataset of query executions. We demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional heuristic-based optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization, especially in scenarios with complex query patterns and dynamic workloads. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that RL-Optimizer achieves an average query latency reduction of 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
