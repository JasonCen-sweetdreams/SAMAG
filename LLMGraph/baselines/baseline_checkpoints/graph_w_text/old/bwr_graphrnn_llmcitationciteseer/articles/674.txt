Distributed databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed databases. Our method, called 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database's workload and system resources. We evaluate RL-QOpt on a realistic benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
