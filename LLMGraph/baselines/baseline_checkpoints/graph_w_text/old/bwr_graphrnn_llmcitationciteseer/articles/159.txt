Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it significantly impacts query performance and system scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Our approach, dubbed 'RL-QOpt', leverages a combination of exploration-exploitation strategies and domain knowledge to adapt to changing workloads and system conditions. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
