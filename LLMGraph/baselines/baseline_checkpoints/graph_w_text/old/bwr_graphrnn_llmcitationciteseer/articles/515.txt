Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including healthcare and finance. However, most existing approaches lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the reasons behind the detected anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to identify anomalous patterns in time-series data. Our approach leverages a multi-scale feature extraction framework, enabling the model to focus on relevant segments and dimensions of the input data. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HAN compared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing visual explanations for the detected anomalies.
