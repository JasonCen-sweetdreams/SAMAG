As data grows in size and complexity, query performance in distributed database systems becomes increasingly crucial. This paper presents 'GraphCache', a novel caching framework that leverages graph theory to optimize query execution. By modeling data dependencies as a graph, GraphCache identifies and caches frequently accessed subqueries, reducing the number of expensive database operations. We evaluate GraphCache on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and throughput compared to traditional caching techniques.
