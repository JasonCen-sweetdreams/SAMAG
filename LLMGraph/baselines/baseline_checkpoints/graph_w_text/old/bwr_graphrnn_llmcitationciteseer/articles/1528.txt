Optimizing query execution plans is crucial for improving the performance of distributed database systems. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics and rule-based systems, which can be suboptimal and inflexible. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based approach, 'RL-QOpt', that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system. We design a reward function that balances query execution time, resource utilization, and data freshness. Experimental results on a simulated distributed database system show that RL-QOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
