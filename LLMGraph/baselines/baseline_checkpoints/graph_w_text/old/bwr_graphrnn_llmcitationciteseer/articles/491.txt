Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is crucial for drug discovery and development. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) architecture that leverages both local and global structural information of protein-ligand complexes. Our model employs a hierarchical graph attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant residues and their interactions, and a graph convolutional layer to capture global patterns. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.23 kcal/mol. We also provide insights into the interpretability of our model, highlighting the importance of attention mechanisms in protein-ligand binding affinity prediction.
