Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their interaction mechanisms can be inaccessible to users with disabilities. This paper investigates error handling and recovery strategies in voice assistants, with a focus on users with visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with disabilities, analyzing their experiences with popular voice assistants and identifying areas for improvement. Our findings inform the design of an inclusive voice assistant framework, which incorporates adaptive error handling, personalized recovery strategies, and multimodal feedback mechanisms. We evaluate the framework's usability and accessibility through a longitudinal study, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates.
