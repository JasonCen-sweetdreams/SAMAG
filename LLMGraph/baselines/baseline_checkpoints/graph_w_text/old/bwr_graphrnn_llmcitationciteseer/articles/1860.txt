Skeleton-based action recognition has gained significant attention in recent years due to its applications in human-computer interaction, healthcare, and surveillance. However, existing approaches struggle to effectively model the complex relationships between joints in the human skeleton. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) that leverages the natural graph structure of skeleton data. Our approach learns to focus on relevant joints and their interactions at multiple scales, improving recognition performance on benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of HAGNN over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling noisy or incomplete data.
