Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques to optimize query execution plans. GraphOpt incorporates a cost-based optimizer that takes into account the distributed storage layout, network topology, and query patterns to minimize query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
