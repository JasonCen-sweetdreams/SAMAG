Query expansion is a crucial component of domain-specific search systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a neural embedding-based approach to query expansion, which leverages semantic relationships between terms in a domain-specific knowledge graph. Our approach, 'NeuralQE', uses a graph neural network to learn dense vector representations of terms and expands user queries by identifying semantically similar terms in the knowledge graph. Experimental results on several domain-specific search datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuralQE in improving retrieval accuracy and robustness to out-of-vocabulary queries.
