Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a crucial technique for querying large-scale knowledge graphs. However, existing KGE methods suffer from inefficient query processing due to the complex structure of query graphs. This paper proposes a novel approach, NeuroQuery, which leverages neural networks to generate query graphs from natural language queries. Our method learns to encode query semantics into a compact neural representation, enabling faster query graph construction and improved query efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQuery outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods in terms of query response time while maintaining comparable accuracy.
