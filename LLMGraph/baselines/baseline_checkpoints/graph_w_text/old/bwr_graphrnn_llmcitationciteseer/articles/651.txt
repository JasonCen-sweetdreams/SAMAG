NoSQL databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'COLONEL', specifically designed for column-oriented NoSQL databases. COLONEL leverages a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning to identify optimal query execution plans. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that COLONEL reduces query latency by up to 3.5x compared to existing optimization techniques, while also improving data retrieval efficiency.
