This paper presents a novel approach to cooperative task allocation in multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the agent-task assignment problem as a graph optimization problem, where agents and tasks are represented as nodes, and their relationships are captured by edges. Our GNN-based framework, called GraphTask, learns to allocate tasks to agents by predicting the optimal assignment that maximizes the overall system utility. We evaluate GraphTask on a range of benchmarks and demonstrate its ability to outperform traditional optimization algorithms and other machine learning-based methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
