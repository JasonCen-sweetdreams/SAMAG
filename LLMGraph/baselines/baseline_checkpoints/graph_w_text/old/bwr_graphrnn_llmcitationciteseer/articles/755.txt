Conversational AI systems struggle to generalize to new intents with limited training data. We propose a hierarchical meta-learning framework, 'HML-ID', that leverages few-shot learning to detect intents in conversational utterances. HML-ID consists of a meta-learner that adapts to new intents and a task-learner that fine-tunes the intent detection model. Our approach utilizes a novel intent-aware embedding space and a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture utterance-level and intent-level relationships. Experimental results on the benchmark ATIS dataset demonstrate that HML-ID outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot intent detection methods by up to 12% in accuracy.
