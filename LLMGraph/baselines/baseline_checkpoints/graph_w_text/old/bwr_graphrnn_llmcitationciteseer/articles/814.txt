This paper presents an emotive avatar-based interface (EABI) for virtual reality (VR) systems, designed to enhance user engagement and emotional experience. EABI utilizes machine learning-based facial expression recognition and gesture analysis to create a realistic, empathetic avatar that mirrors the user's emotional state. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction, emotional arousal, and sense of presence in VR environments. Our results show that EABI can effectively foster a sense of emotional connection between users and virtual agents, paving the way for more immersive and interactive VR experiences.
