Predicting protein-ligand binding affinity is a crucial task in drug discovery and personalized medicine. While graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this area, they often struggle to capture complex interactions between protein residues and ligand atoms. We propose a hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, HAGNET, which leverages multi-scale graph representations and attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant molecular features. Our experiments on a large-scale benchmark dataset demonstrate that HAGNET outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 15% in terms of mean absolute error, paving the way for more accurate and efficient drug design.
