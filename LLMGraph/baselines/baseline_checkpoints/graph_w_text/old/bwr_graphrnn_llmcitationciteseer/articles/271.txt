Materialized views are widely used in data warehousing and business intelligence applications to accelerate query performance. However, maintaining materialized views in distributed database systems poses significant challenges due to data inconsistencies and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DynaView', which leverages incremental view maintenance and adaptive data replication to reduce the maintenance cost of materialized views. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DynaView achieves an average reduction of 35% in maintenance time and 20% in network bandwidth usage compared to existing approaches.
