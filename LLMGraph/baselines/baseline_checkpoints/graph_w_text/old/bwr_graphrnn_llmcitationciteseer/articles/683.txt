Virtual reality (VR) systems have the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current interfaces often neglect the needs of visually impaired users. This paper presents 'VRImpact', a novel VR interface designed to provide an inclusive experience for individuals with visual impairments. We conducted a participatory design process with 20 visually impaired participants to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our interface incorporates haptic feedback, audio cues, and simplified navigation to enhance usability and accessibility. A user study with 15 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion time and subjective satisfaction compared to commercial VR systems.
