In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task assignment policies. Our approach, called GNN-TA, represents the agent-task graph as a dynamic structure and utilizes GNNs to learn a distributed task allocation policy. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms traditional methods, such as auction-based and centralized optimization approaches, in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
