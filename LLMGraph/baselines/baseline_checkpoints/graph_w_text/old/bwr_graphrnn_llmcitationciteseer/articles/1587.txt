Large-scale text collections pose significant challenges for efficient document retrieval. This paper presents a novel hierarchical document representation approach, 'HDRep', which leverages a combination of local and global contextualized embeddings to capture semantic relationships between documents. By hierarchically partitioning the document space, HDRep reduces the retrieval complexity from O(n) to O(log n), enabling fast and accurate retrieval in massive document collections. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that HDRep outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving a 35% improvement in mean average precision.
