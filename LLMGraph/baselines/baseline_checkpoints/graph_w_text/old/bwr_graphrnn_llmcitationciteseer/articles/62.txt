State-of-the-art neural ranking models have shown promising results in search engines, but their computational complexity hinders their adoption in large-scale production environments. This paper proposes a novel neural retrieval model, 'EffiRank', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to efficiently rank documents. Our approach reduces the computational overhead by 30% compared to existing models while maintaining comparable ranking performance on the TREC Deep Learning track. We also introduce a dataset-agnostic training strategy that enables our model to generalize well across different search engine datasets.
