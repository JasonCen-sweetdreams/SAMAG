Virtual reality (VR) technology has immense potential for older adults with cognitive impairments, offering immersive experiences that can enhance cognitive function and quality of life. However, existing VR interfaces often neglect the unique needs and challenges of this population. This paper presents a novel, user-centered design approach for accessible VR interfaces, incorporating insights from cognitive psychology and gerontology. We propose a set of design guidelines and heuristics, validated through user studies with older adults, to improve the usability, accessibility, and overall VR experience for this demographic.
