In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and coordinated decision-making. This paper presents a novel distributed constraint optimization approach for task allocation, which leverages the strengths of both centralized and decentralized methods. Our algorithm, called DCOTA, uses a hybrid framework that combines constraint propagation with iterative improvement to find near-optimal task assignments. Experimental evaluations on a set of benchmark problems demonstrate that DCOTA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world multi-agent systems.
