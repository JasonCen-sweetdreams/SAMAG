Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but its full potential is hindered by limited understanding of embodied cognition in immersive environments. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effects of gesture-based interaction on user experience in VR. We designed and evaluated a novel VR system that incorporates embodied cognition principles, allowing users to manipulate virtual objects using natural gestures. Our results show that embodied interaction enhances user engagement, reduces cognitive load, and improves task performance. We also identify key factors influencing the efficacy of embodied cognition in VR, including gesture recognition accuracy and user personality traits.
