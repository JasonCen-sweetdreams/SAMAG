Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval, as it helps to refine the search query and retrieve more relevant documents. Traditional query expansion methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not adapt well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'QERL', which learns to select optimal expansion terms for a given query. QERL integrates a neural query encoder with a reinforcement learning agent that maximizes the expected retrieval performance. Experimental results on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate that QERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly for complex and ambiguous queries.
