Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion technique that leverages deep neural ranking models to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. Our approach, dubbed 'NeuQE', combines the strengths of BERT-based language models with a custom-designed neural ranking architecture to generate high-quality expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries with limited relevance feedback.
