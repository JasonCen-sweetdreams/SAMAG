Traditional learning-to-rank models for information retrieval (IR) often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. We propose a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HierRank', which leverages document embeddings and a tree-based ranking architecture to reduce computational complexity. Our approach enables efficient retrieval of relevant documents while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
