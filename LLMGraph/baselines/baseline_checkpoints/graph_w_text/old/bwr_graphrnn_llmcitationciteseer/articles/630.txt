This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision-making. Our approach integrates attention mechanisms at both the agent and group levels to selectively focus on relevant information and agents when making decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a simulated multi-agent environment, showcasing improved decision-making performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Our ablation study reveals the importance of hierarchical attention in capturing complex dependencies between agents and their environments.
