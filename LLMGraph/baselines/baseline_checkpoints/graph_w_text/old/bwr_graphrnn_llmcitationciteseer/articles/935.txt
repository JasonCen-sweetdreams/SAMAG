Individuals with motor impairments often face significant challenges when interacting with gesture-recognition systems. This paper presents a novel approach to designing adaptive gesture recognition systems that can accommodate a wide range of motor abilities. Our system, 'GestAdapt', uses a combination of machine learning and HCI principles to dynamically adjust gesture recognition parameters based on a user's motor capabilities. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments and demonstrated that GestAdapt significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and reduces user frustration compared to traditional systems.
