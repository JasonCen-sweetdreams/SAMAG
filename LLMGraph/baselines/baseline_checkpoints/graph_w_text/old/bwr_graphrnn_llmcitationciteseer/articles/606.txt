Distributed graph databases are increasingly used to store and query large-scale graph data. However, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization, query rewriting, and distributed execution to improve query performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphOpt on a real-world graph dataset, achieving up to 5x speedup compared to existing optimization techniques.
