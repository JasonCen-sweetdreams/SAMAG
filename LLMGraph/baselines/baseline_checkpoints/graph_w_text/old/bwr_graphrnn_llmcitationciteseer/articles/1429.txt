The proliferation of misinformation on social media has severe consequences for individuals and society. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) for explainable fake news detection. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model the complex relationships between news articles, users, and publishers, while incorporating attention mechanisms to identify key entities and sentences contributing to the fake news classification. Experimental results on a large dataset of news articles demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in detecting fake news, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 12.5%. Furthermore, we provide visualizations and feature importance scores to facilitate explainability and transparency in fake news detection.
