Gesture recognition has become an essential component of human-computer interaction (HCI) in various applications, including gaming, virtual reality, and assistive technologies. This paper presents a novel approach to personalized gesture recognition using deep learning-based hand pose estimation. Our method leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the 3D hand pose from RGB images, followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN) to recognize gestures. We propose a transfer learning scheme that adapts the model to individual users, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 12.5% over existing methods. Experimental results on a large-scale gesture dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in recognizing personalized gestures.
