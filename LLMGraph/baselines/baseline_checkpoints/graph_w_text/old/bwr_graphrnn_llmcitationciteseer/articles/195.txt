Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments often require efficient negotiation strategies to achieve their goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed negotiation framework, 'DynaNeg', which leverages adaptive learning and graph-based modeling to facilitate effective agreements among agents. Our approach integrates a probabilistic reasoning module to handle uncertainty and a decentralized decision-making mechanism to ensure scalability. Experimental results demonstrate that DynaNeg outperforms traditional negotiation protocols in terms of negotiation success rate and outcome quality in various scenarios, including supply chain management and resource allocation.
