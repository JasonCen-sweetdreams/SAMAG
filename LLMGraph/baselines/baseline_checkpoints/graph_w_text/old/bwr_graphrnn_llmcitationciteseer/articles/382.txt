Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often overlooks the needs of older adults. This paper investigates age-related cognitive biases that affect the interaction between older adults and voice assistants. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, exploring their mental models, error patterns, and perceptions of voice assistants. Our findings reveal that older adults often struggle with voice assistants due to biases such as confirmation bias, anchoring bias, and availability heuristic. We propose a set of design recommendations for creating more inclusive voice assistants, including personalized tutorials, explicit error feedback, and adaptive dialogue management.
