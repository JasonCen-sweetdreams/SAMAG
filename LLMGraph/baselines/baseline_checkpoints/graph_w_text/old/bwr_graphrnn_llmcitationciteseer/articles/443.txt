Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant passages from a large corpus. This paper proposes a novel approach, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), which leverages dense passage embeddings to improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency. We introduce a neural network-based passage encoder that generates dense embeddings, enabling fast similarity search using approximate nearest neighbors. Experimental results on several ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that DPR outperforms traditional TF-IDF-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art results while reducing retrieval time by an order of magnitude.
