Virtual reality (VR) systems often rely on abstract controllers, which can lead to a sense of disconnection between users' physical bodies and virtual actions. This paper presents a novel VR interaction framework, 'EmboVR', that leverages embodied cognition principles to create a more immersive and intuitive experience. We design a wearable device that tracks users' bodily movements and translates them into virtual actions, exploiting the cognitive connection between motor control and perception. User studies demonstrate significant improvements in task performance, user satisfaction, and reduced cognitive load compared to traditional controllers.
