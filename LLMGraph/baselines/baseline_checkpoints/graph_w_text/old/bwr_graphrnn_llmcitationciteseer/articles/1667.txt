Recommendation systems are crucial in modern e-commerce, but their scalability remains a significant challenge. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages the graph structure of user-item interactions to model complex relationships. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively aggregate features from neighboring nodes, enabling efficient learning of node representations. Our experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world recommendation systems.
