The increasing complexity of IoT networks necessitates efficient resource allocation to ensure seamless device communication. This paper proposes a novel cooperative agent-based framework, 'CAREA', which leverages autonomous decision-making agents to dynamically allocate resources in heterogeneous IoT networks. By integrating game-theoretic principles with machine learning algorithms, CAREA enables agents to adapt to changing network conditions and optimize resource utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that CAREA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of network throughput, latency, and energy efficiency.
