Traditional document ranking models often neglect the rich contextual information available in search queries and documents. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that models the complex relationships between query terms, document entities, and their semantic contexts. Our approach learns to represent queries and documents as hierarchical graphs, which enables the capture of long-range dependencies and nuanced contextual patterns. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, particularly in scenarios with ambiguous or multi-faceted queries.
