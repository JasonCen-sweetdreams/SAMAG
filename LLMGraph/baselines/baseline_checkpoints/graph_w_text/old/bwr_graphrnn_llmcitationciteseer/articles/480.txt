In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects overall system efficiency. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework, called ADAPT, which leverages adaptive negotiation protocols to allocate tasks in heterogeneous agent environments. ADAPT incorporates a dynamic learning mechanism that adjusts negotiation strategies based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and environmental changes. Our experimental results demonstrate that ADAPT outperforms existing task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and resource utilization in complex scenarios.
