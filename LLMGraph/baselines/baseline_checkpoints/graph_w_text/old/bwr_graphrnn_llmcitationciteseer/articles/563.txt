This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach for semantic search, which leverages the latent relationships between entities and concepts to improve retrieval accuracy. Our method, dubbed HierEx, employs a graph-based neural network to model the semantic dependencies between query terms and expands the query scope using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, while reducing the computational overhead by up to 30%
