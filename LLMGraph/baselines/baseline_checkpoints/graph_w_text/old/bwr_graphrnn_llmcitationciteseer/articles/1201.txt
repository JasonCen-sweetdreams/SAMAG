Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly popular in various applications, including financial analytics and IoT sensor processing. However, indexing techniques play a crucial role in achieving fast query performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, 'RT-Index', which combines a hierarchical bitmap index with a compact representation of data blocks. RT-Index reduces storage overhead by 30% compared to existing indexing schemes while maintaining query performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of RT-Index using the TPC-DS benchmark and demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios.
