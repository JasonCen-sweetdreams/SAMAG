Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in providing emotional support for individuals with anxiety and depression. This paper presents a novel embodied conversational agent (ECA) framework, 'EmpaVR', designed to simulate empathetic conversations in VR environments. EmpaVR integrates machine learning-based sentiment analysis, emotional state tracking, and affective gesture generation to create a realistic and engaging interaction experience. We conducted a user study with 30 participants and found that EmpaVR significantly increased feelings of comfort and reduced anxiety compared to traditional text-based chatbots. Our findings have implications for the development of VR-based emotional support systems.
