In large-scale multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using reinforcement learning, where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their local observations and interactions with neighboring agents. We introduce a novel reward function that incorporates both individual agent performance and global system efficiency. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and system adaptability.
