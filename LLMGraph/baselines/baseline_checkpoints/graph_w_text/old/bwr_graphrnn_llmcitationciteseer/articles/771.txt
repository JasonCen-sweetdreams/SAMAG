Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often rely on query expansion techniques to improve retrieval effectiveness. However, traditional methods rely on term co-occurrence statistics, which can be limited by the quality of the document collection. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to capture semantic relationships between entities and terms. Our method, 'KGQE', represents queries and documents as dense vectors in a shared knowledge graph space, enabling efficient expansion of the original query. Experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that KGQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
