Multi-label classification is a fundamental problem in machine learning, where an instance can be associated with multiple labels. However, real-world datasets often contain noisy labels, which can significantly degrade the performance of traditional multi-label classification models. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that can effectively handle noisy labels by learning to attend to relevant labels and instances. Our HAN model consists of label-level and instance-level attention mechanisms, which enable it to adaptively weight the importance of different labels and instances during training. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the presence of noisy labels.
