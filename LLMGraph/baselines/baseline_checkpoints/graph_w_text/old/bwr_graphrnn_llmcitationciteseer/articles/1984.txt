Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in DDS due to the complexity of data distribution and node interactions. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design a RL-based framework that learns to optimize query plans based on the system's dynamic behavior, reducing query latency and improving overall system performance. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
