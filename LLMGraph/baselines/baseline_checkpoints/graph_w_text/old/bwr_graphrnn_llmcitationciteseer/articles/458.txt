In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to learn effective allocation strategies. Our approach, called 'DTRL', utilizes a decentralized Q-network to enable agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Experimental results on a simulated scenario demonstrate that DTRL outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods and achieves near-optimal performance in complex, dynamic environments.
