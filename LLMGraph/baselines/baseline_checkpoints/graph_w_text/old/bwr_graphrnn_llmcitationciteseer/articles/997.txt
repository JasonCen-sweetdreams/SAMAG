Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability for older adults with hearing impairments is often overlooked. This study investigates the design of inclusive voice assistants that can accommodate the specific needs of this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with hearing impairments, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant prototype, 'HearMe', which incorporates acoustic adaptations, multimodal feedback, and personalized communication strategies. Evaluations with 20 participants show a significant increase in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
