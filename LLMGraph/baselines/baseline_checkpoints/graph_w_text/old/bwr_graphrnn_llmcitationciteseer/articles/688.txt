Conversational search systems require effective query expansion techniques to handle ambiguous user queries. However, most existing methods rely on large amounts of labeled training data, which can be difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework, 'ConverseQE', that leverages limited supervision from user interactions. We introduce a reinforcement learning objective that encourages the model to explore diverse query expansions, while incorporating a novel categorization-based regularization term to reduce semantic drift. Experimental results on a popular conversational search dataset demonstrate that ConverseQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and conversational coherence.
