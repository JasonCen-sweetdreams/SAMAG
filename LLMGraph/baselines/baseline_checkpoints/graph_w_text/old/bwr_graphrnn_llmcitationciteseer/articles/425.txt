Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with motor impairments, but existing systems often fail to accommodate their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing accessible gesture recognition systems, incorporating insights from older adults with motor impairments and caregivers. We develop and evaluate a novel gesture recognition system, 'Easy Gesture', which utilizes machine learning algorithms to adapt to individual users' abilities and preferences. Our system achieves a significant improvement in accuracy and user satisfaction compared to commercial systems, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in HCI.
