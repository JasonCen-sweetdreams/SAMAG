Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called 'RL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given query and database configuration. We evaluate RL-QO on a real-world dataset and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of execution time and resource utilization. Our approach has the potential to significantly improve the performance of distributed database systems.
