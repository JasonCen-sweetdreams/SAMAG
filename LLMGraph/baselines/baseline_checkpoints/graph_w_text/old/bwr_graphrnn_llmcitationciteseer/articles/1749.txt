Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) for interpretable time series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to identify relevant features and time steps, providing insights into the anomaly detection process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods while offering meaningful interpretability.
