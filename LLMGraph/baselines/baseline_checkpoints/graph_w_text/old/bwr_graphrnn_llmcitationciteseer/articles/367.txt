Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics. However, optimal query planning in DDS remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query plans for DDS. We develop a customized RL framework, 'DDS-RL', that learns to navigate the complex query optimization space by interacting with the database environment. Our experiments demonstrate that DDS-RL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of execution time and resource utilization, while adapting to changing workload patterns and system configurations.
