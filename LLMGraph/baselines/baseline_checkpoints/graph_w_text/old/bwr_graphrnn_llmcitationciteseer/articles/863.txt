Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) to improve the retrieval performance. Traditional query expansion methods rely on manual feature engineering and suffer from limited generalizability. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DQE', which leverages neural networks to learn latent representations of queries and documents. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show that DQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of DQE in improving the retrieval performance for long-tail queries and cold start scenarios.
