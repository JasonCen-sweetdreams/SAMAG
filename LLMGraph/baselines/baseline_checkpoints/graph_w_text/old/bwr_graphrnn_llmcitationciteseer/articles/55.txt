Optimizing queries in modern data warehouses is a complex task, especially with the increasing volume and variety of data. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. We design a deep Q-network that learns to predict the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query characteristics, and runtime statistics. Our approach, called 'DeepOpt', is evaluated on a real-world dataset and demonstrates significant improvements in query performance and response time compared to traditional optimization techniques. We also explore the robustness of DeepOpt under varying workloads and database configurations.
