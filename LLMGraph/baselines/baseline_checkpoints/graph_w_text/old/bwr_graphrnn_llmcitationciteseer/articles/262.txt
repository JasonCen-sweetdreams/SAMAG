The proliferation of IoT devices and high-frequency sensors has led to an explosion of time-series data. However, traditional indexing techniques struggle to keep up with the velocity and volume of such data, making it difficult to support real-time queries and analytics. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'ChronoIndex', designed specifically for distributed databases. ChronoIndex leverages a combination of space-filling curves, compact bit-vector representations, and adaptive sampling to achieve a 3x improvement in query performance and a 2x reduction in storage overhead compared to existing indexing methods. We evaluate ChronoIndex on a large-scale datasets from industrial sensors and demonstrate its effectiveness in supporting real-time monitoring and prediction tasks.
