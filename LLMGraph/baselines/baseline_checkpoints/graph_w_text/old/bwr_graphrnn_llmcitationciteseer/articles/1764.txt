Query expansion techniques are crucial for effective document retrieval in unstructured data. Existing methods rely on manual feature engineering or statistical analysis, which can be time-consuming and lead to suboptimal performance. We propose a neural query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep learning to learn query-document relationships and generate context-aware expansions. Our approach adopts a multi-task learning strategy, jointly optimizing query expansion and document ranking objectives. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
