Ad-hoc search systems struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel neural retrieval model, QE-DocExp, which integrates query-aware document expansion to better match user intent. Our approach leverages a transformer-based architecture to generate contextualized query embeddings, which are then used to expand relevant documents through a hierarchical attention mechanism. Experiments on the TREC ad-hoc search benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for complex, multi-entity queries.
