This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation framework, HierDoc, for efficient query-based retrieval. HierDoc leverages a multi-level attention mechanism to capture contextual relationships between document segments, allowing for more accurate query-document similarity estimation. Our experiments on the TREC-COVID dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models. We also show that HierDoc can be easily integrated with existing retrieval systems, making it a practical solution for real-world search applications.
