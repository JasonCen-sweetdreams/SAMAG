Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have shown promise in healthcare interfaces, but their design often neglects the needs of diverse user populations. This paper presents a participatory design approach to develop ECAs that are inclusive of users with disabilities, older adults, and individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds. We conducted co-design workshops with 30 participants, resulting in 15 design recommendations for ECAs that support multimodal interaction, emotional intelligence, and cultural sensitivity. We implemented a prototype ECA, 'HealthPal', which was evaluated in a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating improved user experience and perceived trust compared to a baseline ECA.
