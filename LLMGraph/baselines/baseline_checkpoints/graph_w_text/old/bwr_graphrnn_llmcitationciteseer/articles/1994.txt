Modern search engines rely heavily on query expansion techniques to improve document retrieval accuracy. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages term dependencies and contextual information to generate more informative and targeted queries. Our method involves constructing a hierarchical graph of query terms, where nodes represent terms and edges represent semantic relationships. We then employ a random walk-based algorithm to traverse the graph and generate expanded queries. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision and recall.
