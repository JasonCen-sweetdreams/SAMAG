Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroXPand', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of query terms and their relationships. Our method integrates a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on informative terms and phrases, and generates expanded queries that better capture the user's information need. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, especially for difficult queries, and outperform state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
