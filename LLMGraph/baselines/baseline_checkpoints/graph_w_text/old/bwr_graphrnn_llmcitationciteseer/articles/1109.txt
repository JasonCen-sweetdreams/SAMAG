Query expansion is a crucial component of information retrieval systems, as it enhances the retrieval performance by incorporating relevant terms into the original query. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach using deep neural networks, which learns to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our proposed model, 'DeepQE', employs a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion and relevance ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
