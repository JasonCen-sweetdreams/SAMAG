Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed database systems, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of modern data-intensive applications. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on hand-crafted heuristics and rule-based systems, which may not adapt well to dynamic workloads and complex data distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our RL-based optimizer, called 'QueryRL', learns to navigate the vast space of possible query plans and identifies near-optimal plans through trial and error. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that QueryRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
