Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and behavior in VR environments. We designed a user study with 120 participants, who interacted with a VR platform using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to a significant increase in user engagement, measured through self-reported presence, enjoyment, and physiological responses. We also found that the impact of personalization is more pronounced for users with lower levels of gaming experience.
