This paper presents a novel approach to real-time traffic management using autonomous agents coordinated by hierarchical reinforcement learning. Our framework, dubbed 'SmartTraffic', consists of a hierarchical structure of agents that learn to optimize traffic signal control and route planning in response to dynamic traffic conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SmartTraffic in reducing congestion and travel times in a simulated urban environment, achieving an average reduction of 23% in travel time compared to traditional traffic management systems.
