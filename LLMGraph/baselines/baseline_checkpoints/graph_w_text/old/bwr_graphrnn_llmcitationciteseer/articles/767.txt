Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments is often limited. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing inclusive voice assistants that accommodate the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and clinicians to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings informed the development of 'EasyVoice', a novel voice assistant that incorporates cognitive support features, such as step-by-step task guidance and error correction. A usability evaluation with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to a commercial voice assistant.
