Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in DDS remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies based on the query workload and system dynamics. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
