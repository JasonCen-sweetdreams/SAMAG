Distributed database systems face the challenge of optimizing query performance in the presence of heterogeneous data distributions and varying workload patterns. This paper proposes an adaptive partitioning scheme, 'ADAPT', that dynamically adjusts data partitioning and placement based on real-time query patterns. We develop a cost-based optimization framework that considers query selectivity, data skew, and node availability to minimize query latency and improve resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that ADAPT outperforms state-of-the-art partitioning schemes by up to 35% in query response time and 25% in resource utilization.
