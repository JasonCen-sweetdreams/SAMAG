Decentralized database systems have gained popularity due to their potential to provide scalable and fault-tolerant data management. However, they also introduce new challenges in terms of data sharing and security. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for secure and scalable data sharing in decentralized database systems. Our approach leverages a combination of cryptographic techniques and access control mechanisms to ensure that data is shared only with authorized parties. We evaluate our framework using a real-world dataset and demonstrate its scalability and security advantages over existing approaches.
