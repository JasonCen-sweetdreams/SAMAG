Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various node classification tasks. However, existing GNN architectures often struggle to capture complex structural relationships between nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, 'HAGNN', which leverages multi-scale graph attention to selectively focus on relevant node neighborhoods. We demonstrate the efficacy of HAGNN on several benchmark datasets, showcasing significant improvements over existing GNN models in node classification accuracy and robustness.
