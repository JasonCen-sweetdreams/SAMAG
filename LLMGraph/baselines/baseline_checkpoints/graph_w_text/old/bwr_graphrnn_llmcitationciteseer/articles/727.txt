Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for users with visual impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with visually impaired participants, resulting in a set of design principles and guidelines for accessible conversation flow, feedback, and error handling. We evaluate our approach through a usability study, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates compared to existing conversational interfaces.
