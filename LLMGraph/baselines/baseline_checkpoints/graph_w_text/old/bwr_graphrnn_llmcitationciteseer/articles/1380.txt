In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the agent-agent interactions as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn the task allocation policy. Our approach takes into account the agents' capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints, ensuring efficient and adaptive task allocation. We evaluate our method on a variety of scenarios, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
