Multi-label node classification is a fundamental task in graph-based learning, where each node can be associated with multiple labels. Existing methods often rely on flat graph attention mechanisms, which may not effectively capture hierarchical relationships between nodes. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages a multi-scale graph attention mechanism to model node relationships at different granularities. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of macro-F1 score and label-wise accuracy.
