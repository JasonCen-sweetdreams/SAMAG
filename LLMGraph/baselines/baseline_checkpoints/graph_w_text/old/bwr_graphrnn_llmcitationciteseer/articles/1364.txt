Multi-agent systems require efficient decision-making strategies that can operate in complex, dynamic environments. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent settings. Our approach combines graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical reasoning to model agent interactions and contextual dependencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN on a series of benchmarks, showcasing improved decision accuracy and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our work has implications for real-world applications such as autonomous vehicle coordination and smart grid management.
