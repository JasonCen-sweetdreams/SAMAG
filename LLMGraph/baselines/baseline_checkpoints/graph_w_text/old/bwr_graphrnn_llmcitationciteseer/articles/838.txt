In medical information retrieval, the accuracy of query expansion techniques significantly impacts search results. This paper proposes a novel graph-based keyword embedding approach, MedGraph, which leverages the semantic relationships between medical concepts to improve query expansion. We represent keywords as nodes in a graph and learn their embeddings by optimizing a novel objective function that combines cosine similarity and graph-based regularization. Experimental results on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset demonstrate that MedGraph outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
