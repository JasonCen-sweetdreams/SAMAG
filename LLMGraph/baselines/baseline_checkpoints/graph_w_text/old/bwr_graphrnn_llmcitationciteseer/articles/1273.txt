Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for scalable data management. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed relational databases. Our method, called 'Distributed Query Optimizer' (DQO), uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database workload, network latency, and available resources. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark show that DQO outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
