Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents based on a user's query. Traditional query expansion methods rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'QERL', which learns to expand queries by interacting with a simulated environment. QERL uses a policy gradient method to optimize the query expansion strategy, and we show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of QERL in improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
