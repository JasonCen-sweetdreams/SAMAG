Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but traditional methods often fail to capture the nuances of query context. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'CtxEmb', which leverages context-aware embeddings to enrich query representations. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively incorporates semantic and syntactic features from the query context, resulting in more effective expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that CtxEmb outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
