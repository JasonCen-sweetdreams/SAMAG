The increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads necessitates efficient coordination mechanisms to ensure safe and efficient traffic flow. This paper proposes a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for coordinating AVs at intersections. We design a decentralized policy that enables AVs to learn from their local observations and communicate with neighboring agents to optimize traffic signal control. Experimental results using a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional traffic signal control methods in reducing congestion and improving safety
