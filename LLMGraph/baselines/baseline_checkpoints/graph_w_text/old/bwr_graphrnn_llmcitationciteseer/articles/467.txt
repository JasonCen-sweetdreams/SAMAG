Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies in time series data while providing explainable insights. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to identify relevant sub-sequences and features, enabling the model to focus on the most informative regions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for its predictions.
