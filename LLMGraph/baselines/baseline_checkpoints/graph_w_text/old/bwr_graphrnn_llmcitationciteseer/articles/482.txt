Node classification is a fundamental problem in graph learning, where the goal is to predict the labels of nodes in a graph. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity and ignore the hierarchical structure of graphs. We propose a Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and hierarchically aggregate features from different levels of the graph. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational cost by up to 3x compared to existing methods.
