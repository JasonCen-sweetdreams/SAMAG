Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to autonomously decide which tasks to execute to achieve a common goal. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn effective task allocation strategies in a decentralized manner. We introduce a novel reward function that incorporates both local and global task information, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency. We evaluate our approach on a simulated robotic swarm scenario, showing that it can adapt to changing task requirements and agent capabilities.
