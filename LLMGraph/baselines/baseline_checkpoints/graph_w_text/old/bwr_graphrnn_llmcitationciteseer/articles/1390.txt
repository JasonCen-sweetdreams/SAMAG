Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify the challenges faced by visually impaired users in VR and developed a set of guidelines for designing accessible VR interfaces. Our approach incorporates audio-based feedback, tactile feedback, and personalized assistance to provide an immersive and inclusive experience. We evaluated our approach with a prototype VR application and demonstrated significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction.
