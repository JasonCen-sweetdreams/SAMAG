Designing efficient coordination mechanisms for multi-agent systems is a long-standing challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines reinforcement learning with graph attention to facilitate coordination among agents. Our method, called 'GraphAware', uses a graph neural network to model the agent interactions and a reinforcement learning framework to learn optimal policies. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that GraphAware outperforms existing methods in terms of coordination efficiency and adaptability to changing environments.
