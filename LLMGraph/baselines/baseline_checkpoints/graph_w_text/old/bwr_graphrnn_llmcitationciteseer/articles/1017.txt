Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large volumes of data. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query optimization, which exploits the structural properties of the query graph to reduce the search space. Our method, called GraphQO, utilizes a combination of graph decomposition and subgraph matching to identify efficient query plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that GraphQO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
