In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem, particularly when agents have different capabilities and tasks have varying priorities. This paper proposes a novel decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'DMARL-TA', which enables agents to learn optimal task allocation strategies in dynamic environments. We introduce a graph attention mechanism to model inter-agent dependencies and a hierarchical policy architecture to handle task prioritization. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that DMARL-TA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate and system efficiency.
