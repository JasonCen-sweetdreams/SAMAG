In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to coordinate task allocation among agents. We propose a decentralized, hierarchical framework that combines graph neural networks with deep Q-networks to learn effective task assignment policies. Our approach takes into account agent capabilities, task dependencies, and environmental constraints, and is shown to outperform traditional methods in simulated scenarios involving robotic search and rescue missions.
