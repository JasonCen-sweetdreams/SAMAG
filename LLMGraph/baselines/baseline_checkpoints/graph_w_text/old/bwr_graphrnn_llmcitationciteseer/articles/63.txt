Column-oriented database systems have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to efficiently store and query large datasets. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning techniques to identify the most efficient query plans. Our approach, called COLOP, uses a combination of feature extraction, clustering, and reinforcement learning to select the best query plan from a vast search space. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that COLOP outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
