Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large volumes of data. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and network topology. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach to query optimization, which leverages graph neural networks to learn the query optimization problem. Our approach, called Distributed Query Optimizer (DQO), uses a graph neural network to model the query optimization problem and learns to predict the optimal query plan. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that DQO outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
