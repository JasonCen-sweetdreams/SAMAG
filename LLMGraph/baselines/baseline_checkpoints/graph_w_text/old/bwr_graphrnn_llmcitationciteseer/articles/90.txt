Few-shot node classification on graph-structured data remains a challenging task, especially when dealing with limited labeled nodes. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel meta-learning approach that leverages hierarchical graph representations to enhance thefew-shot learning capability. HGAT employs a nested attention mechanism to adaptively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs, enabling the model to effectively generalize to unseen classes. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art few-shot node classification methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness.
