This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and limitations need to cooperate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that leverages Graph Neural Networks and Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients to learn decentralized task allocation policies. Our approach is flexible, scalable, and adaptable to changing environmental conditions and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to traditional decentralized allocation methods.
