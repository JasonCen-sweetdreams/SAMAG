Multi-agent task allocation is a fundamental problem in distributed systems, where agents with varying capabilities need to be assigned tasks to optimize overall system performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn effective task allocation strategies. Our method, called MATRL, uses a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn task allocation policies. We demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of MATRL on a variety of task allocation scenarios, outperforming traditional optimization-based approaches and showing robustness to agent failures and changes in task requirements.
