Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly prevalent in modern data-intensive applications. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query planning and the need to balance response time and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment and receiving rewards based on query performance. Our experimental results show that the RL-based query optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers in terms of query response time and resource efficiency.
