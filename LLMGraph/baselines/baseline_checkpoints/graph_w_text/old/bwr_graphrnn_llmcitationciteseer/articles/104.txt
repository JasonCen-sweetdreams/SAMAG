Few-shot image classification has seen significant progress with the advent of contrastive learning, but existing methods often rely on large batch sizes and computationally expensive similarity calculations. We propose a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, 'HiCoL', that leverages a novel clustering-based approach to reduce the computational complexity of contrastive loss calculations. Our method learns to identify hierarchical clusters of similar images, enabling efficient few-shot classification. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmarks, including mini-ImageNet and CIFAR-FS, with significant reductions in computational cost and memory requirements.
