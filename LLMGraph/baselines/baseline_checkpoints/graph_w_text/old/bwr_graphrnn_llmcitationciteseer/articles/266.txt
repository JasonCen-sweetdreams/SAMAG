Modern recommendation systems face significant scalability challenges as user-item graphs continue to grow in size and complexity. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that leverages both local and global graph structures to improve recommendation accuracy and efficiency. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical pooling mechanism, adaptive attention weights, and a novel graph-aware regularization term to learn robust user and item representations. Experimental results on several large-scale datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of precision, recall, and A/B testing metrics, while reducing computational costs by up to 30%.
