Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the daily lives of older adults with motor impairments. However, existing systems often struggle to accurately recognize gestures due to the variability in motor abilities and fatigue. This paper proposes an adaptive gesture recognition system that utilizes machine learning algorithms to learn the unique gesture patterns of individual users. Our system incorporates a user-centered design approach, involving participatory design workshops and usability testing with older adults, to develop a personalized and adaptable interface. Experimental results show that our system achieves a significant improvement in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional systems.
