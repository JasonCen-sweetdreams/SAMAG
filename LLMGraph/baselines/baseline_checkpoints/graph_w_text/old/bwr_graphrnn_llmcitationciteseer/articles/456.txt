Traffic signal control is a complex problem that requires real-time adaptation to changing traffic patterns. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for adaptive traffic signal control, where each agent learns to optimize its signal phase timing based on local traffic observations and rewards from neighboring agents. We introduce a novel attention-based communication mechanism that enables agents to share traffic information and coordinate their actions. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulator show that our approach outperforms traditional fixed-time and dynamic signal control methods, reducing congestion and travel times by up to 25%
