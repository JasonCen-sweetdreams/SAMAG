Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of graph data and the need to balance resource utilization across distributed nodes. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to select optimal query plans based on feedback from the execution environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world graph dataset, achieving significant improvements in query performance and resource efficiency compared to traditional optimization techniques.
