Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various information retrieval tasks, but they often struggle to capture nuanced query semantics. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages document embeddings to improve the retrieval performance of neural models. Our method, dubbed 'EmbedExpan', uses a graph-based algorithm to select expansion terms that are semantically closest to the original query. We evaluate EmbedExpan on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall compared to existing query expansion techniques.
