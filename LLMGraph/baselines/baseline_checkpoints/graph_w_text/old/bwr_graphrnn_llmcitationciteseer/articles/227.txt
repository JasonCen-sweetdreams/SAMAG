As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding how humans collaborate with agents in immersive environments is crucial. This study explores the impact of embodiment on human-agent collaboration in VR, focusing on the role of anthropomorphic agents. We conducted a user study with 40 participants, manipulating the level of embodiment and agent autonomy. Results show that embodied agents lead to increased trust and cooperation, but only when agent autonomy is high. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based collaborative systems and highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of human-agent interaction in immersive environments.
