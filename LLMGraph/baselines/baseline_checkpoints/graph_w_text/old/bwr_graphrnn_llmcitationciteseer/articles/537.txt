This paper presents a novel decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for autonomous traffic signal control. We model the traffic network as a graph, where each intersection is represented by an autonomous agent. The agents learn to coordinate their actions to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. We introduce a new reward function that incorporates real-time traffic data and incorporates fairness constraints to prevent biased decision-making. Experimental results on a real-world traffic dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional fixed-time signal control methods and adapts well to dynamic traffic conditions.
