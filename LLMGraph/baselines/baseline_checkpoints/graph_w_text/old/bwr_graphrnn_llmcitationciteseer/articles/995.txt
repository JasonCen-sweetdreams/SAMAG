Distributed database systems face significant performance bottlenecks due to complex query optimization. We propose a novel approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to model relationships between database entities and optimize query execution plans. Our method, called 'KGQP', learns vector representations of database schema elements and uses them to predict optimal query plans. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that KGQP outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query execution time, while reducing optimization overhead by 50%.
