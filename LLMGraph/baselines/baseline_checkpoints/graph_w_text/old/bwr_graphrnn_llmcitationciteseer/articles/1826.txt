Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing methods often rely on simplistic feature attribution techniques that fail to capture complex relationships between users and items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that integrates graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical clustering to learn interpretable representations of user-item interactions. We demonstrate the efficacy of HGAT on three real-world datasets, showcasing improved recommendation accuracy and meaningful explanations of user preferences.
