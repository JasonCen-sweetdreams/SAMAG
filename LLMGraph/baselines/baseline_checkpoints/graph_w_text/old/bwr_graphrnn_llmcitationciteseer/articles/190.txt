In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to allocate tasks to agents in a cooperative environment. We introduce a novel DCOP algorithm, 'DCAgent', which leverages local search and communication protocols to find near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark problems demonstrate that DCAgent outperforms existing centralized and decentralized methods in terms of solution quality and communication overhead.
