Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We developed a novel avatar customization framework that incorporates user preferences, behavior, and biometric data. Our user study (N=120) reveals that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, presence, and overall satisfaction in VR applications. We also identify key factors influencing avatar personalization and discuss implications for VR system design.
