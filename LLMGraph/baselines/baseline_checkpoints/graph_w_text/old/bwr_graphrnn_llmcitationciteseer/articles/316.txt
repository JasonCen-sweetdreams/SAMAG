Conversational search systems aim to provide users with more natural and engaging search experiences, but often struggle with the inherent ambiguity of natural language queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, called Embedding-Based Query Expansion (EBQE), uses a graph-based algorithm to identify relevant expansion terms and weights them based on their proximity to the original query in the embedding space. Experimental results on a large conversational search dataset demonstrate that EBQE significantly improves the retrieval performance and ranking quality compared to traditional query expansion methods.
