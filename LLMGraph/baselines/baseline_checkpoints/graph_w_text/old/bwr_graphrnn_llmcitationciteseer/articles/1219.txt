In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem due to the lack of global information and communication constraints. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to allocate tasks efficiently in such systems. We introduce a decentralized DRL framework, 'MA-TAR', that enables agents to learn optimal task allocation policies based on local observations and limited communication with neighbors. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario show that MA-TAR outperforms traditional decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
