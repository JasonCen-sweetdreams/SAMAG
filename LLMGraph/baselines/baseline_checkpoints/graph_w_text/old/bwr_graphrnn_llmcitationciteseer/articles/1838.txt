Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in recent years, but optimizing queries for these systems remains a challenging task. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on manual tuning and heuristics, which can lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed databases. Our method, 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy based on database statistics and query workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
