Query optimization is a critical component of modern database systems, but traditional approaches rely on static heuristics and fail to adapt to changing workloads. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages learned indexes and reinforcement learning to accelerate query optimization. Our approach uses a neural network to learn a compact representation of the data distribution, which is then used to guide the query optimizer. Experimental results on a large-scale benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves significant speedups over state-of-the-art query optimizers, while also improving plan quality and adaptability to changing workloads.
