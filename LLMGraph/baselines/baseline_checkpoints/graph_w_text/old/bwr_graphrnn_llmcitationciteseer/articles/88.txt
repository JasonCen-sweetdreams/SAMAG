Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepQE', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion. We formulate query expansion as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to select expansion terms that maximize the expected retrieval performance. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
