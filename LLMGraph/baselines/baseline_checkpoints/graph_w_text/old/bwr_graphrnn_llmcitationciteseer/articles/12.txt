Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to develop accessible conversational interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving cognitive walkthroughs, interviews, and usability testing with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments. Our findings highlight the importance of simplifying language, providing visual cues, and incorporating error forgiveness mechanisms. We propose a set of design guidelines and a novel interface framework, 'CogniChat', which demonstrates improved usability and user experience for this population.
