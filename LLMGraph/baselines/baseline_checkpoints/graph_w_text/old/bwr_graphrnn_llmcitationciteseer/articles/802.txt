Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by user experience issues. This paper explores the role of personalization in enhancing user experience in VR. We designed and conducted a user study to investigate how personalized VR environments, tailored to individual users' preferences and needs, affect user engagement, satisfaction, and cognitive load. Our results show that personalization significantly improves user experience, particularly for users with prior VR experience. We also identify key factors influencing personalization effectiveness and provide guidelines for VR developers to create more user-centered experiences.
