The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms has severe consequences for individuals and society. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) for multi-modal fake news detection. Our approach leverages graph attention to model complex relationships between users, articles, and their respective modalities (text, images, and videos). We introduce a hierarchical fusion mechanism to integrate modality-specific features, enabling the model to capture both local and global patterns. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting fake news, achieving an F1-score of 92.5%.
