Urban traffic management is a complex problem that requires efficient allocation of tasks to various agents, such as traffic lights and surveillance cameras. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using multi-agent reinforcement learning, where agents learn to allocate tasks autonomously based on real-time traffic conditions. We introduce a novel reward function that incorporates traffic flow metrics, and demonstrate improved performance compared to traditional centralized approaches. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network show that our approach reduces congestion and travel times, while adapting to changing traffic patterns.
