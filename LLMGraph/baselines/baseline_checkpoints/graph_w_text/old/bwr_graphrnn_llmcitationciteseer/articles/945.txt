Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence, but optimizing queries in these systems poses significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We design a DRL agent that learns to optimize queries by interacting with a simulated data warehouse environment, leveraging a combination of exploration-exploitation strategies and reward functions tailored to query performance metrics. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving up to 3x speedup in query execution times while maintaining accurate results.
