Augmented reality (AR) technology has the potential to improve the daily lives of older adults, but existing AR interfaces are often inaccessible to this demographic. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating accessible AR interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and identified key design principles for accessible AR interaction, including simplicity, consistency, and multimodal feedback. We implemented these principles in a prototype AR system and evaluated its usability with 20 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction.
