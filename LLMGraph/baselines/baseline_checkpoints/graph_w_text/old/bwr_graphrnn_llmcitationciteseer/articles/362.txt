Query optimization is crucial for efficient data retrieval in distributed database systems. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph-based models to optimize query execution plans. We introduce a graph neural network (GNN) that learns to represent query plans as graphs, enabling the identification of optimal execution paths. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, reducing query latency by up to 30%. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the optimality of our approach.
