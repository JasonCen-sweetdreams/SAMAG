We address the problem of distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents have limited capabilities and tasks have varying priorities. We propose a novel auction-based mechanism, called 'TaskAssign', which leverages the concept of virtual currency to facilitate efficient task allocation. TaskAssign enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences, while ensuring that high-priority tasks are allocated to the most suitable agents. We evaluate TaskAssign through extensive simulations, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing distributed task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion rate, latency, and system efficiency.
