Hybrid search engines, which combine keyword-based and semantic search, have gained popularity. However, they often rely on brute-force query reformulation, leading to high computational costs. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach, 'DeepRef', to efficiently reformulate user queries. Our model leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify relevant query aspects and generates optimized reformulations. We evaluate DeepRef on a large-scale dataset, demonstrating a 30% reduction in query processing time while maintaining retrieval effectiveness. Furthermore, we show that DeepRef can be seamlessly integrated into existing hybrid search engines, enhancing their overall performance.
