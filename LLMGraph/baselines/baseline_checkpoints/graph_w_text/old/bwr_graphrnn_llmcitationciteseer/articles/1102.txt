Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, but their lack of uncertainty awareness hinders their applicability in high-stakes domains. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) offer a promising solution, but their computational overhead and difficulty in scaling to deep models limit their adoption. This paper proposes a novel framework, Bayesian Neural Symbolic Learning (BNSL), which leverages symbolic reasoning to efficiently estimate uncertainty in DNNs. By exploiting the structural properties of neural networks, BNSL reduces the computational cost of uncertainty estimation while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BNSL on various image classification tasks, showing significant improvements over existing methods.
