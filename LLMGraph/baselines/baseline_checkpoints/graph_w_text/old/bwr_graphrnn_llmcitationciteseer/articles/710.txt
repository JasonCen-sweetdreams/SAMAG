Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but optimizing complex queries across multiple nodes remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to learn efficient query plans. Our RL agent, 'DQOpt', uses a graph neural network to represent the query graph and a policy network to generate optimal join orders. We evaluate DQOpt on a real-world distributed database benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
