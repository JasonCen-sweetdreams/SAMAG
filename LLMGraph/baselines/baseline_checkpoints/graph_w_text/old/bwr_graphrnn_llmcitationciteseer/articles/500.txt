Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their accessibility for older adults remains a significant concern. This study investigates the design factors that affect the usability of voice assistants for older adults, with a focus on speech recognition, feedback, and dialogue management. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, and our findings highlight the importance of adapting speech recognition models to accommodate age-related changes in speech patterns, providing multimodal feedback, and designing more conversational dialogue flows. Our results inform the development of more inclusive voice assistants that can better support the needs of older adults.
