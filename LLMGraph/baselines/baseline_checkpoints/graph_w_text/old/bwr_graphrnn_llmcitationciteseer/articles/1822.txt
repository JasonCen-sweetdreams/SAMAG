In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive strategies to optimize system performance. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to allocate tasks in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We introduce a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages the strengths of individual agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization methods in various scenarios, including warehouse automation and search-and-rescue operations.
