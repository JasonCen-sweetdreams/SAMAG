Conversational search systems aim to provide more natural and interactive search experiences. However, they often struggle with query understanding and reformulation. This paper presents a novel approach, 'ConverseEmb', which leverages context-aware embeddings to better capture user intent and reformulate queries. Our method jointly learns query and context embeddings using a multi-task objective, incorporating both semantic and syntactic features. Experiments on a large conversational search dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query reformulation quality and search result relevance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
