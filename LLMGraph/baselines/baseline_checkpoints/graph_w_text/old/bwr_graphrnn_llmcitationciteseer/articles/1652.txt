Zero-shot image classification has gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods often require large amounts of labeled data and computational resources. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical contrastive learning approach, 'HiCo', which leverages the intrinsic structure of the output space to learn informative representations. By optimizing a hierarchical contrastive loss, HiCo effectively captures semantic relationships between classes and enables efficient zero-shot classification. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiCo outperforms state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational costs by up to 50%
