In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and optimize task assignments. Our approach, called GNN-TA, uses a distributed optimization algorithm to learn a neural network that predicts task allocations based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication graph structures. Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms traditional centralized and distributed allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to changing system dynamics.
