This paper presents a novel multi-agent system for real-time traffic management in smart cities. We propose a distributed constraint optimization framework that enables autonomous agents to coordinate and make decisions in a decentralized manner. Our approach leverages graph-based models to represent traffic networks and constraint satisfaction problems to optimize traffic flow. Experimental results using a simulated urban traffic scenario demonstrate improved traffic efficiency and reduced congestion compared to traditional centralized approaches. We also evaluate the scalability and robustness of our system in the presence of agent failures and communication delays.
