Multi-tenant database systems pose significant query optimization challenges due to varying workload patterns and resource constraints. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to query optimization, proposing a novel framework, 'RL-Optimizer', that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database system. We design a reward function that balances query latency and system resources, and demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-Optimizer in a simulated multi-tenant environment, achieving up to 30% improvement in query performance compared to traditional optimization techniques.
