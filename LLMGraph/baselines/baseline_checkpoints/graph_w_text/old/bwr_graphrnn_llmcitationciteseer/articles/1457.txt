In modern manufacturing systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for productivity and resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARLA', for dynamic task allocation in manufacturing systems. MARLA leverages a decentralized, asynchronous learning approach, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on local observations and communicates with neighboring agents to optimize system-wide performance. We demonstrate MARLA's scalability and effectiveness in a simulation environment, showing significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization compared to traditional, centralized approaches.
