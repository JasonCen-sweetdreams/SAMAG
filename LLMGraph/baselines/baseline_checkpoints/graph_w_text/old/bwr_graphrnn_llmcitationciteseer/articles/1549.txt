Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it aims to capture the underlying intent behind a user's query. Traditional methods rely on manually crafted rules or statistical models, which can be limited in their ability to capture nuanced relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel approach, HierNE, which leverages hierarchical neural embeddings to model the semantic relationships between queries and documents. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierNE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while also providing interpretable results.
