Autonomous vehicles require efficient and reliable control systems to navigate complex environments. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'AutoPilot', which integrates advanced computer vision and sensor fusion techniques to enable real-time autonomous vehicle control. We develop a hierarchical policy architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to focus on critical driving scenarios, improving overall driving performance and safety. Experimental results on a realistic simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoPilot in various traffic scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of speed, safety, and fuel efficiency.
