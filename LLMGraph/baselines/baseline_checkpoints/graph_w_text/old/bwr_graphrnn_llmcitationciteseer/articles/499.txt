Few-shot visual classification has seen significant progress with the advent of meta-learning techniques. However, existing methods often suffer from limited scalability and poor generalization to novel classes. This paper introduces Hierarchical Prototypical Networks (HPN), a novel meta-learning framework that leverages hierarchical clustering to learn robust and transferable prototypes. Our approach enables few-shot classification by learning a hierarchical representation of the input space, which is shown to improve performance on benchmark datasets such as mini-ImageNet and CIFAR-FS. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of HPN in adapting to new classes with limited labeled data, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.
