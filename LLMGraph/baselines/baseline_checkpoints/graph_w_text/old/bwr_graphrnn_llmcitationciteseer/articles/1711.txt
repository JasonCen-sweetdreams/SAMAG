Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a popular technique to improve retrieval performance, but it often relies on manual feature engineering and exhaustive parameter tuning. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, which learns to generate context-aware query representations that capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Experimental results on standard TREC datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
