Cloud-based data warehouses have become increasingly popular for storing and processing large datasets. However, distributed query optimization remains a significant challenge due to data partitioning and allocation. This paper proposes a novel data partitioning strategy, 'DynPart', which leverages query workload patterns and data characteristics to optimize partitioning and reduce query latency. We demonstrate that DynPart outperforms existing partitioning strategies in terms of query performance and resource utilization, achieving an average query speedup of 2.5x on a real-world cloud-based data warehouse.
