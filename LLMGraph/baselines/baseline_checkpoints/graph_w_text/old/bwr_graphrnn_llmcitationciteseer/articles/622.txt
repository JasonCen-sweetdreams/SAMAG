As augmented reality (AR) environments become increasingly prevalent, traditional authentication methods are no longer sufficient. This paper proposes a novel gaze-based authentication approach, leveraging the unique characteristics of AR head-mounted displays. Our system, 'GazeAuth', utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze users' gaze patterns and verify their identities. We conducted a user study with 50 participants, demonstrating a false acceptance rate of 2.5% and a false rejection rate of 5.2%, outperforming existing authentication methods in AR settings.
