Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data centers, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and design a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the optimal query execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average query latency reduction of 30% and a 25% improvement in system throughput.
