In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient coalition formation among autonomous agents. This paper proposes a distributed algorithm, 'DCFA', which enables agents to form coalitions based on their capabilities and task requirements. DCFA utilizes a novel combination of graph theory and auction-based mechanisms to optimize coalition formation, ensuring efficient task allocation and minimizing communication overhead. We evaluate DCFA through extensive simulations, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication costs compared to existing approaches.
