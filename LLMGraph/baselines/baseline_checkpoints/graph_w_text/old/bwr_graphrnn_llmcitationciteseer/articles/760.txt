This paper presents a novel approach to designing adaptive gesture recognition systems for users with motor impairments. We propose a machine learning-based framework that leverages a combination of computer vision and sensor data to recognize gestures. Our system adaptively adjusts its recognition threshold based on the user's performance over time, allowing for more accurate and personalized gesture recognition. We evaluate our approach through a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
