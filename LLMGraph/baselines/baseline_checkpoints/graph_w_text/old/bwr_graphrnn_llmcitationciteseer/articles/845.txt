Microblog retrieval systems strive to retrieve relevant tweets for user queries. However, the short length and informal nature of tweets make it challenging to capture their semantic meaning. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages context-aware embeddings to enrich the query representation. By incorporating user-profile and tweet-content information, CAQE generates more effective expansion terms that better capture the query intent. Our experiments on a large-scale Twitter dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and MAP.
