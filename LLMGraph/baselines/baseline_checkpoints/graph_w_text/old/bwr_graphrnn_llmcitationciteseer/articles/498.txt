Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various applications, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering-based approach using variational autoencoders (VAEs) for identifying anomalies in multivariate time-series data. Our method, called 'HC-VAE', leverages the hierarchical structure of the data to learn robust representations and detect anomalies at multiple scales. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HC-VAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and F1-score, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.
