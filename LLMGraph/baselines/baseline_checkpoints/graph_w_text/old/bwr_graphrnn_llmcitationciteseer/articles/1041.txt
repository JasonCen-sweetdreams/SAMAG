Autonomous vehicles require real-time decision-making to ensure safety and efficiency. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'RT-Drive', which leverages a hybrid architecture combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn optimal driving policies. We introduce a multi-objective reward function that balances safety, efficiency, and comfort, and propose a novel exploration strategy that adaptively adjusts the exploration rate based on the vehicle's velocity and surroundings. Experiments on a large-scale autonomous driving simulator demonstrate that RT-Drive outperforms existing methods in terms of response time, fuel efficiency, and collision avoidance.
