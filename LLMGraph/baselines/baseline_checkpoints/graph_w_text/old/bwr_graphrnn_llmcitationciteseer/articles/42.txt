Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face the challenge of efficiently processing complex queries across multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to improve query efficiency in DIR systems. We introduce a graph neural network-based model that learns to represent queries and documents as dense vectors, enabling fast and accurate similarity calculations. Experimental results on a large-scale DIR dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces query latency by up to 40% compared to traditional term-based indexing methods, while maintaining retrieval effectiveness.
