The proliferation of fake news and rumors on social media has severe consequences for individuals and society. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in rumor detection, but their lack of interpretability hinders trust and understanding. This paper proposes an explainable GNN framework, 'RumorLens', which incorporates attention-based feature importance and graph-based visualizations. We evaluate RumorLens on a large-scale Twitter dataset, demonstrating improved detection performance and providing insights into the key factors contributing to rumor dissemination.
