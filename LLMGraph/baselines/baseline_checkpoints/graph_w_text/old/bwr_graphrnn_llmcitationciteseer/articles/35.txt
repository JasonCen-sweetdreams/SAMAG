Node classification is a fundamental problem in graph-structured data, where the goal is to predict the labels of nodes based on their attributes and relationships. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results, but they often struggle with complex graphs that exhibit hierarchical structures. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN (HAGNN) model, which explicitly captures hierarchical relationships between nodes by incorporating attention mechanisms at multiple scales. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models, achieving significant improvements in node classification accuracy.
