As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding how to design effective and engaging interfaces is crucial. This study investigates the impact of personalization on user engagement in VR environments. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, exposing them to both personalized and non-personalized VR interfaces. Our results show that personalized interfaces lead to significant increases in user engagement, measured through dwell time, interaction frequency, and self-reported satisfaction. We also identify key factors influencing personalization effectiveness, including user familiarity and content relevance. Our findings have implications for the design of future VR systems, highlighting the importance of incorporating user-centric approaches to enhance overall user experience.
