Individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder affecting articulation and intelligibility, face significant challenges when interacting with voice-driven interfaces. This paper presents a co-design approach, involving people with dysarthria as equal partners, to create more accessible and usable voice interfaces. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops, resulting in the development of novel interface features, such as personalized voice profiles and adaptive error correction. Our usability evaluation with 15 participants with dysarthria demonstrates significant improvements in interaction success rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
