In autonomous multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism for task allocation, which leverages the concept of combinatorial auctions to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities and preferences. We introduce a novel bidding strategy that incorporates uncertainty and risk aversion, enabling agents to adapt to dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms centralized optimization methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
