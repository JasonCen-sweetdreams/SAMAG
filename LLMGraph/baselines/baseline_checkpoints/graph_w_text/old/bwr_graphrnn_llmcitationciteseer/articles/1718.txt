In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. This paper introduces HAN-MAD, a novel hierarchical attention network that enables explainable decision-making in such systems. HAN-MAD leverages attention mechanisms to model agent relationships and intentions, while also providing interpretable insights into the decision-making process. We evaluate HAN-MAD on a real-world autonomous vehicle scenario, demonstrating improved decision-making accuracy and interpretability compared to prior approaches.
