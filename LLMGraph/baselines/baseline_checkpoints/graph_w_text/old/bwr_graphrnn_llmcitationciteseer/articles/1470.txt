Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges when interacting with gestural interfaces. This paper presents 'AdaptiGesture', a novel framework for designing adaptive gestural interfaces that accommodate users' unique motor abilities. Our approach leverages machine learning to analyze users' motor patterns and adapt the interface's sensitivity, speed, and gesture recognition thresholds in real-time. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments, demonstrating that AdaptiGesture significantly improves interaction accuracy and reduces fatigue compared to traditional gestural interfaces.
