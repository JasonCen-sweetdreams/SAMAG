The increasing adoption of graph databases in various applications has led to a growing need for efficient query optimization techniques. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', designed specifically for distributed graph databases. GraphOpt leverages a combination of graph partitioning, query rewriting, and adaptive join ordering to minimize query execution time. We also introduce a cost model that accurately estimates query execution costs, enabling more effective optimization decisions. Experiments on a large-scale graph dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
