Multi-tenancy in cloud-based database systems has led to a significant increase in query optimization complexity. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'TenantAware', which leverages statistical modeling and reinforcement learning to minimize query execution times. TenantAware adaptively adjusts query plans based on real-time workload analysis, taking into account tenant-specific resource constraints and data access patterns. Our experimental evaluation on a commercial database system demonstrates that TenantAware reduces average query latency by up to 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques, while maintaining fairness and resource efficiency across tenants.
