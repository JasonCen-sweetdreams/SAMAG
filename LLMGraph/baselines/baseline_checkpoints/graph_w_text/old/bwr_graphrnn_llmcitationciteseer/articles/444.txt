Traditional information retrieval systems rely on keyword-based matching, which often fails to capture the nuanced semantics of natural language queries. This paper presents a novel approach to document retrieval using hierarchical semantic embeddings (HSE). HSE represents documents and queries as dense vectors in a hierarchical semantic space, enabling more accurate matching at multiple levels of abstraction. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art keyword-based and neural retrieval models.
