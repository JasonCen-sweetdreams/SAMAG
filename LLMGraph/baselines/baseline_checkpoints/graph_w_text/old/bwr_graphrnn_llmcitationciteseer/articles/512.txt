Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on effective query formulation to retrieve relevant documents. We propose a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to learn dense query embeddings. NQE jointly optimizes query representation, expansion, and ranking, outperforming traditional keyword-based expansion methods. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval recall and end-to-end question answering accuracy, showcasing the potential of NQE in real-world ODQA applications.
