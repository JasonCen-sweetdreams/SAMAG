Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and node heterogeneity. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL), which learns to select the optimal execution plan for a given query based on the system's current state. Our proposed framework, 'RL-Optimizer', utilizes a deep Q-network to predict the execution time of different query plans and adapt to changing system conditions. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time.
