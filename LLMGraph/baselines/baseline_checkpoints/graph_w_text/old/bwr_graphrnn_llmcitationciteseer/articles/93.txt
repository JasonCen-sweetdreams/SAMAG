Real-time object detection in video streams is a critical task in various applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel attention-based transformer architecture, 'VIDETR', which achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time object detection. VIDETR employs a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant regions of the input video frame, thereby improving detection accuracy and reducing computational overhead. We evaluate VIDETR on various benchmark datasets, including Cityscapes, KITTI, and MOT, and demonstrate its superiority over existing real-time object detection methods.
