Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle with query ambiguity, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel neural re-ranking approach, 'NeuroXPand', which leverages query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. Our method uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify relevant terms and phrases in the query and top-retrieved documents, and then re-ranks the documents based on their semantic similarity to the expanded query. Experiments on the TREC Ad-hoc benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
