Main-memory column-store databases have emerged as a promising solution for real-time analytics. However, optimizing query processing in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'Raptor', which leverages machine learning models to predict query patterns and optimize data storage layouts. Raptor integrates a cost-based optimizer with a reinforcement learning agent that learns to adapt to changing workload patterns. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Raptor achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance and 2x reduction in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
