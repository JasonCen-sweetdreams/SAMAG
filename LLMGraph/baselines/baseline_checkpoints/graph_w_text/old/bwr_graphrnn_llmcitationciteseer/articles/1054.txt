Task allocation is a critical problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to coordinate to achieve common goals. This paper presents a novel approach to real-time task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'MARIO', which enables agents to learn coordination strategies through self-play. MARIO employs a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn task allocation policies. We evaluate MARIO on a variety of task allocation scenarios and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and coordination efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
