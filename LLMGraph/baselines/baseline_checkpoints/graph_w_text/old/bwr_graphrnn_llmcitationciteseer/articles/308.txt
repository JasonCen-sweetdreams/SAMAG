Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and healthcare professionals to identify key design requirements. Our proposed system, 'ElderVoice', incorporates features such as speech adaptation, personalized feedback, and intuitive error handling. We evaluated ElderVoice with 20 older adults and found significant improvements in usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants. Our study highlights the importance of involving older adults in the design process to create more inclusive and supportive technologies.
