Traditional information retrieval (IR) approaches rely on manual query construction, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. This paper presents a novel neural query graph generation framework, 'NQGG', which learns to automatically construct query graphs from natural language queries. Our approach leverages a graph neural network to model query-document interactions and generates a compact query graph that captures the semantic relationships between query terms. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset show that NQGG achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art IR baselines.
