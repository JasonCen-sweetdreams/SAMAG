This study explores the relationship between embodied cognition and gesture-based interaction in virtual reality (VR). We designed an experiment where participants performed a series of tasks in a VR environment using either a gesture-based or a controller-based interface. Our results show that participants who used the gesture-based interface exhibited improved cognitive performance and reported higher levels of presence and immersion. We also found that individual differences in embodied cognition, as measured by a standardized questionnaire, significantly predicted the effectiveness of the gesture-based interface. Our findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and engaging VR experiences.
