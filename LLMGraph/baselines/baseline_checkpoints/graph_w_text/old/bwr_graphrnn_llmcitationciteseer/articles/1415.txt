Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities and resources must cooperate to achieve a common goal. This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized algorithm, 'MADRL-TA', which enables agents to learn optimal task allocation strategies through self-play and communication. Our experimental results show that MADRL-TA outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization, especially in scenarios with dynamic agent availability and task uncertainty.
