This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for efficient task allocation in distributed manufacturing systems. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and propose a scalable algorithm that integrates deep reinforcement learning with communication protocols to enable effective collaboration among agents. Experimental results on a simulated manufacturing system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization. We also provide insights into the impact of agent communication and coordination on system performance.
