Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved remarkable success in various domains, but the lack of interpretability hinders its widespread adoption. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that enables explainable MARL. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex interactions between agents and incorporates a hierarchical structure to capture both local and global dependencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in various MARL benchmarks, showcasing improved performance and providing insights into the decision-making process of agents through visualized attention weights.
