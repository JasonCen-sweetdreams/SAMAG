Individuals with speech disabilities often face significant barriers when interacting with conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive conversational interfaces that accommodate various speech disabilities. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with individuals with speech disabilities to identify key design requirements. Our framework incorporates multimodal input methods, adaptive language processing, and personalized feedback mechanisms. We evaluated our approach through a usability study, demonstrating improved interaction outcomes and user satisfaction for participants with speech disabilities.
