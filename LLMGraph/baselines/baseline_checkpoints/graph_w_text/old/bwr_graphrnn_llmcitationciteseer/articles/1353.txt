Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While recent deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for explainable time series anomaly detection. Our model incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple scales to capture complex patterns and relationships in time series data. We also introduce a novel feature attribution technique to quantify the contribution of each input feature to the anomaly score. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies and providing interpretable explanations.
