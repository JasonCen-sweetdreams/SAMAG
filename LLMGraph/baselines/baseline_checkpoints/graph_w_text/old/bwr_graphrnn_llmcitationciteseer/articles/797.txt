In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to agents in a distributed manner. Our proposed algorithm, 'GraphTask', represents the agent network as a graph and uses GNNs to learn a task allocation policy that minimizes communication overhead and maximizes global reward. We evaluate GraphTask in a simulated environment and demonstrate its scalability and adaptability in dynamic scenarios, outperforming traditional centralized approaches.
