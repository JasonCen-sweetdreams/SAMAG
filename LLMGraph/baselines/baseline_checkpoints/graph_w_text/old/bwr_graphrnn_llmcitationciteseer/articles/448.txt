Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop a conversational system that accommodates the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our proposed system, 'EasyChat', incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified language processing, visual cues, and error tolerance. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
