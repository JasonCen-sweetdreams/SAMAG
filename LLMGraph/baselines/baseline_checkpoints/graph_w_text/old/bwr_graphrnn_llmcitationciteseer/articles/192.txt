Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by limitations in traditional speech-based interactions. This paper presents a multimodal approach to designing inclusive voice assistants, incorporating gesture recognition, visual feedback, and tactile output to enhance accessibility for older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction when using our proposed system. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and accessible voice assistants that cater to the diverse needs of older adults.
