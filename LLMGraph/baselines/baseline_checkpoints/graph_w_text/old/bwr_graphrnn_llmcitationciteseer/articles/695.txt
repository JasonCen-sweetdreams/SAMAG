Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability for older adults remains a concern. This study investigates the design of inclusive voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults. We conducted a multimodal interaction study with 30 participants aged 65+, examining the effects of speech rate, tone, and visual feedback on user experience. Our results show that older adults prefer slower speech rates and more polite tone, while visual feedback improves their understanding of system responses. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating more accessible voice assistants and discuss implications for future research.
