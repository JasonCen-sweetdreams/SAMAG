We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for real-time traffic optimization in complex urban networks. Our approach, dubbed 'MA-RTOP', leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and learn decentralized policies that adapt to dynamic traffic conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MA-RTOP in reducing travel times and increasing network throughput through extensive simulations on real-world traffic datasets. The proposed framework is scalable, flexible, and can be easily integrated with existing intelligent transportation systems.
