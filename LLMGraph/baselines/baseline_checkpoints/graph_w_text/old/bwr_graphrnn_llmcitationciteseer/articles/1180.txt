In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'Agents-DCOP', which leverages distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to allocate tasks to autonomous agents. Agents-DCOP uses a novel communication protocol to exchange constraint information and iteratively refine task assignments. We evaluate Agents-DCOP on a range of scenarios, including disaster response and smart city applications, and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization compared to centralized approaches.
