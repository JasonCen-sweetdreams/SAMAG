Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly popular in modern computing systems. However, users with motor impairments, such as those experienced by the elderly, often struggle to interact with these systems accurately. This paper presents an empirical study on designing accessible gesture-based interfaces tailored to the needs of elderly users with motor impairments. We conducted user studies to identify common gesture patterns and developed a set of guidelines for designing accessible gestures. We then implemented a prototype system incorporating these guidelines and evaluated its performance with a group of elderly users. Our results show significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction.
