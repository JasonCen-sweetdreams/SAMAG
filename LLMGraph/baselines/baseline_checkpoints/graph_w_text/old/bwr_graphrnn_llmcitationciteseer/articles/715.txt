Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper presents a novel hierarchical document representation (HDR) framework that leverages both local and global context to improve passage retrieval accuracy. Our approach represents documents as a hierarchical structure of sentences and paragraphs, enabling the capture of nuanced relationships between entities and concepts. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR outperforms state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods, achieving a 12% increase in top-1 passage retrieval accuracy while reducing computational overhead by 30%.
