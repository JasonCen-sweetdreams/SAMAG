Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with digital information, but current VR systems often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel approach to designing inclusive VR experiences for visually impaired users. We propose a multimodal interaction framework that leverages audio and haptic feedback to enable users to navigate and interact with virtual environments. Our approach is grounded in a user-centered design methodology, involving co-design sessions with visually impaired participants. We evaluate our system through a series of user studies, demonstrating significant improvements in usability and accessibility for visually impaired users.
