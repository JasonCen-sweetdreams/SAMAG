Distributed relational databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data centers, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to select optimal join orders and index configurations based on the database's performance metrics. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that our approach achieves up to 3x speedup compared to traditional query optimization techniques, while adapting to changing workload patterns.
