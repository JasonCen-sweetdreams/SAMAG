Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with motor impairments. However, existing systems are often designed with able-bodied individuals in mind, neglecting the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a participatory design approach to developing an inclusive gesture recognition system, tailored to the capabilities and preferences of older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies, yielding insights into the importance of adaptability, feedback, and error tolerance in gesture recognition systems. Our system, 'EasyGest', incorporates these findings and achieves an average recognition accuracy of 92.5% across a range of motor impairment levels.
