This paper explores the application of deep reinforcement learning to coordinate multi-agent systems in real-time traffic management. We propose a novel framework, 'TrafficMA', which utilizes a decentralized, actor-critic architecture to optimize traffic signal control policies in complex, dynamic environments. Our approach incorporates graph neural networks to model traffic flow and queuing dynamics, enabling agents to adapt to changing traffic conditions and minimize congestion. Experimental results using real-world traffic data demonstrate that TrafficMA outperforms traditional, rule-based traffic management systems in reducing travel times and improving network throughput.
