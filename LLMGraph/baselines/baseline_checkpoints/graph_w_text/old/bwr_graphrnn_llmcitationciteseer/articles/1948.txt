Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effectiveness of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience and engagement in VR environments. We designed an experiment with 100 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, self-presence, and enjoyment, compared to those with generic avatars. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems and the potential applications in fields such as education, healthcare, and entertainment.
