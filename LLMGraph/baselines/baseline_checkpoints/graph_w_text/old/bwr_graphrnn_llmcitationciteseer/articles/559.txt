Explainability is crucial in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for decision-making transparency and trustworthiness. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that integrates attention mechanisms at both agent and team levels. The agent-level attention enables personalized feature extraction, while the team-level attention facilitates information sharing and coordination among agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in various MARL scenarios, including predator-prey and traffic control, and show that it outperforms existing MARL methods in terms of both performance and explainability.
