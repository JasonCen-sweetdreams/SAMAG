Schema evolution is an essential aspect of modern distributed databases, where frequent changes to the schema can significantly impact query performance. This paper presents a novel query processing framework, 'EvoQP', that addresses the challenges of complex schema evolution in distributed databases. We introduce a metadata management system that tracks schema changes and maintains a versioned history of the database schema. Our framework utilizes this metadata to rewrite queries dynamically, ensuring efficient execution and minimizing the impact of schema evolution on query performance. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of EvoQP in reducing query latency and improving overall system throughput.
