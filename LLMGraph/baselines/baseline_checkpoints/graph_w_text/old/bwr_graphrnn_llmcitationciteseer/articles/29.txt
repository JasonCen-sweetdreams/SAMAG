The increasing scale and complexity of Internet of Things (IoT) networks necessitate efficient task allocation strategies. This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARLIoT', which enables autonomous task allocation among IoT devices. MARLIoT leverages a novel, graph-based state representation and a distributed Q-learning algorithm to optimize task assignments in real-time. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and energy efficiency compared to traditional, centralized approaches.
