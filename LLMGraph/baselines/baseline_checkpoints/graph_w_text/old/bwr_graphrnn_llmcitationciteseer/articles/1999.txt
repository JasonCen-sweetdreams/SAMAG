Distributed column-stores have become increasingly popular for big data analytics, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraphIx', which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to optimize join orders and reduce data transfer. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that integrates GraphIx with existing query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 3.2x over state-of-the-art query optimizers on a suite of TPC-DS benchmarks. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphIx in improving query performance and scalability for distributed column-stores.
