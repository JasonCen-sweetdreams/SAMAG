In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient assignment of tasks to agents with varying capabilities. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Our approach uses a decentralized, actor-critic architecture that enables agents to learn from their experiences and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional, heuristic-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
