As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible and inclusive technologies that support older adults with dementia. This paper presents a novel gestural interface framework, 'Ease Gestures', designed to accommodate the cognitive and motor abilities of this population. We employ a user-centered design approach, incorporating insights from caregivers, healthcare professionals, and individuals with dementia. Our evaluation results show that Ease Gestures significantly reduces errors and improves task completion time compared to traditional touchscreen interfaces, demonstrating its potential to enhance the digital lives of older adults with dementia.
