Human-robot collaboration (HRC) systems rely on accurate intention recognition to ensure efficient and safe interaction. We present a novel gaze-based approach that leverages eye-tracking data to infer human intentions in real-time. Our proposed framework, 'GazeInt', incorporates a multimodal fusion of gaze, gesture, and speech cues to recognize intentions with high accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that GazeInt outperforms existing intention recognition methods in HRC scenarios, achieving a recognition rate of 92.5% in a simulated assembly task.
