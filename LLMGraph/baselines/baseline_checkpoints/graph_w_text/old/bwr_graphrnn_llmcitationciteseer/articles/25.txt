Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data centers, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train an agent to learn an optimal policy for query planning. Experimental results on a real-world workload show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers, reducing query execution times by up to 30%. We also demonstrate the adaptability of our approach to changing workloads and system configurations.
