This paper presents a novel decentralized coordination framework for multi-agent systems in autonomous warehouse management. We propose a hybrid approach combining model-free reinforcement learning with graph-based optimization to efficiently allocate tasks and resources among agents. Our framework, 'AWESOME', integrates real-time sensory data and incorporates safety constraints to minimize collisions and optimize storage capacity. Experimental results using a realistic warehouse simulator demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced latency compared to state-of-the-art decentralized approaches.
