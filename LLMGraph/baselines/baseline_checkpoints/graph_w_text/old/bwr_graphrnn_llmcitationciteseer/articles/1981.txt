This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Neural Ranking Model (HNRM) for efficient document retrieval in information retrieval systems. HNRM leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global semantic relationships between queries and documents. Our model consists of a query encoder, a document encoder, and a ranking module, which are jointly trained using a pairwise ranking loss function. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNRM outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency.
