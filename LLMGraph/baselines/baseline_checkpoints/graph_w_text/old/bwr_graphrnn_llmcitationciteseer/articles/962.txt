In modern information retrieval systems, efficient query processing is crucial for providing timely responses to users. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based retrieval framework, 'DeepRank', which leverages scalable neural ranking models to expedite query processing in large-scale document collections. By incorporating a hierarchical attention mechanism and a query-aware document encoding scheme, DeepRank achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional keyword-based retrieval methods. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of our approach.
