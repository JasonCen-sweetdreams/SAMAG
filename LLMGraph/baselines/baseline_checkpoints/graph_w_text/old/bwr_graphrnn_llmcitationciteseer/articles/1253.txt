Voice assistants have become an integral part of daily life, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the design of accessible voice assistants tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing with 30 older adults with cognitive impairments. Our findings highlight the importance of simplifying voice command syntax, providing multimodal feedback, and incorporating caregiver support. We propose a set of design guidelines and a prototype system, 'ElderVoice', which demonstrates improved user engagement and task completion rates compared to commercial voice assistants.
