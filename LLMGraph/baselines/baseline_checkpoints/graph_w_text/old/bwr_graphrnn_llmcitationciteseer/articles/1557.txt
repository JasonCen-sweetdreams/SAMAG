Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the heterogeneity of input modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that selectively focuses on relevant modalities and contextual information to improve emotion recognition accuracy. Our HAN model consists of a modality-level attention module that adaptively weights the inputs from each modality and a context-level attention module that captures long-range dependencies in the input sequences. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.
