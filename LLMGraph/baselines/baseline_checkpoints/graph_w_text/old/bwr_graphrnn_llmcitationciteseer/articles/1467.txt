Many gesture recognition systems are designed for able-bodied users, neglecting the needs of older adults with motor impairments. This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive gesture recognition, using machine learning and computer vision techniques to accommodate varying levels of motor ability. Our system, 'GestAid', incorporates user profiling, gesture segmentation, and personalized recognition models to improve recognition accuracy and user experience. We evaluate GestAid with a cohort of older adults with Parkinson's disease, demonstrating significant improvements in recognition performance and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
