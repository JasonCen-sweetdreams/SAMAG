Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in various applications, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a significant concern. This paper investigates the structural properties of GNNs that make them susceptible to attacks. We propose a novel attack method, 'GraphSpear', which manipulates the graph structure by inserting or deleting edges to mislead the GNN. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphSpear outperforms existing attacks in terms of attack success rate and transferability. We further analyze the robustness of various GNN architectures and provide insights into the design of more resilient models.
