Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, remains a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotional expressions. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that captures both local and global dependencies across modalities. Our HAN model employs a stacked attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant features from each modality, and incorporates a sentiment-aware gating function to adaptively combine modalities. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal inputs.
