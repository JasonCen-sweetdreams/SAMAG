Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for businesses to make timely decisions. However, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck due to the sheer volume and velocity of data. This paper presents a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the benefits of column-store and row-store indexing to accelerate query processing. Our approach, called 'HybridIX', leverages a cost-based optimizer to dynamically select the optimal indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HybridIX achieves an average query performance improvement of 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods.
