In multi-agent systems, coordinating agents to achieve a common goal often involves solving complex constraint optimization problems. This paper proposes a novel distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) algorithm, called MA-DCOP, which leverages both temporal and spatial constraints to improve solution quality. MA-DCOP utilizes a hybrid approach, combining centralized and decentralized optimization techniques, to reduce communication overhead and enhance scalability. Experimental results on a real-world logistics scenario demonstrate that MA-DCOP outperforms existing DCOP algorithms in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
