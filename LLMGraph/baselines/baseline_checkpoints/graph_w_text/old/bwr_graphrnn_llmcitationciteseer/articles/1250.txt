This paper presents a novel decentralized coordination framework for autonomous agents in complex, dynamic environments. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach, where agents learn to coordinate with each other at both local and global levels. The local level focuses on task-oriented actions, while the global level optimizes team-wide objectives. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, showcasing improved team performance and adaptability compared to traditional, centralized methods.
