Coordinating multiple agents to achieve complex tasks is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel framework for multi-agent coordination based on Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs). Our approach represents tasks as a hierarchical decomposition of sub-tasks and sub-plans, allowing agents to reason about and execute tasks at multiple levels of abstraction. We propose a distributed planning algorithm that enables agents to collaborate and allocate tasks efficiently, while minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results on a logistics domain demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
