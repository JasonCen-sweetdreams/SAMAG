This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation approach for multi-agent systems using hierarchical reinforcement learning. We propose a two-level architecture, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on its local observations and communicates with neighboring agents to refine its decisions. The upper level uses a graph neural network to aggregate information from neighboring agents, while the lower level employs a deep Q-network to select tasks. Experimental results on a simulated urban search and rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized methods in terms of task completion rate and communication efficiency.
