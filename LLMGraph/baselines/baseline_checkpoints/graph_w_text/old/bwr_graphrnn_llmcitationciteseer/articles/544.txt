Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train an agent to learn an optimal query plan policy. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, resulting in improved query performance and reduced latency.
