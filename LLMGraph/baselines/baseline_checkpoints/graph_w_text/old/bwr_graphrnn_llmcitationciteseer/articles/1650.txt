Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but manually crafting effective expansion strategies can be time-consuming and domain-dependent. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework, 'QLearn', that learns to select optimal expansion terms for a given query. QLearn uses a novel reward function that balances precision and recall, and incorporates a hierarchical policy to adapt to diverse query types. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and TREC-2004 datasets demonstrate that QLearn outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
