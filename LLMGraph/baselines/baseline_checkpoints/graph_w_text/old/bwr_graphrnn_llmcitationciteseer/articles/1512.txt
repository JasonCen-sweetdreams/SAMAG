Public kiosks are essential for urban infrastructure, but their touch-based interfaces can be inaccessible to people with disabilities. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a voice-based interface for public kiosks, focusing on users with mobility and dexterity impairments. We developed a conversational UI framework that leverages natural language processing and speech recognition to enable users to interact with kiosks using voice commands. A user study with 30 participants showed that our system significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional touch-based interfaces. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing inclusive public kiosks and highlight future research directions.
