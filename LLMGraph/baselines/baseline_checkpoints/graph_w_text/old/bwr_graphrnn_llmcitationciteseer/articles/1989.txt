In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem, especially when agents have diverse capabilities and tasks have complex constraints. This paper proposes a novel distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) framework for task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We introduce a decentralized DCOP algorithm, 'HeteroAlloc', which leverages local search and communication to efficiently allocate tasks to agents while respecting constraints. Experimental results on a realistic disaster response scenario demonstrate that HeteroAlloc outperforms existing centralized and decentralized approaches in terms of task completion rate, latency, and robustness to agent failures.
