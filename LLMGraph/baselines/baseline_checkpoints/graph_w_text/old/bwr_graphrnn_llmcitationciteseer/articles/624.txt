This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation approach for multi-agent systems using graph neural networks. Our method, called GraphTask, leverages the structural information of the agent communication graph to learn effective task assignments. We formulate the task allocation problem as a graph optimization problem and propose a neural network architecture that can be trained in a decentralized manner. Experimental results on several benchmark scenarios demonstrate that GraphTask outperforms traditional decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
