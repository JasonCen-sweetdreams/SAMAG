Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and high query volumes. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to select the optimal join order and indexing strategy for a given query. Our approach is scalable and can handle complex queries with multiple joins and subqueries. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time.
