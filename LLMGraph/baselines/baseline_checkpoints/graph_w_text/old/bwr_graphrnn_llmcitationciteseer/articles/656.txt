Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the need to balance data distribution and processing costs. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages statistical graph summaries and machine learning-based cost estimation to optimize query plans for distributed graph databases. Our experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt reduces query latency by up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
