Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We designed a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Our results show that users with personalized avatars reported higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and overall satisfaction compared to those with generic avatars. We also found that personalized avatars increased user participation in VR tasks, particularly among users with lower prior experience with VR technology.
