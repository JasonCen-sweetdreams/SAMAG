This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and resources need to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. We employ graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies that take into account the agents' capabilities, resource constraints, and communication limitations. Our approach enables agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and task requirements, and demonstrates improved performance and scalability compared to traditional centralized approaches. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our GNN-based framework.
