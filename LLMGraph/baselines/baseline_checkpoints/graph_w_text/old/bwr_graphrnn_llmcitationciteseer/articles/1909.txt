Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in homes, but their lack of emotional support can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and isolation among vulnerable populations. This paper presents a novel approach to designing inclusive voice assistants that provide persona-based emotional support. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 older adults, using a persona-based voice assistant prototype that acknowledged and validated users' emotions. Our results show significant improvements in user satisfaction and emotional well-being, particularly among participants with depression or anxiety. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing empathetic voice assistants that promote emotional support and social connection.
