Distributed search engines face scalability challenges when processing complex queries. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) technique to improve the efficiency of document retrieval. HQE leverages a two-stage indexing approach, wherein a coarse index is used to rapidly identify candidate documents, followed by a fine-grained index for precise ranking. We introduce a novel scoring function that incorporates term frequency, document frequency, and query similarities to enhance retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HQE achieves a significant reduction in query latency while maintaining a high level of retrieval accuracy.
