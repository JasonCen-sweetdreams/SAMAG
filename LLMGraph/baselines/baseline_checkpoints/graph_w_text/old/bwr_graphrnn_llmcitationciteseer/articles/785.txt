Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with motor impairments often face significant barriers to accessing these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces tailored to the needs of individuals with motor impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to identify key challenges and preferences, and developed a set of guidelines for creating adaptable, intuitive, and accessible VR interfaces. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating user-centered design principles and assistive technologies can significantly improve the VR experience for users with motor impairments.
