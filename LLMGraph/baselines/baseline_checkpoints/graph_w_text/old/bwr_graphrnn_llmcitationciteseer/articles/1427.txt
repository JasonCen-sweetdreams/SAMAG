Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial in various applications, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promise, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explanations through attention weights. Our HAN model consists of a hierarchical encoder that captures multi-scale temporal dependencies and an attention-based decoder that highlights anomalous segments. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies and identifying relevant features.
