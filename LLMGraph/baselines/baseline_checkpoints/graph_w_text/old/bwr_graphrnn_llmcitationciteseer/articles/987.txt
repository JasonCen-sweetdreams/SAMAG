Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a crucial component in various AI applications. However, entity disambiguation remains a challenging task due to the ambiguity of entity names. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph attention networks (GATs) to disambiguate entities in KGs. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that leverages both local and global entity context to identify the correct entity. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 12% in terms of F1-score, and is robust to noisy and missing data.
