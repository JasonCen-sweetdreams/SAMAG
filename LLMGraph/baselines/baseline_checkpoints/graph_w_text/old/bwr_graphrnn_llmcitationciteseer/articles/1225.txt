Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge, particularly in the presence of skewed data distributions. This paper presents a novel query optimization technique that leverages skew-aware join reordering to minimize query latency and improve resource utilization. Our approach incorporates a probabilistic skew estimation model and a cost-based optimization framework to identify the most efficient join order. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that our technique outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
