This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create gestural interfaces that are accessible and usable by older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 older adults and 5 caregivers to identify the challenges and opportunities in designing gestural interfaces for this population. Our findings highlight the importance of accommodating individual differences in motor abilities and providing personalized feedback mechanisms. We propose a set of design guidelines and a novel gesture recognition algorithm that can adapt to varying levels of motor impairment. Our evaluation results show that our approach can improve the accuracy and efficiency of gestural interactions for older adults with motor impairments.
