This paper proposes a novel approach to distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems using hierarchical reinforcement learning. We introduce a hierarchical framework, 'HTA', that enables agents to learn both high-level task assignment policies and low-level action execution strategies. HTA leverages a decentralized actor-critic architecture, where each agent learns to optimize its local reward function while coordinating with neighboring agents to achieve global optimality. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that HTA outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to dynamic environments.
