This paper presents a study on designing inclusive gesture-based interfaces for older adults with motor impairments. We conducted a series of user studies with 20 participants to investigate the effects of gesture speed, size, and complexity on interface usability. Our results show that adaptive gesture recognition systems can significantly improve interaction accuracy and satisfaction for older adults with motor impairments. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive gesture-based interfaces and discuss the implications for accessible human-computer interaction.
