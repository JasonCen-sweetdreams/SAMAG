Data warehousing and indexing are crucial for efficient data analysis, but existing solutions struggle to keep up with the sheer volume and velocity of modern data. This paper presents RAPID, a novel indexing framework that leverages real-time analytics to optimize data warehousing. RAPID employs a hybrid indexing approach, combining column-store and row-store indexing to facilitate fast query processing. We also introduce a dynamic data partitioning strategy that adapts to changing data distributions, ensuring optimal storage and query performance. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RAPID outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in data loading speed.
