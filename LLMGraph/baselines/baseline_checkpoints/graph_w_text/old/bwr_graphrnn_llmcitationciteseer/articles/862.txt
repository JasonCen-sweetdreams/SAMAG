Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize social interactions, but the relationship between embodiment and social presence in VR remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining how varying levels of embodiment in VR affect users' sense of social presence and trust in virtual collaborators. Our results show that users experiencing higher levels of embodiment (e.g., full-body avatars) report increased social presence and trust compared to those with lower levels of embodiment (e.g., text-based representation). We discuss the implications for VR-based social interactions and highlight areas for future research.
