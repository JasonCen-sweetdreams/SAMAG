As smart home devices become increasingly pervasive, securing user authentication remains a pressing concern. This paper proposes a novel gesture-based authentication framework, 'GestAuth', which leverages deep learning to recognize and verify user gestures captured by commodity smart home devices. We introduce a multi-modal fusion approach that combines data from accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer sensors to improve robustness against spoofing attacks. Experimental results on a dataset of 50 users demonstrate that GestAuth achieves an accuracy of 95.2% and outperforms state-of-the-art authentication methods in terms of both security and user experience.
