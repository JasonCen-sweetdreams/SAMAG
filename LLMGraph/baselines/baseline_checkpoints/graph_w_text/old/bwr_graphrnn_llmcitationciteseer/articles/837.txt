In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach, 'GATMA', that leverages graph attention networks to model complex agent interactions and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. By incorporating local observations and communication constraints, GATMA adaptively assigns tasks to agents while minimizing global objective functions. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of GATMA in achieving near-optimal solutions compared to centralized methods, while maintaining scalability and robustness in the face of agent failures.
