This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the agent-task assignment problem as a graph optimization problem, where agents and tasks are represented as nodes, and their interactions are captured by edge weights. Our proposed algorithm, GNN-TA, leverages the expressive power of GNNs to learn effective task allocation strategies in a decentralized manner. Experimental results on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
