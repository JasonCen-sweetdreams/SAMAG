Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, including education, entertainment, and healthcare. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effects of personalized avatar representations on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 120 participants, manipulating avatar appearance, gesture recognition, and personalization levels. Results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, presence, and enjoyment, particularly for female participants. Our findings have implications for the design of inclusive and engaging VR systems.
