Optimizing query execution plans is crucial for improving the performance of distributed database systems. However, existing approaches rely on heuristics or static optimization techniques, which can be suboptimal in dynamic environments. We propose a novel reinforcement learning-based approach, 'QLearn', that adaptively learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the execution environment. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that QLearn outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while also providing robustness to workload changes.
