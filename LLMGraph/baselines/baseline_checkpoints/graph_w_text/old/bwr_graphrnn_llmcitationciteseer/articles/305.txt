Conversational interfaces have the potential to enhance the daily lives of older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing systems often fail to account for the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible conversational interfaces that accommodate cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers, identifying key challenges and opportunities for design innovation. Our proposed framework incorporates features such as simplified dialogue structures, visual cues, and error forgiveness, and is evaluated through a usability study with 20 participants. The results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
