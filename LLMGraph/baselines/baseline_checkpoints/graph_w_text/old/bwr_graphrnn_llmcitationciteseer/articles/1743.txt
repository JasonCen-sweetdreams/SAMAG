This paper presents a novel approach to document retrieval using deep semantic hashing. Our method, called DeepHash, learns a compact binary representation of documents that captures their semantic meaning. We utilize a convolutional neural network to extract features from documents and then employ a hashing layer to generate binary codes. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepHash outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in terms of precision and recall, while significantly reducing storage requirements. We also show that DeepHash can be efficiently indexed and queried using existing inverted index structures.
