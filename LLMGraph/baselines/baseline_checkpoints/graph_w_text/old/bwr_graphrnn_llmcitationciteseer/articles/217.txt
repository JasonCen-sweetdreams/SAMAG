As autonomous vehicles (AVs) become increasingly prevalent, their coordination and negotiation with human-driven vehicles, pedestrians, and other agents on the road become crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) framework, 'AVCoordinator', which enables AVs to learn cooperative policies for complex urban scenarios. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and incorporates a decentralized Q-learning mechanism to facilitate real-time decision-making. Experimental results on a simulated urban environment demonstrate that AVCoordinator reduces congestion, minimizes travel time, and improves overall traffic flow.
