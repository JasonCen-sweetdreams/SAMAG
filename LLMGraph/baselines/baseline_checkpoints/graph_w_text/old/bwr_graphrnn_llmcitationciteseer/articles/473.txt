Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but existing VR interfaces often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework that incorporates auditory and haptic feedback to enable users with visual impairments to navigate and interact with virtual environments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that our proposed framework significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-centric VR interfaces. Our findings have implications for the design of inclusive VR experiences that can benefit a broader range of users.
