Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised concerns. This paper proposes a novel detection method, 'HGN-Detector', which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to identify perturbations in the graph structure. We demonstrate that HGN-Detector outperforms existing methods in detecting targeted attacks on GNNs, while also providing insights into the attack mechanisms. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show that HGN-Detector enables robust GNN-based models, thereby ensuring reliable performance in real-world applications.
