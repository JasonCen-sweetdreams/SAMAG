Autonomous traffic control systems aim to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion by coordinating the actions of individual vehicles. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for multi-agent systems, where agents learn to optimize traffic signal control and vehicle routing simultaneously. We introduce a novel hierarchical architecture that integrates a high-level traffic signal controller with low-level vehicle routing agents, enabling the system to adapt to changing traffic conditions and optimize overall traffic flow. Experiments on a realistic traffic simulation platform demonstrate significant improvements in traffic throughput and reduced congestion compared to existing decentralized approaches.
