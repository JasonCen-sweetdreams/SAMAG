Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data centers, but optimizing query execution in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called QOptRL, learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on query execution time. We demonstrate that QOptRL outperforms traditional query optimizers in terms of execution time and scalability, while adapting to changing database workloads. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that QOptRL reduces query execution time by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
