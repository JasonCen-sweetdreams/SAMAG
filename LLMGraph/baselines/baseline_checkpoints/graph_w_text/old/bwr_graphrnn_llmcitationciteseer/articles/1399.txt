Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it can significantly improve the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, dubbed 'DeepQE'. We leverage a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn a dense representation of the query and its related terms. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. We also show that DeepQE is robust to noisy queries and can be easily integrated into existing IR systems.
