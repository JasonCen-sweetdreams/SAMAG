Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph-based machine learning, where only a limited number of labeled nodes are available for training. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that learns to aggregate node features at multiple scales, enabling effective node classification in few-shot settings. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to adaptively focus on relevant node neighborhoods and a meta-learning framework to adapt to new graph distributions. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAN over state-of-the-art few-shot node classification methods.
