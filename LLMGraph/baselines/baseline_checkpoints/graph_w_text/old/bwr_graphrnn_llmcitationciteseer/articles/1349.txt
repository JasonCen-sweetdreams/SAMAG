Graph pattern matching has become a crucial task in various applications, including social network analysis and knowledge graph querying. However, existing approaches are limited by their scalability and inability to handle large-scale relational databases. This paper presents a novel distributed framework, 'GPMatch', which leverages relational database management systems to efficiently process graph pattern matching queries. GPMatch exploits data locality and parallel processing to achieve significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the scalability and efficacy of GPMatch in processing complex graph patterns.
