Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but they often rely on limited query representations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepSEM', which leverages deep semantic embeddings to capture nuanced query relationships. By integrating DeepSEM with a neural ranking model, we demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness on several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we show that DeepSEM can be efficiently computed using a hierarchical clustering approach, making it scalable for large-scale retrieval applications.
