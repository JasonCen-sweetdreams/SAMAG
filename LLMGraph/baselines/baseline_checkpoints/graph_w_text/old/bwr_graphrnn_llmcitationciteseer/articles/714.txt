Distributed databases are increasingly prevalent, but query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of join ordering and indexing. This paper presents 'RL-Optimizer', a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively adjust query plans based on runtime feedback. Our approach integrates a deep Q-network with a cost-based optimizer to efficiently explore the query plan space. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
