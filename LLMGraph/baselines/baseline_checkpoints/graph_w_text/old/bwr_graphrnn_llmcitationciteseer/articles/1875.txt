Recommender systems have become a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms. However, traditional matrix factorization and neural network-based approaches struggle to scale with the growth of user-item interactions. This paper introduces HGAN, a hierarchical graph attention network that models complex relationships between users, items, and their interactions. HGAN employs a novel attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant graph neighborhoods, enabling efficient processing of massive graphs. Our experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and scalability, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 15%.
