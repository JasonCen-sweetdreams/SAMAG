In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to allocate tasks in a distributed manner. Our proposed framework, 'DRL-Assign', uses a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn optimal task assignment policies for individual agents. We evaluate DRL-Assign in a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
