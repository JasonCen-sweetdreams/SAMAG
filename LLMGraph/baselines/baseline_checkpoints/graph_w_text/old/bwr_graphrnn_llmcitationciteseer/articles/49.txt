Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to enhance the accuracy of search results by incorporating relevant terms into the original query. This paper presents a novel approach, 'NeuroExp', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. By fine-tuning a pre-trained language model on a large corpus of text, NeuroExp generates expanded queries that better capture the underlying information needs of users. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming traditional query expansion methods and state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
