In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for optimizing system performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to distributed task allocation using reinforcement learning. We model the task allocation problem as a Markov decision process and develop a decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm that enables agents to learn optimal task assignment strategies. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and system efficiency.
