Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HDCluster', which leverages hierarchical density-based clustering to group similar passages and reduce the search space. Our method exploits the hierarchical structure of the clusters to prune irrelevant passages and focus on the most promising candidates. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDCluster achieves significant improvements in both retrieval efficiency and answer accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
