In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents to maximize system efficiency. However, when agents are self-interested, they may not act in the best interest of the system. This paper proposes a novel framework for distributed task allocation using stochastic games, where agents learn to make decisions based on their individual payoffs. We model the system as a Markov game and use reinforcement learning to find the Nash equilibrium. Our approach improves system efficiency by up to 25% compared to centralized allocation methods, while also ensuring fairness among agents. We evaluate our framework using a real-world logistics scenario and demonstrate its scalability and robustness.
