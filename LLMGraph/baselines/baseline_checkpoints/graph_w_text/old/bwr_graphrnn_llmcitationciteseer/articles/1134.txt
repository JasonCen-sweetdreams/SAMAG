Explainability is crucial in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as it enables understanding of complex decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework for MARL, which incorporates explainable AI (XAI) techniques. Our HAN model consists of two levels of attention: agent-level attention for identifying relevant agents and state-level attention for focusing on critical state features. Experimental results on a variety of MARL benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only improves overall performance but also provides meaningful explanations of agent behavior.
