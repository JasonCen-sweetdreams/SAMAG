Information retrieval systems struggle to efficiently retrieve relevant documents, particularly in large-scale collections. We propose a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HiRank', which leverages both local and global semantic features to improve retrieval efficiency. HiRank utilizes a multi-level attention mechanism to adaptively focus on relevant document regions, reducing the need for exhaustive document scoring. Our experiments on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that HiRank achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy.
