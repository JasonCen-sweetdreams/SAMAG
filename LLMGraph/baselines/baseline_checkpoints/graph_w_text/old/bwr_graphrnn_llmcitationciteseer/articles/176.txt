This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Our approach leverages distributed constraint optimization to efficiently allocate tasks to agents with varying capabilities and resource constraints. We propose a hybrid algorithm that combines constraint propagation with a novel heuristic for adaptively adjusting agent assignments. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing task completion time and improving overall system efficiency.
