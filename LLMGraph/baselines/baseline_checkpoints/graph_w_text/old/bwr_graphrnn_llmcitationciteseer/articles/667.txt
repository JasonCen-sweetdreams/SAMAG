This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed an experiment to investigate how users' cognitive loads are affected by varying levels of gestural agency in a VR-based problem-solving task. Our results show that users with higher gestural agency exhibit improved task performance and reduced cognitive load, suggesting that embodied cognition plays a significant role in VR interaction. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of more intuitive and effective VR interfaces.
