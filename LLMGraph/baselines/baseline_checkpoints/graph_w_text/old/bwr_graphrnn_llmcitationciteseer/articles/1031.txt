Distributed database systems (DDS) have become ubiquitous in modern data-intensive applications. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query planning and the dynamic nature of data distributions. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment, and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing query latency and improving resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup show that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based optimization methods by up to 30%.
