Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to optimize query plans based on the database's workload and system dynamics. Our approach, called 'DQN-Opt', adaptively selects the most efficient query plan from a set of candidates, considering factors such as execution time, resource utilization, and data locality. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that DQN-Opt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x and reducing resource utilization by 30%.
