Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. We propose a multimodal approach that combines auditory, haptic, and tactile feedback to facilitate navigation and interaction in VR environments. Our user study with 20 visually impaired participants demonstrates significant improvements in navigation accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional visual-based interfaces.
