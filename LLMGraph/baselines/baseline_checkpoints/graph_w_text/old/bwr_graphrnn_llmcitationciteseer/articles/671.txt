This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent system for real-time traffic management, where autonomous agents cooperate to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. Our approach leverages a novel combination of graph-based planning and deep reinforcement learning to enable agents to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions and coordinate with neighboring agents. Experimental results on a simulated urban traffic network demonstrate a 23% reduction in average travel time and a 17% decrease in congestion compared to traditional centralized traffic management systems.
