Emotion recognition from multi-modal data (e.g., speech, text, vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features for emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of three levels of attention: modality-level, feature-level, and instance-level. We evaluate our approach on the CMU-MOSEI dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in emotion recognition accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
