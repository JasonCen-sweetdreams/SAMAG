Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepQuery', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion. By formulating query expansion as a Markov decision process, we train an agent to select the most informative expansion terms based on the current query context. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQuery outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while requiring fewer expansion terms and reducing computational overhead.
