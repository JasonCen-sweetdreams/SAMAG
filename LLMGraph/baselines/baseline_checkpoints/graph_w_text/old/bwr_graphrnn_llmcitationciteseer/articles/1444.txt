Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) have gained popularity for uncertainty estimation in various applications, including time-series forecasting. However, their scalability remains a significant challenge for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, 'BatchEnsemble', which leverages batch normalization and ensemble methods to enable scalable BNNs. Our approach reduces computational complexity while maintaining accurate uncertainty estimates. We evaluate BatchEnsemble on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and forecasting performance.
