This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated multi-agent pathfinding that incorporates real-time traffic awareness. Our algorithm, dubbed 'TrafficAware-CMAPF', leverages streaming traffic data to dynamically adjust agent routes and mitigate congestion. We introduce a decentralized, auction-based mechanism that enables agents to negotiate and adapt their paths in response to changing traffic conditions. Experimental results on a simulated urban transportation network demonstrate significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional, statically-planned CMAPF methods.
