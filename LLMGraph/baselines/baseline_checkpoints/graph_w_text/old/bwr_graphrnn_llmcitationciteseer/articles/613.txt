Route planning for autonomous vehicles poses a complex problem due to the vast number of possible routes and dynamic traffic conditions. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HRL-Route', that decomposes the route planning problem into a series of sub-problems, each tackled by a specialized agent. We introduce a novel attention mechanism that enables the agents to focus on relevant traffic features and adapt to changing conditions. Experimental results on a simulated urban environment demonstrate that HRL-Route outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of route efficiency, safety, and adaptability.
