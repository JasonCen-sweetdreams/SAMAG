This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, QueryDocNet, which leverages the strengths of both lexical and semantic matching in ad-hoc retrieval. QueryDocNet employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture complex query-document relationships and incorporates a term gating module to adaptively weight term importance. Our experiments on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate that QueryDocNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of mean average precision and NDCG@10. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the model's performance under varying query lengths and document types.
