Public displays are increasingly ubiquitous, yet authentication mechanisms for these devices remain inadequate. This paper presents EyeGazeAuth, a novel gaze-based authentication system that leverages users' eye movements to verify their identity. Our approach combines computer vision techniques with machine learning algorithms to analyze gaze patterns and detect authentication attempts. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating an accuracy rate of 92.5% and a false acceptance rate of 5.2%. EyeGazeAuth offers a convenient, non-intrusive, and secure alternative to traditional authentication methods for public displays.
