Dialogue management is a crucial component of conversational agents. This paper proposes a novel hybrid agent architecture that integrates task-oriented and social conversational dialogue management. Our approach employs a hierarchical state machine to model task-oriented dialogue flows and a neural network-based social chat module to generate engaging responses. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale human-agent dialogue dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in task success rate and user satisfaction compared to traditional task-oriented or social dialogue management methods. The proposed architecture has implications for developing more effective and engaging conversational agents in various domains.
