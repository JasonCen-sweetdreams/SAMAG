Query expansion is a crucial step in retrieval systems, but it can be computationally expensive for large document collections. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE', which leverages a multi-level indexing structure to efficiently identify relevant terms and documents. HQE first applies a coarse-grained expansion at the topic level, followed by a fine-grained expansion at the document level, using a probabilistic relevance model. Experimental results on the TREC ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
