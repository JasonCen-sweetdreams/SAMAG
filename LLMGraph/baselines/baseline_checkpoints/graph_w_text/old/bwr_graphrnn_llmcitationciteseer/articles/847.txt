Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are increasingly used to index and query large-scale document collections. However, the high communication overhead between nodes can significantly impact query efficiency. This paper proposes a novel approach to reduce communication costs by applying hierarchical clustering to the document collection. We introduce a clustering algorithm that takes into account both document similarity and node proximity, and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing query latency and improving system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach achieves significant performance gains compared to existing DIR systems.
