Distributed database systems are critical for modern applications, but optimizing query execution remains a complex task. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. We design a Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework that models query execution as a sequence of actions, and train an agent to learn optimal query plans through trial and error. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time, while maintaining similar accuracy.
