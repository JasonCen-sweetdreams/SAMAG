This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating gestural interfaces that are accessible and usable by older adults with dementia. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with caregivers and individuals with dementia to identify key design principles and guidelines. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and feedback in gestural interfaces. We developed a prototype system that incorporates these principles and evaluated its effectiveness in a controlled study. The results show that our interface design can significantly improve the interaction experience for older adults with dementia, enabling them to engage in meaningful activities and enhance their overall well-being.
