In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, traditional methods often rely on centralized controllers or simplifying assumptions about agent interactions. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model complex agent relationships and task dependencies. We introduce a novel GNN-based algorithm that enables agents to learn and adapt to changing task requirements and network topologies. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and system resilience compared to state-of-the-art decentralized methods.
