Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to improve the retrieval quality by adding relevant terms to the initial query. Traditional query expansion methods rely on statistical techniques, which may not capture the complex semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'NeuroExp', which leverages neural networks to learn a dense representation of query terms and expand the query with relevant words. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExp outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
