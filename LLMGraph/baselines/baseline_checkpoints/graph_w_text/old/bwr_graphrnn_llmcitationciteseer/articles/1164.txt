Few-shot image classification is a challenging task, where models are required to generalize to new classes with limited training samples. This paper proposes a novel deep adaptive metric learning approach, 'DAML', which learns to adapt the distance metric based on the class relationships and sample distributions. DAML consists of a meta-learning framework that optimizes the metric learning module using a task-aware loss function. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DAML achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing few-shot learning methods by a significant margin.
