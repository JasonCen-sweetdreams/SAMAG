Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select the most efficient execution plan based on the query workload, system resources, and data distribution. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
