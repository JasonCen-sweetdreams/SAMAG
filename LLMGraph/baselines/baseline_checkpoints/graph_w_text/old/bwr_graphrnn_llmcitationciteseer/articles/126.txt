Autonomous vehicles rely on accurate object detection to ensure safe navigation. While AI-based detectors have improved significantly, they still struggle with rare or unexpected events. This paper proposes a novel human-AI collaboration framework, 'CoPilot', which leverages human intuition to correct AI mistakes in real-time. We develop an attention-based neural network that integrates human feedback and AI predictions, achieving a 25% reduction in false negatives compared to state-of-the-art detectors. Our user study demonstrates that CoPilot improves human trust and satisfaction in autonomous vehicles.
