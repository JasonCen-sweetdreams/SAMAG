Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction. However, gesture recognition in VR remains a challenging task, particularly in terms of feedback provision. This study investigates the impact of multimodal feedback on user performance and experience in VR-based gesture recognition systems. We designed and implemented a VR system that incorporates visual, auditory, and haptic feedback, and conducted a user study with 30 participants. Results show that multimodal feedback significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and reduces user frustration. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the combination of visual and haptic feedback is most effective in enhancing user experience.
