Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data processing, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed settings. Our method, 'RL-QOpt', leverages a deep Q-network to learn the optimal join order and indexing strategies based on query patterns and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional cost-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
