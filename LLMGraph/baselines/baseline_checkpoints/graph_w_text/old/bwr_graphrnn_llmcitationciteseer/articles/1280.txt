Explainability is a crucial aspect of multi-agent reinforcement learning, where agents interact with each other and their environment to achieve a common goal. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that facilitates explainable decision-making in multi-agent systems. HAN consists of two levels of attention: agent-level attention, which focuses on relevant agents in the environment, and action-level attention, which highlights the most critical actions contributing to the reward. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN on a range of multi-agent environments, including traffic management and robotic soccer, and show that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both performance and interpretability.
