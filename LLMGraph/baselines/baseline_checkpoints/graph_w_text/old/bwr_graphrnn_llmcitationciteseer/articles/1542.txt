Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice-based interfaces for this demographic. We conducted a series of interviews and usability studies to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel design framework, 'CognitiveVoice', which incorporates simplified language processing, visual cues, and adaptive error correction. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice-based interfaces.
