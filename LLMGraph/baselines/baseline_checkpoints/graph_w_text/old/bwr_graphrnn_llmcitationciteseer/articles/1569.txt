Distributed column-stores have become a popular choice for big data analytics, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents Delta-Key, a novel indexing technique that leverages the benefits of column-store compression and partitioning to accelerate query processing. By maintaining a compact, delta-encoded index of column values, Delta-Key enables fast lookup and filtering, reducing query latency by up to 3x compared to existing indexing methods. We evaluate Delta-Key on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in various query workloads.
