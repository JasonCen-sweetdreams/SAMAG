In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient decision-making to achieve complex goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the underlying structure of the agent network and allocate tasks accordingly. Our approach, called 'GNN-TA', uses a distributed GNN architecture to learn node representations that capture the capabilities and constraints of each agent, and a novel task allocation algorithm that minimizes global cost while ensuring fairness and robustness. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-TA in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead compared to traditional decentralized approaches.
