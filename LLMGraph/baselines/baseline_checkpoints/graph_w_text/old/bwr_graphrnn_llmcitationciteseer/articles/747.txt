Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide transparent and trustworthy suggestions to users. One crucial component of ERS is knowledge graph embedding (KGE), which captures complex relationships between entities. We propose a novel KGE method, 'KG-Explain', that leverages a graph attention mechanism to learn entity representations. KG-Explain outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving higher recommendation accuracy and providing more informative explanations. Our approach has promising applications in personalized recommendation systems, especially in domains like e-commerce and healthcare.
