Voice assistants have revolutionized home automation, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing accessible voice assistants tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with mild cognitive impairments, identifying key design recommendations for voice assistant interfaces, such as simplified dialogue flows, error forgiveness, and multimodal feedback. Our prototype, 'EasySpeak', demonstrates improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants. Our findings have implications for enhancing the accessibility of voice assistants in the context of aging-in-place.
