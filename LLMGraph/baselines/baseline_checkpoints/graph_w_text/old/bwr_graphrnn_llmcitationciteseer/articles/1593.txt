In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the complex dependencies between agents and tasks. Our approach, called GNN-Allocator, leverages the strengths of GNNs in modeling graph-structured data to optimize task allocations in real-time. We evaluate GNN-Allocator on a set of simulated scenarios and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving system throughput and reducing latency compared to traditional decentralized allocation methods.
