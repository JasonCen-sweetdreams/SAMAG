Sentiment analysis on multi-aspect data often suffers from the curse of dimensionality and aspect-related ambiguity. To tackle this, we propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HiGAT) that integrates graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between aspects and their sentiments. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in aspect-level sentiment prediction, achieved by 2.5% higher F1-score and 3.2% higher AUC-ROC. We also provide theoretical insights into the interpretability of HiGAT, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.
