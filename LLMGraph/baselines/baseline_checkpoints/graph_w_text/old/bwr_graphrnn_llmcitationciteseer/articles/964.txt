Voice assistants have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but older adults often struggle to use them effectively due to cognitive, sensory, and motor impairments. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction framework, 'EasyVoice', which enhances accessibility and usability for older adults. EasyVoice incorporates speech recognition, natural language processing, and computer vision to provide a more intuitive and flexible interaction experience. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults and found that EasyVoice significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants. Our framework has implications for promoting digital inclusion and independent living among older adults.
