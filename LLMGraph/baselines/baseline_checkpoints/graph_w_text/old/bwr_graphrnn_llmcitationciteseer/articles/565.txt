In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to enable autonomous task allocation among agents. Our method, called Agent-TA, employs a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn task allocation policies that adapt to dynamic environments and varying agent capabilities. Experimental results in a simulated robotics domain demonstrate that Agent-TA outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in terms of task completion rate and agent utilization.
