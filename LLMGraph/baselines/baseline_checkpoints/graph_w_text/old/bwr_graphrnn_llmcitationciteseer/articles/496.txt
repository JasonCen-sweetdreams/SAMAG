Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely on effective query expansion techniques to capture user intent. This paper presents a novel neural embedding-based approach, termed 'NeuroExpand', which leverages semantic relationships between query terms to generate high-quality expansion candidates. Our method employs a graph attention network to model term co-occurrences and learns a dense representation space for query terms. Experimental results on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroExpand outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness to query ambiguity.
