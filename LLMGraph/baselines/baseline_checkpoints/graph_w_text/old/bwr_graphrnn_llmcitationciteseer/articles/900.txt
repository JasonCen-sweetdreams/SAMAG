As autonomous systems increasingly interact with humans, the need for transparent decision-making processes grows. This paper introduces HAN-MAD, a novel hierarchical attention network architecture for multi-agent decision making. HAN-MAD incorporates attention mechanisms at both the agent and group levels, enabling the identification of influential agents and factors in the decision-making process. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate that HAN-MAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of decision accuracy and explainability, while providing insights into the complex interactions between agents.
