Scalable recommendation systems are crucial for modern e-commerce platforms, but most existing approaches struggle to balance model complexity and computational efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture that leverages both local and global node representations to capture complex item relationships. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN on three real-world datasets, achieving significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and reduced computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art graph-based methods.
