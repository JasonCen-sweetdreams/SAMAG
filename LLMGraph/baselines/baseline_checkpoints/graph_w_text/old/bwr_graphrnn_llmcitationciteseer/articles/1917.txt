Industrial IoT systems generate vast amounts of time-series data, making anomaly detection a crucial task for ensuring system reliability. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for time-series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and hierarchical structures in the data. We also propose a novel loss function that incorporates both reconstruction and adversarial losses to improve anomaly detection performance. Experimental results on a real-world industrial dataset demonstrate that our HAN approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of AUC-ROC and detection accuracy.
