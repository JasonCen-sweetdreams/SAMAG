Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained increasing attention in recent years. However, most existing ERS models rely on shallow, flat representations of user-item interactions, neglecting the complex relationships between items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture, which models user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph and applies attention mechanisms to capture multi-level dependencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the learned attention weights, offering insights into the decision-making process of the model.
