Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it helps to improve the quality of search results. However, traditional query expansion methods rely on manual feature engineering and may not effectively capture the semantic relationships between words. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach to query expansion, called DQE, which leverages neural networks to learn context-aware word embeddings and generate expanded queries. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that DQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while requiring minimal manual intervention.
