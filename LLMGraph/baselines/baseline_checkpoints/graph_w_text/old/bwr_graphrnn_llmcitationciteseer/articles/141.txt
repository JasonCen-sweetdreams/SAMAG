In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, existing methods often struggle with scalability and adaptability to changing environmental conditions. We propose a novel approach based on graph attention networks (GATs) that learns to allocate tasks to agents in a decentralized manner. Our method, dubbed 'GAT-MA', leverages attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of neighboring agents and tasks, enabling efficient communication and coordination. Experimental results on simulated urban search and rescue scenarios demonstrate that GAT-MA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and overall system throughput.
