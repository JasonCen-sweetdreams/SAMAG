Distributed knowledge graph databases have become increasingly popular for scalable storage and querying of large-scale graph data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization, 'DistroOpt', which leverages both statistical and semantic properties of the graph data to efficiently prune the search space. We introduce a probabilistic cost model that accurately estimates the cost of subqueries and a semantic-aware subquery ordering strategy that minimizes the number of joins. Experimental results on a real-world knowledge graph dataset demonstrate that DistroOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
