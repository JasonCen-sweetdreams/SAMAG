Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for businesses to make timely decisions. However, the complexity of modern data warehouses poses significant challenges to query optimization. This paper proposes an adaptive query optimization framework, 'AQOR', that leverages machine learning and statistical modeling to dynamically adjust query execution plans. AQOR incorporates a novel cost model that captures the nuances of real-time data warehousing and adapts to changing workloads and data distributions. Experiments on a large-scale retail dataset demonstrate that AQOR reduces query latency by up to 50% compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
