Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, especially when dealing with ambiguous or incomplete queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of query terms and documents. Our method utilizes a self-attention mechanism to identify relevant context and expand queries with synthetically generated terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
