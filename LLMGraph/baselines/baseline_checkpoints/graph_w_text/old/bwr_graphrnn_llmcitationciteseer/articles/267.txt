Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs, such as text, speech, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the heterogeneity of modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of each modality to recognize emotions more accurately. Our HAN model consists of three layers: modality-specific attention, cross-modal attention, and emotion-aware attention. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal inputs, achieving an average F1-score of 0.842.
