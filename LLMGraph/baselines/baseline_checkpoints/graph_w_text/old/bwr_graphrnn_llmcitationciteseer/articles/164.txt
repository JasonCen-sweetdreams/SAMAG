Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in online platforms, but their opacity hinders trust and understanding. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that not only improves recommendation accuracy but also provides explainable insights into user preferences. HGAT models user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph, where attention mechanisms capture complex relationships between items and user clusters. We evaluate HGAT on three real-world datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in recommendation quality and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
