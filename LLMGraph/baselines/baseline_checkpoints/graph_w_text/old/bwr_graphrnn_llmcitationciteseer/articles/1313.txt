Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on term co-occurrence or semantic similarity, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HiDE', which leverages hierarchical document embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and documents. By representing documents as dense, hierarchical vectors, HiDE enables efficient and effective query expansion, even for verbose or ambiguous queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
