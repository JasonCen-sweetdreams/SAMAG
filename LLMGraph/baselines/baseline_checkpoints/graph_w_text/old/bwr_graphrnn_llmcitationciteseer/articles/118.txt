This paper proposes a novel neural graph-based query graph model for efficient document ranking in information retrieval systems. Our approach, called NeuralGraph-QG, leverages graph neural networks to learn query-dependent document representations, enabling more accurate relevance scoring. We introduce a hierarchical graph attention mechanism to capture both local and global context in query-document interactions. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuralGraph-QG outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
