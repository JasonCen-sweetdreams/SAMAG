In complex, dynamic environments, autonomous agents must cooperate to achieve shared goals. This paper presents a novel framework for coalition formation among heterogeneous agents, enabling efficient task allocation in response to changing environmental conditions. Our approach integrates machine learning-based prediction of task requirements with a distributed, anytime algorithm for coalition formation. Experimental results in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing methods.
