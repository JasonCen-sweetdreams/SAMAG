Optimizing database queries is crucial for efficient big data analytics. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to automatically generate efficient query plans. Our framework, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that maps queries to optimal execution plans. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a range of big data benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques. Our approach has the potential to revolutionize big data analytics by enabling faster and more efficient insights from large-scale datasets.
