The increasing adoption of real-time systems in safety-critical domains has created a pressing need for robustness against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect such attacks using explainable graph neural networks (GNNs). We design a GNN architecture that learns to identify attack patterns in graph-structured data, while providing interpretable explanations for its decisions. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art detection algorithms on a benchmark dataset, achieving an F1-score of 0.95. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a real-world scenario, detecting attacks on a smart grid system with high accuracy and low latency.
