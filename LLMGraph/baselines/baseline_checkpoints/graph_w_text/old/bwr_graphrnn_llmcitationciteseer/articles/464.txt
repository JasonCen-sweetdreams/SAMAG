Distributed systems often suffer from load imbalance, leading to performance degradation and resource underutilization. This paper proposes a novel agent-based load balancing approach, 'AgentLB', which leverages autonomous agents to dynamically allocate tasks to nodes based on their current workload and capabilities. We introduce a decentralized coordination mechanism that enables agents to adapt to changing system conditions and optimize load balancing in real-time. Experimental results on a simulated cloud computing environment show that AgentLB achieves significant improvements in system throughput, response time, and resource utilization compared to traditional load balancing algorithms.
