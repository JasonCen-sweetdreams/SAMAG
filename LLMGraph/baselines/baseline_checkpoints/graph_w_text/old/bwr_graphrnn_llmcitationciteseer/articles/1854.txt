Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches struggle to scale with large datasets. We propose a novel framework, GraphED, which leverages graph-based embeddings and distributed indexing to efficiently disambiguate entities. Our approach represents entities as dense vectors in a learned embedding space, enabling fast similarity computations. We further develop a distributed indexing scheme that partitions the entity graph into smaller subgraphs, allowing for parallel processing and significant speedups. Experimental results on a large-scale knowledge graph dataset demonstrate GraphED's ability to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while reducing computation time by up to 75%.
