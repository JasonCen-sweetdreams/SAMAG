Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR experiences that cater to users with visual impairments. We conducted a user study to identify the challenges faced by visually impaired users in VR environments and developed a set of guidelines for accessible VR design. Our framework incorporates audio-based navigation, haptic feedback, and personalized assistance to facilitate an immersive and inclusive VR experience. We evaluated our approach with a prototype VR system and found significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction.
