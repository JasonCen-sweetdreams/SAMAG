Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it aims to refine the initial query to retrieve more relevant documents. Traditional query expansion methods rely on hand-crafted rules or statistical models, which may not generalize well to diverse query types and domains. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'RL-QE', which learns to expand queries by optimizing a reward function that balances precision and recall. Our approach leverages a neural network to predict the relevance of expansion terms and a reinforcement learning policy to select the most effective expansion strategy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance.
