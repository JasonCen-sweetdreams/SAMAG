This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents must satisfy temporal logic constraints to achieve complex tasks. We introduce a distributed algorithm, 'TL-MAP', that leverages model checking techniques to verify task feasibility and allocate tasks efficiently. TL-MAP enables agents to autonomously adjust their plans in response to changes in the environment, ensuring robustness and adaptability in dynamic scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TL-MAP in a simulated urban search and rescue application, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate and latency.
