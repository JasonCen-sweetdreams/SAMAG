Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval to improve the retrieval effectiveness. Traditional query expansion techniques rely on manual rules or statistical methods, which often fail to capture the nuances of natural language. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, which leverages a keyword extraction model to identify relevant terms from the query context. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that incorporates both local and global contextual information to predict the importance of each term. Experimental results on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving up to 15% improvement in retrieval accuracy.
