Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities must be assigned to tasks to maximize efficiency. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent-task interactions. Our approach, called GNN-ATA, learns to predict task assignments based on agent features, task requirements, and communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-ATA in various scenarios, including heterogeneous agent teams and dynamic task environments, outperforming traditional optimization-based methods in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency.
