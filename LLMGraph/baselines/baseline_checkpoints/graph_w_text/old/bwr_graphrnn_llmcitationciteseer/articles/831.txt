Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, optimizing queries for these databases remains a challenging problem, especially at scale. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for rewriting queries. Experimental results on a large-scale graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
