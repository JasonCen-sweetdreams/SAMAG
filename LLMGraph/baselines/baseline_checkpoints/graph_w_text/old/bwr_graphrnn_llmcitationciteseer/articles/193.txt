In multi-agent systems, decision-making processes often involve complex interactions and unclear decision boundaries. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that facilitates explainable decision-making in multi-agent environments. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agent interactions and identify influential factors driving decision outcomes. Experimental results on a real-world autonomous vehicle dataset demonstrate improved decision-making performance and interpretability compared to traditional deep reinforcement learning methods.
