Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed indexing. This paper presents a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'DIH', which combines the benefits of centralized and decentralized indexing techniques. DIH leverages a hierarchical indexing structure to efficiently process complex queries, reducing the number of network round-trips and improving overall system performance. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database setup demonstrate that DIH outperforms existing indexing solutions, achieving an average query response time reduction of 35%.
