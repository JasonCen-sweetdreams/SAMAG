Lane changing is a critical task in autonomous driving, requiring complex decision-making and precise control. This paper introduces a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HiRLC', which decomposes lane changing into a hierarchical sequence of tasks. Our approach combines a high-level policy network with a low-level control network, enabling the agent to learn both when to change lanes and how to execute the maneuver. We evaluate HiRLC on a realistic simulation platform and demonstrate significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and adaptability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
