Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed graph databases. We develop a graph neural network (GNN) that learns to predict the optimal query plan based on the graph structure and query patterns. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
