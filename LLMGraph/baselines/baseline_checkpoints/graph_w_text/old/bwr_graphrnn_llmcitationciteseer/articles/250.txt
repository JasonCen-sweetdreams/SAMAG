Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'TenantAware', which leverages machine learning-based techniques to optimize query plans for individual tenants. Our approach incorporates a tenant profiling mechanism that captures workload characteristics and adapts to changing query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant dataset demonstrate that TenantAware achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
