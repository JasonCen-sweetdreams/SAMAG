Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained prominence in recent years, but most existing methods rely on simplistic feature attribution or perturbation-based techniques. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HiGAT) architecture, which embeds item relationships and user preferences in a hierarchical graph structure. HiGAT generates personalized explanations for each recommendation by propagating attention weights through the graph, providing insights into the reasoning process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HiGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
