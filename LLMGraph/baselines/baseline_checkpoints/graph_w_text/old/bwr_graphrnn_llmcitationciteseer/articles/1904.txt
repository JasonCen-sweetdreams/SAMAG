Modern search engines rely heavily on neural retrieval models to improve the ranking of documents. However, these models often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel neural retrieval model, dubbed 'EffiRank', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to efficiently rank documents. We demonstrate that EffiRank achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while reducing computational costs by up to 40% compared to existing models. Furthermore, we investigate the effectiveness of EffiRank in real-world search engine scenarios, showcasing its potential to improve user experience and reduce latency.
