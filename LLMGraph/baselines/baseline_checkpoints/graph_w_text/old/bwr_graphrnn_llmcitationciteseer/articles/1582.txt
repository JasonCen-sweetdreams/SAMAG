Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data management tasks. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan. Our experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate a significant reduction in query execution time compared to traditional optimization techniques. We also explore the adaptability of our approach to dynamic workload changes and variable database configurations.
