Query reformulation is a crucial step in information retrieval, aiming to transform an initial query into a more effective one. Existing methods rely on handcrafted rules or machine learning models that require extensive feature engineering. We propose a novel approach, DeepQR, which leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn query reformulation policies. Our agent learns to reformulate queries by interacting with a simulated search engine, receiving rewards based on the relevance of retrieved documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQR outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness to query variations.
