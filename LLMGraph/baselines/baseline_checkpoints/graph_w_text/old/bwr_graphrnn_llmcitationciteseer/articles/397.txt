Distributed database systems are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given query and database configuration. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world dataset and show that it outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
