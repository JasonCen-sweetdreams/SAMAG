This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to create more intuitive and engaging user experiences. We designed a gesture-based interaction system, 'ECHO', which leverages the cognitive benefits of bodily engagement to improve user performance and satisfaction in VR environments. Our user study demonstrates that ECHO outperforms traditional controller-based interfaces in terms of task completion time and user satisfaction, while also reducing cognitive load and motion sickness. The results have implications for the design of immersive VR experiences in fields such as education, training, and entertainment.
