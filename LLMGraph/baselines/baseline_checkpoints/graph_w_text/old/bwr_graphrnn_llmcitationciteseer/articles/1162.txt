Recommender systems have become indispensable for personalized experiences in e-commerce and online services. However, scaling these systems to accommodate large user bases and item catalogs remains a significant challenge. This paper presents HGAT, a novel hierarchical graph attention network that efficiently captures complex relationships between users and items. By leveraging a hierarchical graph structure, HGAT reduces the computational complexity of attention mechanisms, enabling real-time recommendations on large datasets. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
