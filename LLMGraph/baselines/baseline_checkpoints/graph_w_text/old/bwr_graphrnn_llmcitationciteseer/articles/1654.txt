Coordinating multiple agents to achieve a common goal is a challenging problem in autonomous systems. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HRL-MAS', which enables agents to learn complex behaviors while adapting to dynamic environments. HRL-MAS consists of a high-level planner that allocates tasks to agents and a low-level controller that executes the tasks using reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HRL-MAS in a simulated warehouse scenario, where multiple robots must work together to pick and deliver packages efficiently.
