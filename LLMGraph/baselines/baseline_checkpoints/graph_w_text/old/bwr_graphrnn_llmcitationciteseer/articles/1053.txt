Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database state and query workload. We evaluate RL-Opt on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
