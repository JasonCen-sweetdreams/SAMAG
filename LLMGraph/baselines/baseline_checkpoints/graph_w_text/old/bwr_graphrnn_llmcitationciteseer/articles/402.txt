Explainability is crucial in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as it enables understanding of agent decision-making. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework for MARL, which incorporates attention mechanisms at both the agent and team levels. Our approach allows for interpretable policy explanations by identifying key agents, states, and actions contributing to team rewards. We evaluate HAN on a range of MARL benchmarks, demonstrating improved explainability and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
