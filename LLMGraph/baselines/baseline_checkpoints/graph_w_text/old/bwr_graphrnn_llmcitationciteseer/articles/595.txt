Optimizing query execution plans is crucial for improving the performance of distributed relational databases. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed databases. Our method, called 'RL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan given a query and the database's current state. We evaluate RL-QO on the TPC-DS benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time compared to traditional optimization techniques. Moreover, RL-QO adapts to changing database workloads and can generalize to unseen queries.
