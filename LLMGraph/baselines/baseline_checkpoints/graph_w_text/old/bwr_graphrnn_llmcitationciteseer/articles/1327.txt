Optimizing query execution in distributed database systems is crucial for improving performance and reducing latency. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to learn optimal query plans. Our method, 'RLQO', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that maps query patterns to optimal execution plans. We evaluate RLQO on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques. Our approach is robust to workload changes and can adapt to dynamic query patterns, making it a promising solution for large-scale distributed databases.
