Few-shot node classification is a challenging problem in graph learning, where only a few labeled nodes are available for training. Existing methods often rely on meta-learning or-transfer learning, which can be computationally expensive and require large amounts of data. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that adaptively selects relevant nodes and features for few-shot classification. HGAT uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global graph structures, and leverages self-supervised learning to improve robustness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, with significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency.
