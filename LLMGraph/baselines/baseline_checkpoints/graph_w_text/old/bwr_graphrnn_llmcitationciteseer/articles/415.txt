Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often neglect the contextual relationships between query terms. This paper presents a novel QE approach, CAQE, which leverages context-aware embeddings to capture nuanced semantic dependencies. By incorporating a graph-based attention mechanism, CAQE can selectively emphasize relevant context and mitigate the impact of noisy terms. Our experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, with CAQE outperforming state-of-the-art QE methods by up to 15% in terms of MAP.
