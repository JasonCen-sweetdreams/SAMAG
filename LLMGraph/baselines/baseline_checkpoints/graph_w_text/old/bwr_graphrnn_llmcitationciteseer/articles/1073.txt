This paper presents a novel hierarchical task network planning (HTN) framework for coordinating autonomous vehicles in complex urban scenarios. We introduce a decentralized HTN planning algorithm that enables vehicles to dynamically allocate tasks, share resources, and adapt to changes in the environment. Our approach leverages a multi-agent system architecture, where each vehicle is modeled as an autonomous agent that communicates with its neighbors to achieve global optimality. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves vehicle coordination, reduces travel time, and increases safety in simulated urban environments.
