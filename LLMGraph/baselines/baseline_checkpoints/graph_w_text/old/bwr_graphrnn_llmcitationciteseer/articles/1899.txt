Distributed database systems face significant challenges in optimizing query performance, particularly in the presence of complex joins and subqueries. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query optimization, which leverages graph neural networks to model query dependencies and optimize join ordering. Our approach, 'GraphOpt', outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while also reducing the number of intermediate results by up to 40%. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its scalability and effectiveness in handling large-scale distributed queries.
