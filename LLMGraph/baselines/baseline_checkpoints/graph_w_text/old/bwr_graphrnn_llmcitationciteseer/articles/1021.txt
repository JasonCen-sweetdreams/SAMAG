Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial in various applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. HAN combines local and global attention mechanisms to identify anomalies at multiple scales. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets and provides feature importance scores, enabling explainability of anomaly detection results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in a real-world industrial equipment monitoring scenario.
