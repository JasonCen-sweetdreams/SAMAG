In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to allocate tasks to heterogeneous agents. Our approach exploits the structure of the problem to decompose the global optimization problem into local sub-problems, which are then solved using a DCOP algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive simulations on a variety of scenarios, showcasing improved task allocation efficiency and scalability compared to centralized approaches.
