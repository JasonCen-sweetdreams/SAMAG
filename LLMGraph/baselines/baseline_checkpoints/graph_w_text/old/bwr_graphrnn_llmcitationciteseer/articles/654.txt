Distributed database systems face significant challenges in query optimization, which can lead to suboptimal performance and increased latency. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database environment. The DQN agent learns to balance the trade-off between query execution time and resource utilization, achieving significant performance improvements over traditional rule-based optimizers. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving an average query execution time reduction of 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
