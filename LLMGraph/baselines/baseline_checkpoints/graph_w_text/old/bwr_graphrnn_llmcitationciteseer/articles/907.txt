In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent-agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach, called 'GNN-TA', enables each agent to learn a policy for task selection and allocation based on local observations and graph-based features. We evaluate GNN-TA on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized and distributed allocation methods.
