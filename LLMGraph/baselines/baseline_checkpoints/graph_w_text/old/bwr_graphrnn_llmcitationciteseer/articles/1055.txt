In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph attention networks (GATs) to model complex agent interactions. By learning attention weights over agent-agent and agent-task graphs, our approach enables agents to adaptively allocate tasks based on their capabilities, availability, and communication constraints. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to traditional centralized approaches.
