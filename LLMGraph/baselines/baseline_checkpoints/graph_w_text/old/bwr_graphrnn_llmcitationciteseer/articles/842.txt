Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We propose a framework, 'RL-QOpt', which leverages a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query execution strategy based on historical query patterns and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional rule-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
