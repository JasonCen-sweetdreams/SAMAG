Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the relevance and diversity of search results. This paper proposes a novel approach to real-time query expansion using neural language models. We fine-tune a pre-trained language model on a large corpus of text data and use it to generate expanded queries that capture the nuances of user intent. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, yielding improvements in precision, recall, and mean average precision. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in real-time settings, achieving response times of under 100ms.
