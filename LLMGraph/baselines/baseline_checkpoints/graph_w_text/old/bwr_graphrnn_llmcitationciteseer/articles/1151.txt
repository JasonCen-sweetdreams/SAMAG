Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture complex temporal dependencies and identify relevant feature subsets contributing to anomalous patterns. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while providing transparent and interpretable insights into the decision-making process.
