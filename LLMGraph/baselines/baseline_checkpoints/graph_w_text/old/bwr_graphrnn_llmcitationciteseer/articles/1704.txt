Object detection is a critical task in autonomous vehicles, but existing methods are often computationally expensive and energy-inefficient. This paper introduces 'NAS-OD', a neural architecture search (NAS) framework tailored for efficient object detection. By leveraging reinforcement learning and a novel search space, NAS-OD discovers compact and accurate object detectors that can be deployed on resource-constrained autonomous vehicles. We evaluate NAS-OD on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in detection accuracy and inference speed compared to state-of-the-art detectors.
