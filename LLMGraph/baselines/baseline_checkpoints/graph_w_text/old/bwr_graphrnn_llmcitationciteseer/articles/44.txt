Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and behavior in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar group. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported enjoyment. We also identify key factors influencing avatar personalization, including facial similarity and body shape. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems and applications, particularly in areas such as gaming, education, and therapy.
