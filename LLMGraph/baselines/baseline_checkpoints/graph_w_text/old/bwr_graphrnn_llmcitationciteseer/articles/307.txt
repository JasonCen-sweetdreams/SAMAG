Attributed networks, where nodes possess rich feature information, are ubiquitous in various domains such as social media, biology, and finance. Anomaly detection in these networks is a crucial task, but existing approaches often neglect the complex relationships between nodes and their attributes. This paper proposes a novel deep graph neural network (DGNN) architecture, 'Attributed-GAT', that jointly leverages graph structure and node attributes to identify anomalies. Our approach incorporates a self-attention mechanism to selectively aggregate features from neighboring nodes and a reconstruction-based anomaly scoring function. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of Attributed-GAT over state-of-the-art methods in detecting anomalies in attributed networks.
