Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks, including node classification. However, existing GNNs often struggle to capture complex relationships between nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, 'HAGNN', which leverages multi-level attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and their relationships. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN on several benchmark datasets, showcasing improved classification accuracy and robustness to graph perturbations.
