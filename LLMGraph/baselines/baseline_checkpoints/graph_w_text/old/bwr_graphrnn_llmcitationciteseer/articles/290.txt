In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages stochastic graph neural networks (SGNNs) to model complex agent interactions. Our approach enables agents to learn probabilistic representations of task assignments and adapt to dynamic environmental changes. We evaluate our framework on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches. The proposed method is scalable, flexible, and can be applied to various multi-agent domains.
