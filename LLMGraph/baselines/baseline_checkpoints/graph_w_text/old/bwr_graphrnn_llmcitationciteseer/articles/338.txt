Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly employed in real-world applications, but the lack of transparency in their decision-making processes hinders trust and accountability. This paper introduces Hierarchical Attention Networks (HANs) to facilitate explainable decision-making in MAS. HANs leverage attention mechanisms to model inter-agent relationships and hierarchical dependencies, enabling the identification of influential agents and their contributions to collective decisions. We evaluate HANs on a variety of MAS benchmarks and demonstrate improved performance and interpretability compared to existing approaches.
