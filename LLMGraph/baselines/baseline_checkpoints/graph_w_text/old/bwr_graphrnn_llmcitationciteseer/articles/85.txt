Optimizing query execution plans is crucial for distributed databases, but traditional methods are often slow and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to accelerate query optimization. We design a neural network that learns to predict optimal join orders and indexing strategies from a large corpus of queries. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database show that our method, 'DeepQP', achieves up to 3x speedup in query execution time compared to state-of-the-art optimizers, while maintaining near-optimal plan quality.
