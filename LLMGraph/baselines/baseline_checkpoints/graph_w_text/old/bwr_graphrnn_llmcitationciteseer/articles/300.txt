Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, particularly when dealing with short-text documents. This paper proposes a novel neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuroExpan', to expand queries for effective retrieval. We leverage a hierarchical attention mechanism to learn contextualized representations of query terms and document keywords. Experimental results on the TREC Microblog dataset demonstrate that NeuroExpan outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
