Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it enables search engines to retrieve relevant documents that may not contain the exact search query. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. We train a transformer-based model to learn semantic relationships between words and generate expanded queries that capture the nuances of the original query. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion techniques, with an average increase of 15% in mean average precision.
