Few-shot node classification is a challenging task in graph learning, as it requires generalization to novel classes with limited labeled data. We propose a Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs. HGAT consists of a node-level attention module that captures local dependencies, and a graph-level attention module that aggregates information across subgraphs. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 5.2% on 5-shot node classification tasks.
