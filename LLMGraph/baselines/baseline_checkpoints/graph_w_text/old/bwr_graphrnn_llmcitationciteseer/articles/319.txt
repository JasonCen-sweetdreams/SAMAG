Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a neural embedding-based query expansion approach, NEQE, which leverages semantic relationships between terms to improve retrieval effectiveness. NEQE utilizes a multi-layer perceptron to learn dense vector representations of query terms, which are then used to generate a set of related expansion terms. Our experiments on several TREC benchmarks demonstrate that NEQE significantly outperforms traditional expansion techniques, such as Rocchio and RM3, in terms of mean average precision and recall.
