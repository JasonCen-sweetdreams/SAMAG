The increasing complexity of IoT networks necessitates efficient resource allocation strategies to ensure reliable and scalable device interactions. This paper proposes a novel decentralized agent-based approach, 'DARA', which leverages autonomous agents to negotiate and allocate resources in a distributed manner. DARA incorporates a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to adapt to dynamic network conditions, optimizing resource utilization and minimizing latency. Experimental results on a simulated IoT testbed demonstrate that DARA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of network throughput and device satisfaction.
