AI-powered chatbots have become increasingly prevalent in customer service, but their accessibility for people with disabilities remains a significant concern. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive chatbots that accommodate users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We employ a participatory design approach, involving users with disabilities in the co-design process. Our results show that the proposed framework improves user satisfaction, task completion rates, and overall accessibility compared to traditional chatbot designs. We also provide guidelines for developers to create more accessible and usable chatbot interfaces.
