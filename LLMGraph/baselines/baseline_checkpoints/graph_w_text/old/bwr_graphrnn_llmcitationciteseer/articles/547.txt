In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages adaptive coalition formation to optimize task assignments. Our approach integrates a dynamic clustering algorithm with a decentralized negotiation protocol, enabling agents to form and reconfigure coalitions in response to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system adaptability.
