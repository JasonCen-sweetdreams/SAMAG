Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern data centers, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging task. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to query optimization, proposing a novel framework that learns to optimize query plans based on runtime feedback. Our approach, called 'RL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to select the most efficient query plan from a set of candidate plans, taking into account various factors such as data distribution, network latency, and query complexity. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-QO achieves significant performance improvements compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
