Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in node classification tasks, but their inductive capabilities are limited by their reliance on transductive learning. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global graph structures to improve inductive node classification. Our model recursively applies graph attention mechanisms at multiple scales, allowing it to capture complex node relationships and adapt to new graph structures. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art GNN models in inductive node classification scenarios.
