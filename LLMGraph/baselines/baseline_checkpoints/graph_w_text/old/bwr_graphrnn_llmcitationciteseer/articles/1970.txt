High-dimensional data clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning, but existing approaches often suffer from scalability issues or are sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. This paper presents a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm, TreeNClust, which leverages the strengths of tree-based neural networks to efficiently process high-dimensional data. TreeNClust learns a hierarchical representation of the data using a combination of self-organizing maps and neural decision trees, enabling it to adapt to varying densities and cluster shapes. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that TreeNClust outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency.
