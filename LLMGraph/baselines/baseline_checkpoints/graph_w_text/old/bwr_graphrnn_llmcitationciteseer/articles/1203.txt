Emotion recognition from multimodal inputs, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of human emotions. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features for emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers, followed by a hierarchical fusion layer that integrates the attended features. Experiments on the CMU-MOSEI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal fusion methods, achieving an improvement of 12.5% in emotion recognition accuracy.
