Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial for many applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights. Our HAN model consists of two levels of attention: a temporal attention module that weighs the importance of different time steps, and a feature attention module that highlights relevant features contributing to the anomaly score. We evaluate our approach on three real-world datasets and demonstrate improved detection performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
