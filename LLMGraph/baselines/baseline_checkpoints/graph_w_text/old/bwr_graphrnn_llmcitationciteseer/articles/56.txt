Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in many applications, but most existing methods lack interpretability. This paper introduces Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN), a novel deep learning framework that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights into the detection process. HAN leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant temporal segments and features, generating attention weights that indicate the contribution of each segment to the anomaly score. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for the detected anomalies.
