As human-robot collaboration (HRC) becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying human-robot interaction. This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in HRC, focusing on how humans' bodily experiences influence their perception and interaction with robots. We conducted a user study using a robotic arm to investigate how participants' motor control and spatial reasoning abilities affect their ability to collaborate with the robot. Our results show that embodied cognition plays a significant role in HRC, and we propose a novel framework for designing robots that can adapt to individual differences in human cognition.
