Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach to query expansion, which leverages dense embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our proposed method, GraphExpan, constructs a heterogeneous graph incorporating both local and global context, and applies a variant of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to learn informative node representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphExpan outperforms existing query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
