Entity retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant entities from a large corpus in response to a user query. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion framework that leverages graph embeddings to model entity relationships. Our approach, called GraphExpan, uses a graph attention mechanism to select relevant expansion terms and integrates them into a probabilistic retrieval model. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphExpan significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
