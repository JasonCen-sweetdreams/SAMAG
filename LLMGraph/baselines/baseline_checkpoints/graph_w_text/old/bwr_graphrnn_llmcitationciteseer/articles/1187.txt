Time series forecasting has numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and energy management. However, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying factors driving the predictions. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to select relevant features and time steps. Our approach enables explainable forecasting by providing feature importance scores and attention weights. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HAN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of forecasting accuracy and interpretability.
