Ad-hoc retrieval relies on effective query representation to retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms. Our approach, 'NeuroXpand', uses a transformer-based architecture to learn dense representations of query terms and their contextualized senses. We demonstrate that NeuroXpand outperforms traditional query expansion techniques on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain. Our results suggest that neural embeddings can be effectively used to enhance the retrieval performance of ad-hoc search systems.
