As databases continue to grow in size and complexity, optimizing query performance becomes increasingly critical. This paper proposes a novel approach to index selection using deep learning techniques, specifically designed for distributed database systems. Our method, dubbed 'DeepIndex', leverages a graph neural network to learn the relationships between query patterns, data distributions, and indexing strategies. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database demonstrate that DeepIndex achieves a 30% reduction in query latency and a 25% improvement in throughput compared to traditional index selection methods.
