Explainable recommendation systems aim to provide transparency into the decision-making process, improving user trust and satisfaction. We propose Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that incorporates graph attention mechanisms to model complex user-item relationships. HGAT learns to generate explainable recommendations by identifying relevant item features and user preferences at multiple hierarchical levels. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
