Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate query optimization as a Markov decision process and develop a deep Q-network-based algorithm to learn the optimal query plan. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
