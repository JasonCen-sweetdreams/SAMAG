Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities must cooperate to achieve common goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing environmental conditions and agent heterogeneity. Our approach uses a decentralized deep Q-network to learn optimal task assignment policies for each agent, without requiring explicit communication or centralized control. Experiments on a variety of simulated scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing overall system cost.
