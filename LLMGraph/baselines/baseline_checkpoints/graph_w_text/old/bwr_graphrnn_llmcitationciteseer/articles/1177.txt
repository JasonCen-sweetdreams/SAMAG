Object detection in autonomous vehicles requires real-time processing on resource-constrained hardware. This paper proposes a Bayesian neural network pruning (BNNP) method for efficient object detection models. Our approach leverages Bayesian inference to estimate the importance of neural connections and prune redundant weights, achieving a significant reduction in computational cost. We evaluate our method on the KITTI dataset and demonstrate improved real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art object detection models while maintaining accuracy. The proposed BNNP method can be integrated into existing deep learning frameworks, enabling real-time object detection in autonomous vehicles.
