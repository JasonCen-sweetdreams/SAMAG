Neural ranking models have revolutionized search engines by improving the accuracy of search results. However, their computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. This paper presents 'NeuroIndex', a novel indexing technique that accelerates neural ranking models by up to 5x. NeuroIndex leverages a hierarchical index structure and a probabilistic pruning strategy to reduce the number of neural network evaluations. Our experiments on a large-scale search engine dataset demonstrate that NeuroIndex maintains the accuracy of the neural ranking model while meeting the latency requirements of real-time search engines.
