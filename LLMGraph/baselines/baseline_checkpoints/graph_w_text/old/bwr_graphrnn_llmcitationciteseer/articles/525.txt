In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents in a way that maximizes overall efficiency. This paper proposes a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). Our method, called DTA-DCOP, allows agents to communicate with each other to resolve conflicts and find a feasible assignment of tasks. We prove that DTA-DCOP is complete and sound, and evaluate its performance on a variety of benchmark problems. Experimental results show that DTA-DCOP outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of solution quality and runtime.
