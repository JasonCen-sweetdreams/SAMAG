Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task in affective computing. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that selectively focuses on relevant modalities and features to improve recognition accuracy. Our HAN model consists of three levels of attention: modality-level, feature-level, and instance-level, which enables it to capture complex interactions between modalities and features. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
