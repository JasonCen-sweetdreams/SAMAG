Main-memory databases have revolutionized query performance, but indexing techniques remain a bottleneck. This paper introduces 'Adaptix', an adaptive learned indexing framework that leverages machine learning to optimize query processing in main-memory databases. By dynamically adjusting index structures based on query patterns and data distributions, Adaptix achieves significant performance gains over traditional indexing methods. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate up to 3x improvement in query throughput and 2x reduction in memory usage compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
