Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and learning outcomes in VR-based learning environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR-based educational platform using either a generic or personalized avatar. Results show that users with personalized avatars exhibit increased engagement, improved knowledge retention, and enhanced overall satisfaction. We also identify key factors influencing avatar personalization, including facial similarity and customization options.
