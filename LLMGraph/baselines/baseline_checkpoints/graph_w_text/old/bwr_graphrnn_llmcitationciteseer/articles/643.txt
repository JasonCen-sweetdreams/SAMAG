The increasing adoption of main-memory column-store databases for real-time analytics poses significant indexing challenges. Existing indexing techniques are often optimized for disk-based storage, leading to suboptimal performance in memory-resident environments. This paper introduces 'MMCI', a novel indexing framework tailored to main-memory column-stores. MMCI leverages a combination of bit-packed arrays, SIMD instructions, and adaptive sampling to minimize indexing overhead. Our experimental evaluation on a range of real-world datasets demonstrates that MMCI outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query performance and memory efficiency.
