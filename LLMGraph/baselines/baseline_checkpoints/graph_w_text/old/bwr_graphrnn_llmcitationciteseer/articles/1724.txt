Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale data. However, optimizing queries in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and node communication. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design a RL framework that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment, taking into account factors such as data locality, node workload, and communication costs. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
