Emotion recognition from multimodal inputs (e.g., facial expressions, speech, and text) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and temporal segments. Our HAN model consists of three stages: modality attention, temporal attention, and fusion. We evaluate our approach on the CMU-MOSEI dataset and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art multimodal emotion recognition methods, achieving an average accuracy of 83.2%.
