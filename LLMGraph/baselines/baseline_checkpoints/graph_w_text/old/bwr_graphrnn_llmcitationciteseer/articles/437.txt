Graph databases have become increasingly popular for managing complex relationships between entities. However, optimizing queries on large-scale graph data remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages machine learning-based indexing and pruning techniques to reduce query latency and improve throughput. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphOpt on several real-world graph datasets, achieving an average speedup of 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art query optimization methods.
