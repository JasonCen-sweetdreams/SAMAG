Coordinating multiple agents in complex systems is a challenging problem due to the exponential growth of possible interactions. This paper proposes a novel approach using Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT) to learn effective coordination strategies. HGAT combines graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical representations to capture both local and global dependencies between agents. We evaluate our approach on a range of benchmarks, including traffic management and robotic swarm control, and demonstrate significant improvements in system performance and scalability compared to existing methods.
