Entity matching, a crucial step in data integration, becomes increasingly challenging when dealing with heterogeneous data sources. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepEM', which leverages the strengths of both supervised and unsupervised learning. DeepEM utilizes a neural network architecture to learn robust representations of entities, enabling accurate matching across diverse data sources. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of DeepEM, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall.
