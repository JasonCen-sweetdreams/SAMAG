Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches struggle with scalability and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel method that leverages knowledge graph embeddings and parallel query optimization to efficiently disambiguate entities. We introduce a distributed query execution framework that exploits the sparsity of the knowledge graph and reduces the number of required similarity computations. Experimental results on large-scale datasets demonstrate a significant reduction in disambiguation time while maintaining high accuracy.
