Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that integrates attention mechanisms at multiple levels to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features. We introduce a novel emotion-specific attention module that adaptively weighs the importance of each modality based on the target emotion. Experimental results on the CMU-MOSI dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and provides interpretable explanations for the predicted emotions.
