Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to learn new concepts from limited labeled data. Recent advances in FSL have focused on meta-learning and metric-based approaches. However, these methods often struggle with limited labeled data and ignore the hierarchical relationships between classes. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for FSL, which leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant class hierarchies and limited labeled data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several FSL benchmarks, including mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet, and demonstrates improved robustness to limited labeled data.
