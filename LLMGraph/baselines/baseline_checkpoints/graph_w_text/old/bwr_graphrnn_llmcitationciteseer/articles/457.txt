Time-series data is ubiquitous across various domains, but their complex and high-dimensional nature makes it challenging to extract meaningful representations. This paper introduces 'ChronoClust', an unsupervised representation learning framework that leverages contrastive clustering to learn robust and discriminative features from time-series data. By jointly optimizing clustering assignments and contrastive losses, ChronoClust captures both local and global patterns in the data, outperforming existing methods in downstream tasks such as classification and forecasting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoClust on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results.
