Time series forecasting is a fundamental task in many applications, but the lack of interpretability in modern deep learning models hinders their adoption in high-stakes domains. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant time series segments and features. Our approach enables the extraction of meaningful explanations for forecasting decisions, improving model trustworthiness. We evaluate HAN on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance and superior interpretability compared to state-of-the-art models.
