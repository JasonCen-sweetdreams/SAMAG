This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention mechanism for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce a two-level attention framework that focuses on relevant agents and interactions, enabling more efficient exploration and better policy coordination. Our approach, 'HAT-MARL', is evaluated on several multi-agent benchmarks, including traffic control and robotic soccer, demonstrating significant improvements in learning speed and overall performance compared to state-of-the-art MARL algorithms. We also provide theoretical insights into the benefits of hierarchical attention in MARL settings.
