Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often pose significant usability challenges for this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive VR interfaces that accommodate the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with caregivers and older adults to identify key interface requirements. Our proposed design framework incorporates features such as simplified navigation, high-contrast visuals, and multimodal feedback. A usability study with 20 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing VR interfaces.
