This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion for ad-hoc retrieval using deep neural networks. Our method, dubbed 'QENet', leverages the semantic capabilities of transformer-based architectures to learn context-aware term representations. By incorporating a relevance feedback mechanism, QENet can adapt to the query context and generate expanded queries that significantly improve retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of QENet in achieving state-of-the-art retrieval performance, outperforming traditional query expansion techniques.
