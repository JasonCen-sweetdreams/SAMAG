Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to scale and handle large volumes of data. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, called QOpt-RL, learns to predict the optimal query plan by interacting with the DDS and receiving feedback in the form of query execution times. We demonstrate the effectiveness of QOpt-RL in reducing query latency and improving system throughput compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world DDS dataset show that QOpt-RL achieves an average query latency reduction of 30% while improving system throughput by 25%.
