Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a customized reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize query plans based on query patterns, database statistics, and system workload. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and system throughput.
