In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel cooperative task allocation framework, 'HetAlloc', which takes into account the heterogeneous capabilities of agents. HetAlloc integrates a graph-based task representation with a distributed constraint optimization algorithm, enabling agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a decentralized manner. We evaluate HetAlloc on a set of simulated search-and-rescue scenarios, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing methods.
