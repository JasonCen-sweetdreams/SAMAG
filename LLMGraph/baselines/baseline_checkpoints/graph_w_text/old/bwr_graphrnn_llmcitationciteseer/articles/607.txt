Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have the potential to revolutionize urban transportation, but efficient route planning remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'RouteOpt', that learns to optimize routes for AVs in urban environments. We employ a multi-agent setting, where each AV learns to navigate through the city while minimizing travel time, fuel consumption, and traffic congestion. Our approach incorporates real-world traffic patterns, road topology, and pedestrian dynamics to generate optimized routes. Experimental results using large-scale simulation datasets demonstrate that RouteOpt outperforms state-of-the-art routing algorithms by up to 25% in terms of travel time and 17% in terms of fuel efficiency.
