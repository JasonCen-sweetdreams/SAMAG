In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a distributed task allocation policy. Our method, called GraphTask, represents the agent communication graph as a neural network and learns to predict task assignments based on the graph structure and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that GraphTask outperforms existing decentralized methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
