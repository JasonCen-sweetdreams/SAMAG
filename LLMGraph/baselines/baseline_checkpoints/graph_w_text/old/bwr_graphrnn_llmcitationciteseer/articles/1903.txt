Explainable recommendation systems are crucial for building trust with users. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that integrates user-item interactions, item relationships, and auxiliary features to generate personalized explanations. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant items and features, allowing for interpretable recommendations. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
