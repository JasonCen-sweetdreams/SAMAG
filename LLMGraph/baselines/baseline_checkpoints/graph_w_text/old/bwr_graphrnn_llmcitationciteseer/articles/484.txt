This paper addresses the problem of distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems, where a set of agents with varying capabilities need to accomplish a collection of tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn a decentralized task allocation policy. Our method, called Distributed Task Allocation with Deep Q-Networks (DTADQN), uses a multi-agent Q-learning framework to learn the optimal task allocation strategy. Experimental results on a simulated robotic domain demonstrate that DTADQN outperforms traditional graph-based methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
