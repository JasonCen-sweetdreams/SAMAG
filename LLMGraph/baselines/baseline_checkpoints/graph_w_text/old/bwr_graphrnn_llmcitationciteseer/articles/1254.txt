Decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in dynamic and uncertain environments. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn effective task allocation strategies. Our method, called 'Dec-TARL', uses a decentralized actor-critic framework to learn a policy that adapts to changing environmental conditions and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that Dec-TARL outperforms traditional centralized and distributed task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
