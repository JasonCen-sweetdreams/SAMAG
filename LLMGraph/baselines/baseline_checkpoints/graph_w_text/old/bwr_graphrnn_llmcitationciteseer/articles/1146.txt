Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern data centers, yet query optimization remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system performance metrics. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
