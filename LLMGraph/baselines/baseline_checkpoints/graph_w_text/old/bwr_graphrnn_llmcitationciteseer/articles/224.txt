Real-time information retrieval (IR) systems require efficient document filtering to reduce the latency and computational overhead. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'NeuFilter', that leverages the strengths of both traditional keyword-based filtering and neural ranking models. NeuFilter uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively filter out irrelevant documents, reducing the number of documents that need to be ranked by the neural model. Experimental results on the TREC News Track dataset demonstrate that NeuFilter achieves significant improvements in filtering efficiency and ranking effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
