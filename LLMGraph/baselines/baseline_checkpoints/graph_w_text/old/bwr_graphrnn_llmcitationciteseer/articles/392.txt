Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, achieving optimal query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an adaptive partitioning approach, called 'APart', which dynamically adjusts the data distribution across nodes based on query workload patterns. APart leverages a novel cost-benefit analysis to identify optimal partitioning schemes, minimizing query latency and maximizing resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that APart outperforms state-of-the-art partitioning techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
