Query optimization is a crucial component in distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which may not always yield optimal results. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-QOpt', that leverages reinforcement learning to learn optimal query plans. We design a Markov decision process to model the query optimization problem and employ a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
