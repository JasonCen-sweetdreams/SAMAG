Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but existing interfaces often neglect the role of embodied cognition in shaping user experience. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interaction framework that leverages the cognitive benefits of embodied cognition in VR. We conduct a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, which incorporates machine learning-based gesture recognition and haptic feedback. Results show significant improvements in user engagement, task performance, and overall satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. Our findings have implications for the design of immersive and interactive systems in various domains, including education, gaming, and healthcare.
