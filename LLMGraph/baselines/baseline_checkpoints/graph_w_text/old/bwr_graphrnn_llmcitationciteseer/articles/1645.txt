Deep semantic search has emerged as a promising approach for retrieving relevant documents in information retrieval systems. However, the effectiveness of such systems heavily relies on the quality of query expansion techniques. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based approach, 'RL-QE', which learns to generate optimal query expansions by interacting with the search environment. We develop a customized reward function that balances relevance, novelty, and diversity of the expanded queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 23% in terms of mean average precision.
