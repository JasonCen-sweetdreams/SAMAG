Human pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with numerous applications in robotics, healthcare, and surveillance. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) architecture for real-time human pose estimation. Our approach leverages a hierarchical representation of the human body, where each node in the graph corresponds to a body part. We propose a novel message passing scheme that enables efficient feature exchange between nodes, resulting in improved pose estimation accuracy. Experimental results on the MPII Human Pose dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and inference speed.
