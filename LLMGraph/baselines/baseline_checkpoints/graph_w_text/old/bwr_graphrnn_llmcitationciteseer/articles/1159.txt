Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but its immersive nature can lead to user discomfort and disorientation. This study investigates the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience in VR. We designed a novel haptic feedback system that simulates real-world tactile sensations and conducted a user study to evaluate its impact on user satisfaction, engagement, and motion sickness. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user experience, reduces motion sickness, and increases overall satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for VR system design and future research directions.
