Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges when interacting with digital systems. This paper presents a novel approach to gesture recognition that adapts to the unique abilities and limitations of each user. Our system, 'Adapta Gesture', leverages machine learning to identify patterns in user behavior and dynamically adjusts the recognition model to accommodate variations in movement speed, accuracy, and range. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments and demonstrated significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches.
