Column stores have become popular for real-time analytics due to their fast query performance and efficient storage. However, optimizing complex queries on column stores remains a challenging problem. This paper presents 'OPTIC', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and graph-based methods to identify optimal query plans. OPTIC achieves up to 5x speedup over state-of-the-art optimizers by adaptively selecting the most efficient join orders, compression schemes, and filter applications. We evaluate OPTIC on a diverse set of real-world workloads and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing query latency and improving system throughput.
