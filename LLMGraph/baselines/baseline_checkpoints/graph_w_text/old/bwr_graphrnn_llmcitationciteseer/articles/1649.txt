Explainable recommendation systems are crucial for building trust with users. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that incorporates item and user relationships to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. Our HGAT model employs a hierarchical graph structure to capture both local and global dependencies among items and users, and attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality, providing users with more transparent and interpretable recommendations.
