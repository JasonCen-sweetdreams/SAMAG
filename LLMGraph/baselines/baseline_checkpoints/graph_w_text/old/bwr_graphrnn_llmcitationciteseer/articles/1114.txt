Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the lives of individuals with visual impairments, but existing VR systems often fail to provide accessible experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces that accommodate users with visual impairments. We propose a set of guidelines and tools for creating audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized assistance. Our user study with 20 participants demonstrates that our approach significantly improves the overall VR experience, task completion time, and user satisfaction for users with visual impairments.
