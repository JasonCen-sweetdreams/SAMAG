Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data, but efficient query processing remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'DIANA', designed to accelerate multi-dimensional range queries in distributed database systems. DIANA leverages a hierarchical indexing structure that adaptively partitions the data space, enabling efficient pruning of irrelevant data regions. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that DIANA outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time and 2x in terms of storage overhead.
