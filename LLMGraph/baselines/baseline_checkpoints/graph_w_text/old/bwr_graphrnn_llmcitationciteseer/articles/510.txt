This paper presents a novel multi-agent coordination framework for real-time traffic management, enabling efficient and scalable decision-making in complex urban environments. Our approach leverages distributed constraint optimization and machine learning to allocate traffic signals and optimize traffic flow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through simulations on a large-scale traffic network, showing significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional traffic signal control methods.
