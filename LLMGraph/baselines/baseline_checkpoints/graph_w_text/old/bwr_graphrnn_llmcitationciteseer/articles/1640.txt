Distributed database systems are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query execution plans remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans based on runtime feedback. Our method, called 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that minimizes query latency and resource utilization. We evaluate RL-Opt on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource efficiency compared to traditional optimization techniques.
