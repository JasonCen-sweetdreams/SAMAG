This paper presents a novel approach to designing voice-based interfaces that are more accessible and usable for individuals with speech impairments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with dysarthria and developed a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice interfaces. Our approach incorporates machine learning-based speech recognition models that are optimized for robustness to speech variability, as well as adaptive feedback mechanisms to support user communication. Results show that our approach significantly improves the accuracy and user experience of voice-based interfaces for individuals with speech impairments, highlighting the potential for more inclusive and accessible interaction design.
