Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize the way people interact with digital information, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR systems that can be navigated by users with visual impairments. We propose a multimodal interaction approach that combines audio and haptic feedback to enable users to explore and interact with virtual environments. Our user study with 20 participants demonstrates that our approach improves navigation efficiency and user satisfaction compared to existing VR systems.
