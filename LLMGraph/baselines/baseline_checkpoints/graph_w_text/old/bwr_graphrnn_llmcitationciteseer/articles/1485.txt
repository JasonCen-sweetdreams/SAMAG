With the proliferation of cloud-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms, efficient query optimization has become crucial for multi-tenant environments. This paper presents a novel approach, 'QOpt', which leverages a combination of statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to optimize query execution plans. QOpt predicts query performance based on historical workload patterns and resource utilization, and dynamically adjusts query plans to minimize latency and improve resource allocation. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate that QOpt achieves an average query latency reduction of 35% and a 25% improvement in resource utilization compared to traditional query optimizers.
