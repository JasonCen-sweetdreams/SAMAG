Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual impairments. We propose a set of guidelines and tools for developers to create VR environments that are perceivable, operable, and understandable by users with visual impairments. Our user study with 20 participants demonstrates that our approach significantly improves the overall VR experience and task completion rates for users with visual impairments.
