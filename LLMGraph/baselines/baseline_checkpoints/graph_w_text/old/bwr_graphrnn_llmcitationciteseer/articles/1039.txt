This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, called DTRL, enables agents to learn optimal task assignments in a distributed manner, without relying on a centralized controller. We use a multi-agent deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a variety of task allocation scenarios. Experimental results show that DTRL outperforms existing decentralized methods and achieves near-optimal performance in many cases, making it a promising approach for real-world multi-agent systems.
