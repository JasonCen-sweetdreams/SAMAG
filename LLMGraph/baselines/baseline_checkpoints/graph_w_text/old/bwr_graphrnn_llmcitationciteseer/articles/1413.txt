Main-memory databases have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper explores the application of learned index structures to optimize query workloads in main-memory databases. We propose a novel indexing framework, 'LIX', which leverages machine learning models to predict query access patterns and adaptively reorganize index structures to minimize query latency. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that LIX achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance compared to traditional indexing techniques, while maintaining a low memory footprint.
