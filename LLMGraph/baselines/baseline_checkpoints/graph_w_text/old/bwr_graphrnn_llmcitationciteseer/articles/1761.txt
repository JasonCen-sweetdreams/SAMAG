The increasing volume of online information necessitates efficient document filtering techniques for effective information retrieval. This paper presents a novel query-agnostic document filtering approach, 'DocFilter', which leverages a learned document representation to filter out irrelevant documents at query-time. Our method exploits a hierarchical attention mechanism to encode documents and a clustering-based indexing scheme to facilitate fast filtering. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DocFilter achieves significant improvements in filtering efficiency while maintaining retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
