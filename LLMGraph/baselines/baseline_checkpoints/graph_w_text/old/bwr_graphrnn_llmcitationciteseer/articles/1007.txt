Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants were randomly assigned to interact with either a generic or personalized avatar in a VR game. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, satisfaction, and self-presence compared to those interacting with generic avatars. We also found that users' sense of agency and embodiment were positively correlated with the level of personalization. The findings have implications for the design of VR systems and highlight the importance of considering individual differences in user modeling.
