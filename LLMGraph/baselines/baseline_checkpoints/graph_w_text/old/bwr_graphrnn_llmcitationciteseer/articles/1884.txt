Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed graph databases. We design a Markov decision process that models the query optimization problem and train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
