Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in older adults' daily lives, but error recovery mechanisms often exacerbate user frustration. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing personalized error recovery strategies for older adults, focusing on voice assistants. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, combining surveys, think-aloud protocols, and Wizard-of-Oz experiments. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive feedback, explicit error acknowledgment, and personalized recovery options. We propose a novel framework, 'VoiceCare', which integrates these insights to improve the user experience of voice assistants for older adults.
