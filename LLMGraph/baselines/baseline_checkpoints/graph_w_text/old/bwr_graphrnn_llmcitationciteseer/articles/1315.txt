Virtual reality (VR) technologies have the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with visual impairments face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents a novel VR interface design paradigm that leverages haptic feedback, 3D audio cues, and personalized assistive agents to enhance accessibility for visually impaired users. We conduct a user study with 20 participants to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating improved navigation, interaction, and overall user experience. Our findings inform the development of inclusive VR systems that can benefit a broader population.
