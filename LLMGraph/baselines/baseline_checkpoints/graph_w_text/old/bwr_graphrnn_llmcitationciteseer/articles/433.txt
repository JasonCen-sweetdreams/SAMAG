Recommendation systems (RS) are pervasive in modern online platforms, but their opacity hinders user trust. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that incorporates both user-item and item-item relationships to generate explainable recommendations. By employing attention mechanisms at multiple graph hierarchies, HGAT learns to identify relevant feature patterns and highlight influential items in the recommendation process. We evaluate HGAT on three real-world datasets, demonstrating improved recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
