Open-domain question answering (ODQA) models rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents for answering a question. This paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Sparse Retrieval (HSR), which leverages sparse representations to prune the search space and reduce computational overhead. We propose a hierarchical framework that iteratively applies sparse transformations to the document embeddings, allowing for fast and accurate passage retrieval. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HSR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing the retrieval time by 3.5x compared to existing methods.
