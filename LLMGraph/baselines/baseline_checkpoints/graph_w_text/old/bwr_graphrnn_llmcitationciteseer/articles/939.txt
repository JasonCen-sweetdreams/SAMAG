This study investigates the design of accessible conversational interfaces for older adults, focusing on voice-controlled smart home systems. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 older adults, exploring their needs, preferences, and experiences with smart home systems. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise voice prompts, visual feedback, and personalized assistance. We propose a set of design guidelines for accessible conversational interfaces and develop a prototype system that incorporates these guidelines. Our evaluation results show significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates compared to existing systems.
