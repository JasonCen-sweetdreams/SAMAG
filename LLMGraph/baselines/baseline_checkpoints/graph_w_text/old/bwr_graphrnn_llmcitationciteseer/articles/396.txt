Passage retrieval is a critical component in many information retrieval systems, but its computational cost can be prohibitively high. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation, 'HiDR', which captures the semantic relationships between passages within a document. By modeling passage relationships as a hierarchical graph, HiDR enables efficient passage retrieval through a top-down traversal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HiDR on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods.
