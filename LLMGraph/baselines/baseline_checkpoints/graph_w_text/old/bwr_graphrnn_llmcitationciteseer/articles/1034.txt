In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for maximizing overall performance. This paper introduces 'RL-TA', a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task allocation in distributed agent networks. RL-TA employs a decentralized, asynchronous learning approach, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on its local observations and interactions with neighboring agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-TA in simulated environments, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional, centralized allocation methods.
