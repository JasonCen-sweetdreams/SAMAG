The surge in digital information has made efficient document retrieval a crucial task. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted features and suffer from the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes Hierarchical Neural Embeddings (HNE), a novel document representation learning approach that leverages the hierarchical structure of documents. HNE embeds documents at multiple granularities, from sentences to sections, using a stacked neural network architecture. Experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HNE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while also providing interpretable document representations.
