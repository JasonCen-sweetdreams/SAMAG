In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn task allocation policies. Our method, called GraphTask, represents agents and tasks as nodes in a graph and learns to predict task assignments based on agent capabilities and task requirements. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that GraphTask outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in terms of allocation efficiency and robustness to agent failures.
