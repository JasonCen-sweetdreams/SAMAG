Query expansion is a crucial technique in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel neural semantic embedding-based approach, 'NSE-QE', which learns to represent queries and documents in a shared vector space. We introduce a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion, document ranking, and semantic matching. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that NSE-QE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
