Older adults with cognitive impairments face significant barriers when interacting with modern computing systems. This paper presents a gestural interface designed to improve accessibility for this population. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 older adults and 5 caregivers to identify key design principles and guidelines. Our interface, 'EasyGest', incorporates simplified gestures, visual feedback, and speech output to reduce cognitive load and improve user experience. A usability evaluation with 10 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional mouse-based interfaces.
