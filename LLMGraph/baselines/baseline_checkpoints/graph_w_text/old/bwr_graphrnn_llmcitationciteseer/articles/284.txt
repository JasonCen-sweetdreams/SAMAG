Traditional document ranking models often ignore the context in which queries are issued, leading to suboptimal retrieval results. This paper proposes a novel context-aware document ranking framework, 'HIRA', which leverages hierarchical attention networks to capture both local and global contextual dependencies between queries and documents. Our approach incorporates a multi-level attention mechanism that adaptively weighs the importance of different query terms, document fields, and contextual features. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HIRA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of precision, recall, and relevance.
