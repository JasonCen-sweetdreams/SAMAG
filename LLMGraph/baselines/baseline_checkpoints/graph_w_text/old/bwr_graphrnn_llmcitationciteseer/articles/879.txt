Edge computing networks require efficient resource allocation to ensure low-latency services. This paper proposes a decentralized agent-based framework, 'EdgeAgent', which leverages autonomous decision-making to allocate resources in real-time. Each agent represents a network node and communicates with its neighbors to optimize resource utilization. We introduce a novel negotiation protocol that enables agents to adapt to changing network conditions and user demands. Experimental results show that EdgeAgent outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of resource utilization, latency, and scalability.
