Scholarly search engines rely on effective document ranking algorithms to retrieve relevant research papers. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HierRank', which leverages hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the complex relationships between documents, authors, and citation networks. Our method learns a hierarchical representation of documents by aggregating features from citation graphs, author collaborations, and content-based embeddings. Experimental results on the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, such as BERT-based and graph-based methods, in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
