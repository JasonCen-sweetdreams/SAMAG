Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the quality of life for individuals with motor disabilities, but existing VR interfaces often exacerbate accessibility barriers. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces tailored to the needs of individuals with motor disabilities. We conducted user studies with participants having varying levels of motor impairment and developed a set of design guidelines for VR interfaces that prioritize ease of use, comfort, and adaptability. Our proposed framework incorporates machine learning-driven gesture recognition and personalized interface adaptation, achieving a significant improvement in user experience and task completion rates.
