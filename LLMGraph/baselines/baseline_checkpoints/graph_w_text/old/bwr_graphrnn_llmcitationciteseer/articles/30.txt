Time series forecasting is a crucial task in many applications, but most models lack interpretability. This paper introduces HATSF (Hierarchical Attention-based Time Series Forecaster), a novel deep learning framework that leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant temporal segments and features. HATSF incorporates a feature importance estimator, enabling the model to generate explanations for its predictions. We evaluate HATSF on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved forecasting accuracy and insightful explanations compared to state-of-the-art models.
