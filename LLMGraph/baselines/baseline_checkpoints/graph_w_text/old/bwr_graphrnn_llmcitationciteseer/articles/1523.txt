In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments for autonomous agents. Our approach, called 'DARLA', utilizes a decentralized Q-learning algorithm to learn optimal task allocation policies for each agent, considering factors such as agent capabilities, task priorities, and environmental constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that DARLA outperforms traditional centralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, resource utilization, and adaptability to changing environments.
