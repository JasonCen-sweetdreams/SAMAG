As data volumes continue to grow, distributed database systems face significant challenges in optimizing query execution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to predict optimal execution plans based on query patterns and system metrics. Our framework, 'RL-Optimizer', leverages a deep Q-network to select the most efficient plan from a vast space of possible alternatives. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization, while adapting to changing workloads and system configurations.
