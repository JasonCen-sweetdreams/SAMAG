 Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability is often hindered by complex interactions, leading to frustration and exclusion of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents an inclusive design framework for voice assistants, emphasizing simplicity, clarity, and adaptability. We conducted user studies with 30 older adults and identified key challenges in understanding voice commands, managing multiple-turn dialogues, and recovering from errors. Our prototype, 'EasyVoice', incorporates visual cues, semantic parsing, and personalized assistance to improve user experience. Results show a significant reduction in user errors and an increase in task completion rates, demonstrating the potential of inclusive design for voice assistants.
