Coordinated exploration is a critical component in multi-agent systems, enabling agents to efficiently explore complex environments while minimizing redundancy. This paper proposes a novel approach, Graph Attention-based Coordinated Exploration (GACE), which leverages graph attention networks to model inter-agent relationships and environment dynamics. GACE adaptively adjusts exploration strategies based on the attention weights, allowing agents to focus on under-explored regions and cooperate more effectively. Experimental results on various multi-agent environments demonstrate that GACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of exploration efficiency and task performance.
