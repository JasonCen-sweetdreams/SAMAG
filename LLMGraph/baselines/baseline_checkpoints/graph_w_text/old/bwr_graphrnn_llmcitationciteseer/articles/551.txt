In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation using reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized algorithm, 'MA-RL', that enables agents to learn from their experiences and allocate tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. Experimental results on a simulated environment show that MA-RL outperforms traditional rule-based allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization. We also demonstrate the scalability of our approach in large-scale systems.
