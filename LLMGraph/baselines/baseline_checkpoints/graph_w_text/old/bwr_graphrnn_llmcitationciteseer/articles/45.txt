Distributed column-stores have become increasingly popular for big data analytics, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query planning. Our approach, called 'RL-Opt', leverages a combination of query features and runtime statistics to adapt to changing workloads and system conditions. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
