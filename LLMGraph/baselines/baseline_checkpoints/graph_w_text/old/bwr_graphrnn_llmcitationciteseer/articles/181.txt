Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a simulated distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and system throughput compared to traditional optimization techniques.
