Distributed column stores have become a popular choice for big data analytics due to their ability to handle large-scale datasets and provide high query performance. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages machine learning techniques to predict the optimal query plan for a given workload. ColOpt uses a combination of feature extraction and clustering algorithms to identify patterns in the query workload and adapt to changing data distributions. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColOpt achieves an average query performance improvement of 30% compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
