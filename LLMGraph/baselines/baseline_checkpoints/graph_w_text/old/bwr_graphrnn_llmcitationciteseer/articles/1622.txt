Temporal graph databases are increasingly important for storing and querying complex, time-evolving relationships. However, existing indexing techniques are often inefficient or ineffective for large-scale temporal graphs. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, Hierarchical Bloom Filters for Temporal Graphs (HBF-TG), which leverages Bloom filters to reduce the number of disk accesses and accelerate query processing. Our experiments on real-world temporal graph datasets demonstrate that HBF-TG achieves up to 5x query performance improvement and 3x storage reduction compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods.
