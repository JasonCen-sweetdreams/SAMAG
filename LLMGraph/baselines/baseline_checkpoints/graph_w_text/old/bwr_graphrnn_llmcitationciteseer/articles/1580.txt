This paper presents a novel decentralized multi-agent pathfinding algorithm that leverages hierarchical task allocation to improve scalability and efficiency in complex environments. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines graph-based planning with distributed constraint optimization, enabling agents to adapt to dynamic obstacles and changing task priorities. Experimental results in a simulated warehouse scenario demonstrate that our approach reduces overall task completion time by 35% compared to existing decentralized methods, while maintaining a 25% decrease in communication overhead.
