Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed relational databases, as it significantly impacts system performance. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based systems, which can lead to suboptimal query plans. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution. Our framework, 'RL-Optimizer', learns to predict optimal query plans by interacting with the database environment and receiving feedback in the form of execution times. We demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in various scenarios, including joins, aggregations, and complex queries, while adapting to changing database workloads.
