In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'MATRL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. MATRL uses a hierarchical structure, where each agent maintains a local policy network that learns to allocate tasks based on its own capabilities and the global system state. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MATRL in simulated environments, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
