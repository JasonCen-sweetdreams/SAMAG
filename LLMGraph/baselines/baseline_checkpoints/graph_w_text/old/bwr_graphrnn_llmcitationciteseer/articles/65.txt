Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to scale and handle large volumes of data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization in distributed database systems. We model the query optimization problem as a graph optimization problem, where the graph represents the query execution plan and the vertices represent the operations in the plan. We develop an efficient algorithm that leverages the graph structure to identify the optimal query execution plan. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
