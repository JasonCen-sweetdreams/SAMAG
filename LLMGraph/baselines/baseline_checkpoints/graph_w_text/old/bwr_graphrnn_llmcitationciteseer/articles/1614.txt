Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural query expansion approach, called Hier QE, which leverages the strengths of both traditional and neural methods. Hier QE models the query-document interaction using a hierarchical attention mechanism, allowing it to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and document content. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Hier QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
