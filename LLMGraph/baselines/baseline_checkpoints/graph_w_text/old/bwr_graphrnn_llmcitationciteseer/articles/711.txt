Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing methods rely on simplistic user-item interaction models. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that captures complex relationships between users, items, and attributes. By incorporating graph attention mechanisms at multiple levels, our model generates personalized recommendations while providing interpretable explanations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of accuracy, diversity, and explainability.
