Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in enhancing learning experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized feedback on user engagement in VR-based learning environments. We designed a VR system that provides adaptive feedback based on users' learning styles, prior knowledge, and performance. Our user study involving 120 participants revealed that personalized feedback significantly increases user engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention compared to traditional, non-adaptive feedback methods. We also found that users' self-reported sense of presence and immersion in the VR environment positively correlates with their engagement levels.
