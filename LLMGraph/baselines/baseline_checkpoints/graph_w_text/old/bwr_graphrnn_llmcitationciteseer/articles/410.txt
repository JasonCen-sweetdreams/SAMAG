Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with visual impairments face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR experiences, focusing on auditory and haptic feedback mechanisms. We conducted a series of user studies with visually impaired participants, identifying key challenges and opportunities for inclusive design. Our proposed framework, 'AccessibleVR', incorporates real-time audio descriptions, 3D audio spatialization, and tactile feedback to facilitate navigation and interaction in VR environments. Results show significant improvements in user engagement and task completion rates, demonstrating the potential of AccessibleVR to expand the reach of VR technology to underserved communities.
