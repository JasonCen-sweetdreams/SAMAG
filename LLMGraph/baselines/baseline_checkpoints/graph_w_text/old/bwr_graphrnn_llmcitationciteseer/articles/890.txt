Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in data integration and knowledge graphs, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in a dataset. Existing approaches struggle to scale to large datasets and often rely on hand-crafted features. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages graph-based clustering and deep learning techniques to perform entity disambiguation. We propose a graph attention network that learns to represent entities and mentions in a shared vector space, allowing for efficient clustering and disambiguation. Experiments on a large-scale benchmark dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results with significant improvements in scalability.
