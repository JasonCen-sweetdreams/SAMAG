Conversational AI systems struggle to engage users in coherent and informative dialogues, often due to ineffective dialogue management. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based approach that integrates contextual understanding, intention recognition, and response generation. Our framework, 'HierDialog', utilizes multi-level attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant user input, dialogue history, and knowledge graph information. Experimental results demonstrate that HierDialog outperforms state-of-the-art dialogue management models in terms of dialogue coherence, fluency, and user satisfaction.
