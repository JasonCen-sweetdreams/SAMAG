Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but their design must be tailored to meet the unique needs of this population. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to developing accessible conversational interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of interviews and co-design workshops with older adults and their caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our findings led to the development of a prototype conversational interface that incorporates features such as simplified language, visual cues, and error forgiveness. A user study with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
