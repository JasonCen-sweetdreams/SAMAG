Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that not only detects anomalies but also provides explainable insights into the detection process. HAN consists of a hierarchical encoder that captures local and global patterns, followed by an attention mechanism that identifies the most relevant features contributing to the anomaly score. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and AUC-ROC, while providing visual explanations for the detected anomalies.
