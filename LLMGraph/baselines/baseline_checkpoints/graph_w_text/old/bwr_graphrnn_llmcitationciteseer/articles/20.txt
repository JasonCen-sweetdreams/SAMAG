Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, but existing methods struggle to achieve real-time performance on resource-constrained devices. This paper presents a novel hierarchical convolutional neural network (H-CNN) architecture that leverages a multi-scale feature fusion strategy to detect objects efficiently. Our approach reduces computational complexity by 30% compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive accuracy on the COCO dataset. We also propose a lightweight anchor-free module that eliminates the need for anchor boxes, further improving detection speed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our H-CNN model in real-world scenarios, including autonomous driving and surveillance applications.
