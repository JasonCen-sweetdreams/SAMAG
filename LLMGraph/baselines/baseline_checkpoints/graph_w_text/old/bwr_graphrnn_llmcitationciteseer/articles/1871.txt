Multi-agent planning is a challenging task due to the exponential growth of the joint action space. We introduce a novel approach that leverages deep graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective planning strategies. Our method, called 'GNN-MAPlan', represents the agent interaction graph as a learnable embedding and uses a neural planner to generate joint plans. We demonstrate that GNN-MAPlan outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark domains, including traffic management and robot coordination. Furthermore, we show that GNN-MAPlan can generalize to novel scenarios with varying numbers of agents.
