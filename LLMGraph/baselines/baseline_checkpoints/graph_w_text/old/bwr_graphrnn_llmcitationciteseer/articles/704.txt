In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks among agents. Our method, called GNN-TA, learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a graph and captures their relationships through edge features. We show that GNN-TA outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization in simulated environments with varying graph topologies and task distributions. The proposed approach enables real-time task allocation in decentralized multi-agent systems, with applications in robotics, smart cities, and IoT.
