Recommender systems have become essential for personalizing user experiences in various online platforms. However, most existing methods struggle to scale with the growing size of user-item interaction graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages the hierarchical structure of user behavior to efficiently model complex relationships between users and items. HGAT employs a multi-level attention mechanism to adaptively focus on relevant subgraphs, reducing computational complexity while improving recommendation accuracy. Our experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate HGAT's superior performance and scalability compared to state-of-the-art graph-based recommender systems.
