Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often pose significant accessibility barriers for this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create accessible VR interfaces tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with 15 older adults and 5 caregivers, resulting in the development of a set of design guidelines and recommendations for accessible VR interfaces. Our findings highlight the importance of simplifying navigation, using clear and consistent visual cues, and incorporating cognitive support features to facilitate engagement and independence.
