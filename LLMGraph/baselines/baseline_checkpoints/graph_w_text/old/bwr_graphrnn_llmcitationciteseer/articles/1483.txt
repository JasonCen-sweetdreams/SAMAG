This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing gesture-based interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants with mild cognitive impairment, exploring their gesture preferences, recognition accuracy, and usability experiences. Our findings inform the development of a novel gesture set, 'EasyReach', which incorporates simplicity, consistency, and feedback mechanisms. A subsequent evaluation with 30 older adults showed significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing gesture-based systems. Our work contributes to the development of more inclusive and accessible HCI systems for older adults with cognitive impairments.
