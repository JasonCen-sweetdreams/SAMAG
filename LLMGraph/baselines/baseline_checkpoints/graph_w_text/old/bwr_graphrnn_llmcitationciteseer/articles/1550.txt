Decentralized task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem due to the need to balance individual agent goals with global system efficiency. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn a decentralized task allocation policy. Our method, called DAGCAT, represents the agent network as a graph and uses GCNs to learn a task allocation strategy that adapts to changing graph structures. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that DAGCAT outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
