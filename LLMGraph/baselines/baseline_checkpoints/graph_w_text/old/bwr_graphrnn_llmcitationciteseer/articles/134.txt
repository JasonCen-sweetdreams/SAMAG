Gestural interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern computing, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with motor impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive gestural interfaces that accommodate the unique abilities and challenges of this population. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key factors influencing gesture recognition accuracy and developed a set of design guidelines for creating more accessible and usable gestural interfaces. Our approach leverages machine learning-based gesture recognition and incorporates adaptive feedback mechanisms to facilitate learning and improvement.
