Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has gained significant attention in natural language processing. However, existing approaches often rely on cumbersome feature engineering and fail to capture nuanced aspect-specific sentiment. This paper proposes a novel document representation learning framework, 'AspectRep', which jointly learns aspect embeddings and sentiment representations in a unified neural architecture. We introduce a contrastive loss function that encourages aspect embeddings to be closer to their corresponding sentiment representations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that AspectRep outperforms state-of-the-art ABSA models in terms of both aspect extraction and sentiment classification accuracy.
