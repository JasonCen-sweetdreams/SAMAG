This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) environments to enhance user experience and interaction. We design and evaluate a novel gesture-based interaction system that leverages proprioception and kinesthetic feedback to facilitate intuitive object manipulation in VR. Our user study shows that the embodied cognition approach improves task performance, reduces cognitive load, and increases user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. The results have implications for the design of VR systems that can effectively leverage human motor skills and cognitive abilities.
