Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their complexity can pose significant barriers for older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible conversational interfaces that accommodate the needs of this demographic. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and developed a set of design guidelines for simplifying conversation flows, enhancing visual cues, and providing cognitive support. Our evaluation of a prototype system demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction among older adults with cognitive impairments.
