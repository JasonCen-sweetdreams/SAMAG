Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NQE', which leverages dense vector representations to capture semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our method employs a siamese neural network to learn query-document embeddings, allowing for efficient and effective expansion of the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, with NQE outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
