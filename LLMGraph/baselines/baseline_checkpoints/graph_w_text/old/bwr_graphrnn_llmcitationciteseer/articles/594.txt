In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'HeurAgent', which leverages heuristic search techniques to assign tasks to agents. HeurAgent exploits problem structure to prune the search space, reducing communication overhead and improving allocation quality. We evaluate HeurAgent on a range of benchmark problems, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and team utility compared to state-of-the-art distributed allocation methods.
