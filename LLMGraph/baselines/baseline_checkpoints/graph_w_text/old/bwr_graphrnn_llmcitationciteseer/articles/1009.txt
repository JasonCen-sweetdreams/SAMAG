Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with motor impairments. However, current systems often fail to account for the unique challenges faced by this population. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an accessible gesture recognition system tailored to the needs of older adults with motor impairments. Our system utilizes a novel combination of machine learning algorithms and sensor-based data to recognize gestures with high accuracy, even in the presence of motor variability. Results from a user study with 20 older adults demonstrate significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
