Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, their lack of interpretability hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that not only detects anomalies accurately but also provides explainable insights into the detection process. Our HAN model consists of a hierarchical encoder that learns multi-scale temporal dependencies and an attention mechanism that highlights the most relevant segments contributing to the anomaly score. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies and providing interpretable explanations.
