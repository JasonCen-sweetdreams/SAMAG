In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient allocation of tasks to agents to maximize system performance. This paper proposes a novel distributed coalition formation algorithm, 'DCFA', that enables agents to form coalitions and allocate tasks in a decentralized manner. DCFA uses a distributed constraint optimization approach to find optimal coalitions and task assignments, taking into account agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DCFA outperforms existing centralized and decentralized approaches in terms of system utility and response time.
