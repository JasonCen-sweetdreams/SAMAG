Virtual reality (VR) systems have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper presents an emotive avatar-based feedback system, 'EmoVR', which leverages affective computing and social presence cues to enhance user experience in VR environments. We investigate the impact of emotionally expressive avatars on user engagement, cognitive load, and overall system usability. Our results show that EmoVR significantly increases user enjoyment, reduces cognitive load, and improves overall system satisfaction in a virtual shopping scenario.
