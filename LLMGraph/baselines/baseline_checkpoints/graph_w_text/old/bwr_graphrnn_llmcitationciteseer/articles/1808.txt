Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficiently retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach, which leverages a combination of sparse and dense representations to improve retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Our method uses a hierarchical indexing structure to prune irrelevant documents and a dense passage encoder to perform similarity search. Experiments on popular ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that HDR achieves state-of-the-art results while reducing retrieval latency by up to 75% compared to existing dense retrieval methods.
