Temporal graphs have become increasingly popular for modeling dynamic networks, but existing indexing techniques are inefficient for real-time analytics. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'ChronoGraph', which leverages the temporal locality of graph updates to reduce query latency. We introduce a hybrid indexing strategy that combines a compact, disk-based index with an in-memory cache, achieving a 3x speedup over state-of-the-art indexing techniques. Experiments on large-scale temporal graph datasets demonstrate the efficacy of ChronoGraph for real-time graph analytics, including shortest path queries and graph pattern matching.
