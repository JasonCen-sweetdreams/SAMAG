Integrating data from diverse sources is a crucial step in data analysis, but it is often hindered by the presence of heterogeneous data formats and schemas. This paper proposes a novel approach to data integration using knowledge graph embeddings, which can effectively capture the complex relationships between entities across different data sources. We introduce a new embedding algorithm, 'HetEmbed', that leverages both structural and semantic information to learn dense vector representations of entities. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HetEmbed outperforms existing data integration methods in terms of entity matching accuracy and query performance.
