The proliferation of large-scale RDF graph datasets has created a pressing need for efficient query optimization techniques in distributed settings. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DistRDF', which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, join ordering, and parallel processing to accelerate query execution. Our experiments on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that DistRDF outperforms state-of-the-art distributed query engines by up to 3.5x in terms of query response time, while maintaining a high degree of scalability and fault tolerance.
