In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized algorithm, 'RT-CARP', that leverages real-time constraint reasoning to optimize task allocation among autonomous agents. By integrating constraint propagation with graph-based planning, RT-CARP ensures that tasks are allocated based on agent capabilities, resource availability, and temporal constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RT-CARP in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to centralized allocation approaches.
