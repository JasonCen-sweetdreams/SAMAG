We present a novel decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments. Our approach, dubbed 'DynaTAS', leverages a combination of graph-based task representation and distributed constraint optimization to efficiently allocate tasks to agents in real-time. We show that DynaTAS outperforms existing centralized and decentralized approaches in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and adaptability to environmental changes. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaTAS in dynamic, real-world environments.
