In multi-agent systems, negotiation is a crucial aspect of decision-making, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper proposes an adaptive negotiation strategy, 'DynaNeg', which integrates reinforcement learning with cognitive architectures to enable agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions. DynaNeg utilizes a novel attention-based mechanism to selectively focus on relevant negotiation parameters, thereby improving negotiation outcomes in uncertain scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that DynaNeg outperforms existing negotiation strategies in realistic scenarios, achieving higher agreement rates and improved overall utility.
