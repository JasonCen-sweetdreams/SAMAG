Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper introduces HATS, a novel hierarchical attention network for explainable time-series anomaly detection. HATS employs a multi-level attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant segments and features, generating interpretable anomaly scores. We evaluate HATS on three real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and explainability.
