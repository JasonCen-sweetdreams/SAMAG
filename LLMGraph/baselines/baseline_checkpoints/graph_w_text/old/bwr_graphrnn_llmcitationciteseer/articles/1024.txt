As the global population ages, designing accessible interfaces for older adults becomes increasingly important. This study explores the development of multimodal interfaces that combine gesture recognition and speech synthesis to enhance user experience. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, evaluating the effectiveness of our interface in facilitating communication and information exchange. Results show significant improvements in usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of inclusive and age-friendly HCI systems.
