Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used to handle massive datasets, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel, adaptive query optimization framework, 'AQOpe', which leverages machine learning and statistical analysis to dynamically optimize query plans in DDS. AQOpe integrates a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group queries based on their access patterns, and employs a deep reinforcement learning model to adapt query optimization strategies to changing workloads. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that AQOpe achieves up to 40% improvement in query execution time and 25% reduction in resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
