As multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need for explainable decision-making frameworks. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables agents to selectively focus on relevant information when making decisions. Our approach integrates attention mechanisms at both the local and global levels, allowing agents to contextualize their own actions within the broader system dynamics. Experiments on a simulated robotic soccer environment demonstrate that HAN-based agents outperform traditional decision-making approaches in terms of both task performance and explainability.
