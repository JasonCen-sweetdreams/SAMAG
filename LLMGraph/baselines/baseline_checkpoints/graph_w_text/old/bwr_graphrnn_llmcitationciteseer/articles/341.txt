Deep neural ranking models have revolutionized the field of ad-hoc retrieval, but the role of query expansion in these models remains understudied. This paper investigates the effect of query expansion on the performance of deep neural ranking models, specifically BERT-based architectures. We propose a novel query expansion framework that incorporates both local and global context, and evaluate its impact on retrieval effectiveness using standard TREC datasets. Our results show that carefully designed query expansion can significantly improve the performance of deep neural ranking models, especially for queries with limited relevance feedback.
