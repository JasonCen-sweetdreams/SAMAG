Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a complex and time-consuming task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to efficiently optimize query execution plans. Our approach, dubbed 'RL-Opt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on runtime statistics and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that RL-Opt outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
