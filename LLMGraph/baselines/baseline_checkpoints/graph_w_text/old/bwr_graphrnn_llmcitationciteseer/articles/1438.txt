Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained increasing attention in recent years, as they provide transparency and accountability in decision-making processes. This paper proposes a novel approach to ERS by incorporating deep knowledge graph embeddings (DKGE) into a hybrid recommendation model. We design a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes knowledge graph embedding, item representation, and recommendation tasks. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explainability.
