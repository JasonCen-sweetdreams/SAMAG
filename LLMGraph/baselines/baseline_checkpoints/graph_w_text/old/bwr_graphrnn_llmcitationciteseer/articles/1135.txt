Query expansion techniques are crucial for effective document retrieval in specialized domains. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational costs and inadequate domain adaptation. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HiQE', which leverages a two-stage approach to balance precision and recall. In the first stage, we employ a neural language model to generate a set of candidate expansion terms, which are then filtered and ranked using a domain-specific ontology. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HiQE over state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and query response time.
