Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often overlooks the needs of older adults. This study investigates age-related differences in voice command comprehension, focusing on the impact of cognitive decline, hearing loss, and linguistic complexity. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants, aged 25-85, who interacted with a custom-built voice assistant. Our results show that older adults face significant barriers in understanding voice commands, particularly when they contain complex syntax, idioms, or ambiguous words. We present a set of design guidelines for creating more inclusive voice assistants, including the use of simple, concrete language, and adaptive feedback mechanisms that accommodate individual differences in comprehension.
