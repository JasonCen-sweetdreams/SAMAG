Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and system dynamics. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-Optimizer', which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively select the optimal query plan. We design a customized RL environment that simulates the DDS and train an RL agent to learn the optimal query plan based on the system state and query characteristics. Experimental results on a real-world DDS dataset demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
