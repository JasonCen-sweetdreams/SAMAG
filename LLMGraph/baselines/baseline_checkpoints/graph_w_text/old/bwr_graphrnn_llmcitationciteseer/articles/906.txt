Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular due to their ability to scale and handle large amounts of data. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans. Our method, called 'QLearn', learns to predict the optimal plan based on the query workload, database statistics, and system conditions. We evaluate QLearn on a real-world distributed database and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
