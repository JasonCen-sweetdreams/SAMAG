Voice assistants, like Alexa and Google Assistant, have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their design often excludes older adults. This paper presents a participatory design study with 20 older adults (65+ years) to co-create an inclusive voice assistant. We identified key challenges, including speech recognition errors, complex invocation phrases, and lack of personalized feedback. Our proposed design, 'ElderVoice', incorporates senior-centric features, such as explicit error handling, simple phrase recognition, and personalized auditory cues. Our user studies show that ElderVoice improves task completion rates and overall user experience for older adults.
