The proliferation of IoT devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation mechanisms. This paper proposes a distributed agent-based framework, 'IoT-Agent', which leverages autonomous decision-making entities to allocate resources in large-scale IoT systems. Each agent employs a hybrid approach combining reinforcement learning and constraint programming to optimize resource utilization. We evaluate IoT-Agent on a real-world smart building dataset, demonstrating improved resource allocation efficiency and reduced latency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
