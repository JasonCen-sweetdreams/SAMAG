Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and climate science. Despite the success of deep learning models, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying factors driving their predictions. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that simultaneously improves forecasting performance and provides explainable insights into the temporal dependencies and feature importance. Our approach exploits both local and global attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant time segments and features, resulting in improved accuracy and transparency. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in capturing complex patterns and relationships, while offering meaningful explanations for its predictions.
