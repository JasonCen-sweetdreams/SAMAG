Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including aerospace, healthcare, and finance. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages self-attention mechanisms to model complex temporal relationships and capture contextual information. The hierarchical design enables the model to focus on relevant segments of the time series, facilitating interpretable anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies and providing insights into the underlying data dynamics.
