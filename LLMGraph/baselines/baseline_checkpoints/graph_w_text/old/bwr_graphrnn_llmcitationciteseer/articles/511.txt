Distributed database systems are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but optimizing query performance remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust query execution plans based on real-time system metrics. Our approach, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan selection policy that minimizes query latency and maximizes system throughput. Experimental results on a distributed database benchmark demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of average query response time.
