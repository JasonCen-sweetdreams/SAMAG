Traditional retrieval models often suffer from high computational costs and poor performance on large document collections. This paper presents HNR, a hierarchical neural ranking model that leverages a novel document representation scheme and a query-dependent attention mechanism to improve retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNR outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both retrieval performance and computational efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world search applications.
