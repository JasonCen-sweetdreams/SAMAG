This paper addresses the challenging problem of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have varying capabilities and strengths. We propose a decentralized framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal task allocation strategies. Our approach utilizes a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn the value function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a simulated search and rescue scenario, achieving significant improvements in task completion rate and agent utilization compared to traditional centralized methods.
