In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a key challenge that affects overall performance and efficiency. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework based on auction mechanisms, where agents bid for tasks based on their capabilities and resource availability. We introduce a novel auction protocol that incorporates mechanisms for mitigating the winner's curse phenomenon and promoting socially optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
