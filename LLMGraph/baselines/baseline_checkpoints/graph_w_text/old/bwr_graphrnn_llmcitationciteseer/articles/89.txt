Distributed relational databases are increasingly used to store and manage large amounts of data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query optimization, which leverages the structural properties of the database schema to identify opportunities for optimization. Our approach, called GraphOpt, uses graph algorithms to identify join orders, subquery optimization, and indexing opportunities, and demonstrates significant improvements in query performance compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that GraphOpt reduces query execution time by up to 50% and improves system throughput by up to 30%.
