This paper proposes a novel co-training framework for neural ranking models in ad-hoc retrieval, where a primary ranker is trained in tandem with an auxiliary ranker that operates on document expansions. The primary ranker learns to re-rank documents based on relevance, while the auxiliary ranker learns to generate expansions that enhance the representation of relevant documents. Our approach leverages the strengths of both neural ranking and document expansion techniques, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. Experiments demonstrate that our co-training framework improves retrieval effectiveness, particularly for rare or ambiguous queries.
