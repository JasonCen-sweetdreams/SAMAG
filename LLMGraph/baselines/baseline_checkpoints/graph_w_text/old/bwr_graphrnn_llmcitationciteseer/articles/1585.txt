Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization, which models the database as a graph and leverages graph neural networks to predict optimal query plans. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, achieving significant improvements in query latency and throughput compared to traditional optimization techniques.
