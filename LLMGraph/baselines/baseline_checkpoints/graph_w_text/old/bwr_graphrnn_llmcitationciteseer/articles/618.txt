Optimizing query performance is crucial in distributed database systems. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query plans in response to changing workload and system conditions. We propose a novel framework, 'RL-Opt', which leverages a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given query and environment. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional rule-based optimization techniques, with an average reduction of 32% in query execution time.
