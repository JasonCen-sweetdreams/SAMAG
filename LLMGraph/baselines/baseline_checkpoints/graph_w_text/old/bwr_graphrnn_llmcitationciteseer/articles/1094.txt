Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem in various domains, such as robotics, smart grids, and social networks. This paper proposes a novel approach using Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT) to learn effective coordination strategies. HGAT leverages the graph structure of agent interactions and attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their relationships. We evaluate our approach on a set of benchmark problems and demonstrate improved performance in terms of coordination efficiency and adaptability to changing environments. Theoretical analysis and experiments show that HGAT outperforms existing methods, especially in scenarios with heterogeneous agent capabilities and dynamically changing agent relationships.
