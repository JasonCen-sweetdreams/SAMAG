In multi-agent systems, trust plays a crucial role in decision-making processes. However, existing approaches often rely on static trust models that fail to adapt to dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel adaptive trust-based decision-making framework, 'ATDM', which integrates machine learning and game theory to facilitate more informed and resilient decision-making. ATDM employs a probabilistic trust model that updates in real-time based on agent interactions, enabling agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and mitigate potential threats. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of ATDM in improving system resilience and reducing the impact of malicious agents.
