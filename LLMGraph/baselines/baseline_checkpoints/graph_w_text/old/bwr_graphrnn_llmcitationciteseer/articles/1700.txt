Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by speech recognition errors and lack of intuitive error recovery mechanisms. This study investigates the impact of age-related speech characteristics on voice assistant performance and proposes a novel error recovery framework that incorporates contextual understanding and adaptive feedback. Our user study with 30 older adults shows that the proposed framework significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants. We also provide design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults.
