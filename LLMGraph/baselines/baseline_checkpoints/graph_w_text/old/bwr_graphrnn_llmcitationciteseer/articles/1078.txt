Zero-shot learning (ZSL) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to recognize unseen classes without training data. However, existing ZSL methods suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large-scale datasets and complex relationships between classes. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that addresses these limitations by modeling class relationships as a hierarchical graph. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant class relationships, enabling efficient information propagation and improved ZSL performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in achieving state-of-the-art performance on large-scale ZSL tasks.
