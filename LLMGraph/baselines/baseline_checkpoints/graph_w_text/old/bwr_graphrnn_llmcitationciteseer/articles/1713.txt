Cold start problems in recommender systems arise when there is a lack of user-item interaction data, leading to poor model performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based framework, 'HARE', which leverages item-side information to generate explanations for recommendations. Our approach combines a self-attention mechanism with a hierarchical graph neural network to model complex item relationships. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HARE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cold start scenarios, providing interpretable recommendations and improving user satisfaction.
