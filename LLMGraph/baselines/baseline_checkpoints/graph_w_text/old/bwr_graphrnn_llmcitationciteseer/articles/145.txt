Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but people with disabilities often face significant barriers to adoption. We present a novel framework that integrates multimodal feedback to enhance accessibility in VR environments. Our approach combines haptic, auditory, and visual cues to provide users with disabilities with a more immersive and inclusive experience. We evaluate our framework through a user study with participants with visual impairments and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction.
