Graph-based neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in node classification tasks, but most existing methods are transductive, requiring the entire graph at training time. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that enables inductive node classification, where new nodes can be added to the graph at test time. HGAN leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively aggregate features from neighboring nodes, improving performance on nodes with limited local information. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in inductive node classification, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.
