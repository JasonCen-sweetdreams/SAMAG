Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems to improve the retrieval performance. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and may not effectively capture the nuances of natural language queries. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'NeuroExpander', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate query expansions. Our approach uses a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query expansion and relevance ranking tasks. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExpander outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness to query variations.
