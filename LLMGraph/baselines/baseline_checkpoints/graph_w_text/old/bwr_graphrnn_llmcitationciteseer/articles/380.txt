Entity retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant entities for a given query. One of the major challenges in entity retrieval is dealing with the lexical gap between the query and the indexed entities. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages BERT-based semantic clustering to bridge this gap. Our approach clusters the query terms based on their semantic meaning and expands the query with relevant terms from the clusters. Experimental results on a large-scale entity retrieval dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving an average increase of 15.2% in mean average precision.
