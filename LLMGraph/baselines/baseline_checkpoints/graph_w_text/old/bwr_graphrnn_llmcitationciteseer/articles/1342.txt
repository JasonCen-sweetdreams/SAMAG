Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with ambiguous or incomplete queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion technique, 'RL-QE', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to selectively incorporate relevant terms from the indexed documents. Our approach learns to optimize a reward function that balances query preciseness and recall, outperforming traditional methods like Rocchio and relevance feedback. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
