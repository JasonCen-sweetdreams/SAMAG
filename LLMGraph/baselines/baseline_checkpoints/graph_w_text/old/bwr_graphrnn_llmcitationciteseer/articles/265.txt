Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their usability for users with disabilities remains a significant concern. This paper presents a comprehensive study on designing inclusive voice assistants, focusing on conversational strategies that cater to users with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive disabilities. We propose a novel framework, 'InConverse', which incorporates adaptive dialogue management, personalized feedback, and multimodal output. Our evaluations with 30 participants with disabilities demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates, user satisfaction, and accessibility compared to commercial voice assistants.
