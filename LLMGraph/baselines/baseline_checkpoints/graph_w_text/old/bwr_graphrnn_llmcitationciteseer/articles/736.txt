This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) environments to enhance learning outcomes. We designed a gesture-based interaction system that leverages users' bodily experiences to improve cognitive understanding of complex concepts. Our study involved 30 participants who interacted with a VR-based educational platform, and the results show significant improvements in retention and recall compared to traditional keyboard-mouse interfaces. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more effective and engaging VR-based learning experiences.
