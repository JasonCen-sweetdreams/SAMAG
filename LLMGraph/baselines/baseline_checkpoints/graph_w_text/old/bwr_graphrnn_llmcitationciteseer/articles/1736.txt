Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR experiences tailored to the needs of visually impaired users. We conducted a user study to identify key challenges and preferences, and developed a set of guidelines for VR designers. Our framework incorporates audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized assistance to facilitate immersive and inclusive VR interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study on a VR-based art gallery.
