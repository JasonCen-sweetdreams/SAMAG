Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) rely on efficient traffic routing to reduce congestion and improve travel times. This paper presents a novel autonomous agent-based traffic routing framework, 'SmartRoute', which leverages real-time vehicular network data to optimize routing decisions. SmartRoute utilizes a decentralized multi-agent system, where each agent is responsible for a specific road segment, to dynamically adjust traffic signal timings and route assignments. Experimental results using a large-scale simulation of San Francisco's traffic network show that SmartRoute reduces average travel times by 23% and decreases congestion by 17% compared to traditional centralized routing approaches.
