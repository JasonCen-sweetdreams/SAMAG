Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. One effective approach is query expansion, which aims to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based query expansion framework, 'DeepQE', which leverages neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. DeepQE incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively weigh term importance and a novel training objective that encourages diversity in the expanded query terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving improvements of up to 15% in mean average precision.
