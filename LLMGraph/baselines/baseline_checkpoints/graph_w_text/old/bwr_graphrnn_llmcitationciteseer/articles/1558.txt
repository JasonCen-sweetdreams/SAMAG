Domain-specific search engines often struggle to balance query representation and document retrieval efficiency. This paper proposes a novel deep hierarchical query expansion (DHQE) approach that leverages domain knowledge to generate a hierarchical representation of query concepts. Our method employs a neural network-based query encoder to learn a dense representation of the query, which is then expanded using a hierarchical clustering algorithm. Experimental results on a large-scale biomedical search engine dataset demonstrate that DHQE significantly improves retrieval efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art retrieval performance.
