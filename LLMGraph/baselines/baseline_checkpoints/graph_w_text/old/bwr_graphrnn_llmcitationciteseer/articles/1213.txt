Time series forecasting techniques often suffer from a lack of interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying decision-making process. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable time series forecasting. The proposed model employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant time series segments and features, generating interpretable attention weights that provide insights into the forecasting process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving forecasting accuracy and providing meaningful explanations.
