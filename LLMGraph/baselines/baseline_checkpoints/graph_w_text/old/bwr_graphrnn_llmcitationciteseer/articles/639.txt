The increasing scale and complexity of IoT networks necessitate efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper proposes a decentralized agent-based framework, 'IoTAgent', that enables autonomous decision-making at the edge. IoTAgent leverages multi-agent systems and distributed constraint optimization to allocate resources in real-time, minimizing latency and energy consumption. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization and network performance compared to traditional centralized approaches.
