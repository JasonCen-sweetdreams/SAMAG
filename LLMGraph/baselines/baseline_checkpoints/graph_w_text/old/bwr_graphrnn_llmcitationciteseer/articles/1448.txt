As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly ubiquitous, secure authentication mechanisms are crucial to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. This paper presents a novel gaze-based authentication approach for AR systems using deep neural networks. Our method, 'GazeNet', leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze the user's gaze patterns and classify them as authentic or impostor. We evaluate GazeNet on a dataset of 100 users and demonstrate a significant improvement in authentication accuracy compared to traditional password-based methods. Our approach has far-reaching implications for secure AR interactions in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and education.
