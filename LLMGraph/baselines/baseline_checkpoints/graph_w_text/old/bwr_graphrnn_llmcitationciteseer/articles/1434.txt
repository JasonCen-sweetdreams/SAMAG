Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various industries, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effects of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 100 participants, where half were assigned a generic avatar and the other half created their own personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars led to a significant increase in user engagement, measured through self-reported surveys and behavioral metrics. Furthermore, we found that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of presence and immersion in the VR environment. The findings of this study have implications for the design of future VR systems, highlighting the importance of personalization in enhancing user experience.
