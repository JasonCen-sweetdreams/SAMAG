Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents from a large corpus. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense representation (HDR) framework that captures both local and global semantic relationships between passages and questions. We introduce a two-stage retrieval approach, where a coarse-grained model selects top-k passages based on their relevance to the question, and a fine-grained model refines the selection using HDR-based similarity scores. Experimental results on the Natural Questions benchmark demonstrate that our approach improves retrieval efficiency by 30% while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.
