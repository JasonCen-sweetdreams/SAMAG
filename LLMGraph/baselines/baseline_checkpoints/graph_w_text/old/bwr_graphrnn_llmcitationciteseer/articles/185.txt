Virtual reality (VR) systems often rely on manual controllers for interaction, limiting the sense of immersion. This paper presents a gaze-based interaction system using deep learning-based eye movement prediction. Our approach leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the user's gaze direction and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to anticipate the intended interaction target. We evaluate our system using a VR headset with integrated eye-tracking and demonstrate a significant reduction in interaction latency and error rate compared to traditional manual control methods.
