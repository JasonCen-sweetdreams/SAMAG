In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving system-wide objectives. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments for heterogeneous agents with varying capabilities and resource constraints. Our approach, called Distributed Task Allocation with Reinforcement Learning (DTARL), utilizes a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn task assignment policies that maximize system performance. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that DTARL outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
