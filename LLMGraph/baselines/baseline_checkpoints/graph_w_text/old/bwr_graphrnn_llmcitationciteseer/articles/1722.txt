Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. Graph-based methods have shown promising results in ERS, but they often suffer from scalability issues. This paper proposes Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical graph attention mechanisms to learn node representations and generate explanations. HGAT is designed to handle large-scale graphs and provides a fine-grained explanation of the recommendation process. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
