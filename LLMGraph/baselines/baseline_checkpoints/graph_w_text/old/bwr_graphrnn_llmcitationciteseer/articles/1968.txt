Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a complex task due to the inherent complexity of graph data and the distributed nature of the system. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called GraphQL, learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database and receiving feedback in the form of execution times. We evaluate GraphQL on a real-world graph dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
