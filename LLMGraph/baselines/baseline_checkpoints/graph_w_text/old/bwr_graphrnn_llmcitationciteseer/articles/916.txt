This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed a gesture-based interaction system that leverages the embodied experience of users to enhance their cognitive performance in spatial reasoning tasks. Our user study with 30 participants shows that the gesture-based interaction significantly improves task accuracy and reduces cognitive load compared to traditional controller-based interaction. We also analyze the neural correlates of embodied cognition using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and find increased activity in the motor cortex and prefrontal cortex during gesture-based interaction. The results have implications for the design of more intuitive and effective VR interfaces.
