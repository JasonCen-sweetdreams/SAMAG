Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR game using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, measured through physiological and subjective metrics. We also identify key factors influencing avatar personalization, including facial similarity and body type matching. Our findings have implications for designing more immersive and engaging VR experiences.
