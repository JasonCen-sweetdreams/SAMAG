Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a question. This paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Dense Passage Retrieval (HDPR), which leverages hierarchical dense representations to efficiently index and search passages. HDPR uses a combination of dense and sparse representations to capture both local and global semantic relationships between passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDPR outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in terms of both efficiency and accuracy, achieving a 30% reduction in latency while maintaining a 2% improvement in top-1 passage retrieval accuracy.
