In distributed environments, efficient task allocation is crucial for maximizing system performance. This paper presents a novel hierarchical task allocation framework that leverages self-organizing agents to adapt to dynamic changes in the system. Our approach, called 'HATA', uses a decentralized, hierarchical organization of agents to allocate tasks based on their capabilities and availability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HATA through simulations on a distributed cloud computing platform, showing significant improvements in task completion time and system utilization compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
