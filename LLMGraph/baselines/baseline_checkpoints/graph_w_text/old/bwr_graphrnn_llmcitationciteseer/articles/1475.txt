Multi-label classification tasks often involve complex relationships between labels, making it challenging to model their dependencies. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel graph-based approach that leverages hierarchical label structures to improve multi-label classification performance. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to recursively aggregate label information, capturing nuanced relationships between labels at multiple scales. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in macro-F1 score and label ranking quality.
