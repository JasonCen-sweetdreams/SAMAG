As robots become increasingly prevalent in human environments, effective human-robot collaboration is crucial. This paper explores the role of embodiment in virtual reality (VR) on human trust and task performance in human-robot collaborative scenarios. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR platform and a robotic arm. Our results show that embodied agents in VR lead to higher user trust and better task performance compared to non-embodied agents. We also identify key design factors that influence user trust, including robot anthropomorphism and gesture recognition. Our findings have implications for the design of human-robot collaborative systems in VR and beyond.
