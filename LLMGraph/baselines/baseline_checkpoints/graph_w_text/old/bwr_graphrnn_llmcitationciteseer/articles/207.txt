Distributed database systems often suffer from poor query performance due to data replication and caching issues. This paper presents a novel cache-aware replication strategy that dynamically adjusts data placement based on query patterns and cache hit rates. Our approach, called 'CacheOpt', uses a machine learning-based predictor to identify hotspots in the query workload and proactively replicate data to minimize cache misses. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that CacheOpt reduces query latency by up to 30% compared to existing replication strategies, while maintaining a comparable level of data consistency.
