Virtual reality (VR) has seen significant growth, but creating an immersive user experience remains a challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatar embodiment on user experience in VR. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR environment using either a generic or personalized avatar. Results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user engagement, sense of presence, and enjoyment. We also found that users with high embodiment scores reported higher levels of anxiety reduction and self-efficacy. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems, suggesting that personalized avatars can enhance user experience and foster a sense of agency.
