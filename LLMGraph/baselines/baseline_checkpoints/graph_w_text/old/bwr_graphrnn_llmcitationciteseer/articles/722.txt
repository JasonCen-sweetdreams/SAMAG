Multi-tenant database systems (MTDS) are increasingly popular for cloud-based services, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query plans in MTDS. We formulate query optimization as a Markov decision process and train an RL agent to learn optimal query plans based on runtime feedback. Our experimental results on a real-world MTDS dataset show that our RL-based approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
