Distributed graph databases have emerged as a scalable solution for storing and querying massive graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph traversal and data distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph summarization and machine learning-based estimation techniques to efficiently identify optimal query plans. Our experiments on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt achieves an average speedup of 3.5x over existing query optimization techniques, while maintaining high accuracy and scalability.
