In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and decentralized decision-making. This paper proposes a novel approach based on stochastic Nash equilibrium, which enables agents to allocate tasks in a distributed manner while considering uncertainty and conflicting objectives. We formulate the task allocation problem as a stochastic game and solve it using a novel sampling-based algorithm. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
