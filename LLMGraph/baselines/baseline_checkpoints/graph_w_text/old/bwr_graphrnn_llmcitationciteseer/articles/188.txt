Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between the user's query and the document collection. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic query representations. Our model incorporates a multi-task learning framework, jointly optimizing query expansion and relevance ranking. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE significantly outperforms traditional QE methods, improving both retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
