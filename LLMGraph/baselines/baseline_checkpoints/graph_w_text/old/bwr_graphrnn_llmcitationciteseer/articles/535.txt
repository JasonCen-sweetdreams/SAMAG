Coordinating multiple agents in complex systems is a challenging problem, particularly when agents interact with each other and their environment in a decentralized manner. We propose a novel approach that leverages hierarchical graph attention networks (HGATs) to learn effective coordination strategies. Our method represents the system as a hierarchical graph, where agents are grouped into clusters based on their interactions. HGATs are then used to learn attention weights that capture the importance of each agent's actions and observations at different levels of the hierarchy. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of coordination efficiency and scalability.
