Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments often face significant barriers to accessing VR experiences. This paper presents a novel, inclusive VR design framework that incorporates audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized accessibility settings. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with visual impairments, demonstrating that our framework improves navigation efficiency, reduces cognitive load, and enhances overall user experience. Our findings provide actionable design guidelines for creating more accessible and inclusive VR environments.
