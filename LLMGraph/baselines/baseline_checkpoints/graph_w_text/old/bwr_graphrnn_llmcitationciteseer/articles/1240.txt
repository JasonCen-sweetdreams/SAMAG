The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors has led to an explosion of time-series data, posing significant challenges for efficient storage and query processing in distributed database systems. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'TS-Tree', which leverages a combination of spatial and temporal locality to minimize query latency and reduce storage overhead. We demonstrate that TS-Tree outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods on a variety of real-world time-series datasets, achieving an average query speedup of 3.2x and storage savings of 25%.
