Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph structures and the need to balance performance and scalability. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, indexing, and parallel processing techniques to minimize query latency and maximize throughput. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt achieves significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
