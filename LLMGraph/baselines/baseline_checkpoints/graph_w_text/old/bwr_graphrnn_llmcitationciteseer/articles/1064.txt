Column-oriented in-memory databases have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to efficiently process analytical workloads. However, query optimization remains a challenging task in these systems. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and dynamic reordering of query operators to minimize execution time. We evaluate ColOpt on a range of real-world benchmarks and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers. Our approach is particularly effective for complex queries involving multiple joins and aggregations.
