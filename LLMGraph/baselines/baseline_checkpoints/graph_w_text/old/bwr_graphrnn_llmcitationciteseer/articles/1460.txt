We propose a distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinating autonomous vehicles in complex urban scenarios. Our approach, called 'Distributed Autonomous Vehicle Coordination' (DAVC), enables vehicles to learn cooperative behaviors and adapt to changing traffic conditions. DAVC uses a decentralized Markov decision process to model vehicle interactions and a novel communication protocol to facilitate information exchange between agents. Simulation results demonstrate that DAVC reduces travel times by up to 30% and improves traffic safety compared to traditional rule-based control methods.
