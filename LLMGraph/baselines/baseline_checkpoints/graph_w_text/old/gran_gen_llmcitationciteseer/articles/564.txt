As robots become increasingly ubiquitous in our daily lives, effective human-robot collaboration is crucial. This paper explores the role of embodiment in virtual environments on human-robot collaboration. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a mixed-reality platform to simulate a collaborative task. Our results show that embodied robots, which have a virtual body, lead to improved collaboration outcomes, increased trust, and reduced errors compared to non-embodied robots. We identify key design implications for the development of embodied robots in virtual environments and discuss the potential applications in fields such as healthcare and education.
