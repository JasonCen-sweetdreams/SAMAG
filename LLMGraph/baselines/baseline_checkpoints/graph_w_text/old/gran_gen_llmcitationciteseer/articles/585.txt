This paper explores the application of embodied cognition theory to virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed an experiment to investigate how users' bodily experiences influence their cognitive processes in VR. Our results show that gestures can enhance spatial reasoning and working memory in VR, and that users' self-reported sense of embodiment is positively correlated with task performance. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more effective and engaging VR interfaces.
