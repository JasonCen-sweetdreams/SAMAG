Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a question. However, existing passage retrieval methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural retrieval framework, 'HNRF', which leverages a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy to efficiently identify top-ranked passages. Our approach combines a sparse retrieval module with a dense neural ranker, achieving a 3x speedup compared to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. We evaluate HNRF on several ODQA benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world question answering scenarios.
