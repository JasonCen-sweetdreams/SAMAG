The increasing adoption of autonomous agents in various domains has created a need for efficient task allocation mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). Our approach leverages a novel combination of constraint propagation and local search to solve the task allocation problem in a distributed manner. Experimental results on a realistic logistics scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms centralized methods in terms of solution quality and scalability, while reducing communication overhead by up to 75%.
