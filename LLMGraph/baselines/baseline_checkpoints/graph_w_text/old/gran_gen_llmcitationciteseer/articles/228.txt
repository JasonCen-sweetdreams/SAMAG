The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in smart grids poses significant challenges to efficient energy distribution. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent system, where heterogeneous agents representing different grid components (e.g., generators, load managers, and energy storages) learn to coordinate their actions to optimize multiple objectives, including energy efficiency, cost, and reliability. We develop a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep Q-networks with a hierarchical clustering approach to handle the large action space and mitigate the curse of dimensionality. Experimental results on a real-world smart grid dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving a better trade-off among competing objectives compared to traditional centralized optimization methods.
