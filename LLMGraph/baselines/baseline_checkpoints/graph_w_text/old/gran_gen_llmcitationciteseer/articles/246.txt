Designing effective dialogue systems for multi-agent interactions is a challenging task, particularly when agents have diverse goals and preferences. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that models complex relationships between agents and their dialogue contexts. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to learn representations of agents' utterances and their dependencies, and hierarchically aggregates these representations to generate context-aware responses. Experimental results on a large-scale multi-agent dialogue dataset demonstrate that HGAT significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of response relevance and coherence.
