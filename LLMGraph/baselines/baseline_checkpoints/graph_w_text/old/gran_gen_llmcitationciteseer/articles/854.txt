Explainable recommendation systems have gained increasing attention in recent years, as they provide users with transparent and trustworthy suggestions. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model, which integrates graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical pooling to capture complex item relationships and provide interpretable recommendations. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality, while also providing insights into the decision-making process.
