As human-robot collaboration (HRC) becomes increasingly prevalent, recognizing human intentions in real-time is crucial for efficient and safe interaction. This paper presents a novel approach to gaze-based intention recognition, leveraging deep learning models to classify human gaze patterns into distinct intentions (e.g., grasping, manipulating, or inspecting). Our system, 'GazeIntention', integrates a wearable eye-tracker with a robot's computer vision system, enabling the robot to anticipate and respond to human actions more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that GazeIntention outperforms state-of-the-art intention recognition methods, achieving an accuracy of 92.5% in a simulated HRC scenario.
