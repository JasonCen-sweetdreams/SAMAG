Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weights term importance based on the query context. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
