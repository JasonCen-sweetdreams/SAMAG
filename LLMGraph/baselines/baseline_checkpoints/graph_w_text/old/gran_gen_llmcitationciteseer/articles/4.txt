Deep neural ranking models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but they often rely on manual feature engineering and query formulation. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'NeuroExpand', which leverages the semantic relationships learned by a pre-trained language model to generate context-aware query expansions. We demonstrate that NeuroExpand can significantly improve the retrieval effectiveness of neural ranking models, especially for complex and ambiguous queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods and achieves competitive performance with manual query formulation.
