Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to enhance the query representation by incorporating relevant terms. This paper proposes a novel graph-based QE approach, dubbed GraphEmb, which leverages semantic embeddings to model the relationships between query terms and expand the query effectively. By constructing a knowledge graph from a large-scale corpus, GraphEmb captures nuanced semantic relationships and identifies informative expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphEmb outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
