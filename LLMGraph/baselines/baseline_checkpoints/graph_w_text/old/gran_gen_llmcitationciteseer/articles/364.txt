People with dysarthria, a speech disorder characterized by slow and effortful speech, often face difficulties interacting with voice assistants. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the needs of individuals with dysarthria. We conducted interviews and co-design workshops to identify the specific challenges and requirements of this population. Our proposed system, 'EasySpeak', incorporates novel speech recognition techniques, adaptive dialogue management, and personalized feedback mechanisms to accommodate the unique characteristics of dysarthric speech. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in interaction success and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
