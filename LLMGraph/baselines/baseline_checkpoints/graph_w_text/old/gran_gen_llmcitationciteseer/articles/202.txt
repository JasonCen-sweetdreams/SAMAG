Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental task in information retrieval. Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component, as it can significantly impact retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'NeuroExpander', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic query representations. By combining a transformer-based architecture with a relevance-based ranking loss, NeuroExpander generates high-quality expansion terms that improve retrieval effectiveness. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExpander outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant gains in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
