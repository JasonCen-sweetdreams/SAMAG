Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have gained popularity due to their scalability and ease of use. However, multi-tenancy introduces significant query optimization challenges. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'TenantAware', which leverages machine learning-based tenant profiling and workload clustering to improve query performance. We propose a two-phase optimization approach that incorporates tenant-specific indexing and dynamic query rewriting. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate up to 3x improvement in query response time and 2x reduction in resource utilization compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
