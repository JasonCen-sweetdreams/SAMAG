Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating inclusive VR experiences tailored to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study, involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing, to identify key design considerations and challenges. Our findings inform the development of a novel VR framework that incorporates cognitive support tools, intuitive interfaces, and personalized adaptivity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study on a VR-based reminiscence therapy application.
