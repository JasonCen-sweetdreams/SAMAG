Passage retrieval is a critical component of ad-hoc search, but existing methods suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. We propose a novel hierarchical document representation framework, 'HDPR', which leverages a tree-structured neural network to encode documents at multiple granularities. By indexing and retrieving passages at the sentence and paragraph levels, HDPR reduces the search space and enables efficient filtering of irrelevant documents. Experimental results on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and query latency compared to state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods.
