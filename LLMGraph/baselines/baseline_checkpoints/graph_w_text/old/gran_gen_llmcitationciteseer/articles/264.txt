Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities and strengths need to be assigned to tasks to optimize system performance. This paper proposes a novel graph neural network (GNN) framework, 'AgentGNN', to efficiently allocate tasks in large-scale multi-agent systems. AgentGNN leverages the graph structure of the agent-task interaction network to learn a scalable and adaptive task allocation policy. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that AgentGNN outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in terms of assignment quality, computational efficiency, and robustness to agent failures.
