Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a promising platform for emotional expression and social interaction. This paper explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing emotional expression in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, who were tasked with conveying emotions through virtual gestures and facial expressions. Our results show that personalized avatars, generated using machine learning-based facial recognition, significantly increase the accuracy of emotional expression recognition by human observers. We also found that participants reported higher levels of emotional comfort and engagement when interacting with personalized avatars. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based emotional intelligence training systems and social skills therapy platforms.
