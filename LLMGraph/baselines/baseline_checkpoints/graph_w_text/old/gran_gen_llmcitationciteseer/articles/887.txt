The rapid growth of multidimensional data has necessitated the development of efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HierIndex', which leverages the inherent structure of multidimensional data to accelerate query processing. By recursively partitioning the data space into smaller regions, HierIndex reduces the number of disk accesses and improves query response times. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, achieving up to 50% reduction in query latency compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
