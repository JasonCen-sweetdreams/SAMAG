This paper presents a novel framework for autonomous negotiation in multi-agent systems (MAS) operating in dynamic environments. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach, where agents learn to negotiate through a combination of high-level strategy selection and low-level action planning. Our approach adapts to changing environmental conditions by incorporating online learning and opponent modeling. Experimental results in a simulated resource allocation domain demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional negotiation strategies in terms of negotiation success rate, fairness, and adaptability.
