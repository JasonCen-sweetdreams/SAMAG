This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent system for real-time traffic signal control, enabling adaptive traffic management in complex urban networks. Our framework leverages a hybrid approach combining model-free reinforcement learning and model-based optimization, allowing agents to learn from local observations and negotiate with neighboring agents to optimize traffic flow. Simulation results on a realistic traffic network demonstrate significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional fixed-time signal control strategies.
