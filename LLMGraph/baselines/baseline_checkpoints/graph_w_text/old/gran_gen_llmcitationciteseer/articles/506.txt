Column-oriented NoSQL databases have gained popularity in big data analytics, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to select the most efficient query plan. We introduce a column-wise selectivity estimation method that accurately predicts data distribution and reduces the number of required scans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColOpt outperforms existing optimization techniques by up to 3.5x in query execution time, while maintaining a low overhead.
