Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics. However, optimizing query execution plans in DDS remains a challenging task due to the complex interactions between nodes and the dynamic nature of data distribution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that the RL-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
