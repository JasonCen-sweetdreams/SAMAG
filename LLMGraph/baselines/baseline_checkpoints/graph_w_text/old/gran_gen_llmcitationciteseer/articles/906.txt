Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including healthcare, finance, and IoT. Despite advances in deep learning-based methods, explainability remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for time-series anomaly detection. Our approach leverages multi-scale temporal attention mechanisms to identify salient features andRelations between them, enabling interpretable anomaly detection. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while providing insightful explanations for the detected anomalies.
