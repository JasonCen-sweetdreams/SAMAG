 Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it significantly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on execution time and resource utilization. Our approach, called 'RL-Optimizer', leverages a combination of exploration-exploitation strategies and deep Q-networks to adapt to changing workloads and system conditions. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
