Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants, have become increasingly prevalent, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains limited. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive conversational interface, 'EasyTalk', tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies to identify key design recommendations, including simplifying language, providing memory aids, and incorporating emotional support. Our results show that EasyTalk significantly improves the conversational experience and task completion rates for older adults with cognitive impairments, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in HCI.
