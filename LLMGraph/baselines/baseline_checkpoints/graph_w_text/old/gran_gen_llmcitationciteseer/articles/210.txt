This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to enhance learning outcomes. We designed a gesture-based interface that leverages users' bodily experiences to facilitate deeper understanding of complex concepts. In a user study, we compared the interface with traditional keyboard-and-mouse interactions and found significant improvements in knowledge retention and recall. Our results suggest that embodied cognition can be successfully integrated into VR-based educational systems, and we discuss implications for the design of future learning environments.
