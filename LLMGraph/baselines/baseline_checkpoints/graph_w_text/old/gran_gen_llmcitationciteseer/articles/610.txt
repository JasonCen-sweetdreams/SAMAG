Personalization has become a cornerstone of modern user experience design. However, its effects on user experience in immersive virtual reality (VR) environments remain understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study that examines the impact of personalized interactions on user engagement, enjoyment, and cognitive load in VR. Our results show that personalized VR experiences lead to increased user satisfaction and reduced cognitive load, but also raise concerns about information overload and user agency. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of personalized VR systems and highlight areas for future research.
