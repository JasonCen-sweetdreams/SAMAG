In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize agent assignments. Our approach, called 'DTRLA', uses a hierarchical graph neural network to model agent capabilities and task dependencies, and a multi-agent Q-network to learn cooperative policies. We evaluate DTRLA in a simulated logistics domain and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced latency compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
