Efficient passage retrieval is a crucial component of modern search engines, but existing methods often rely on cumbersome document representations that compromise query latency. This paper presents a novel query-focused document embedding framework, 'QFDE', which learns to project documents into a query-aware semantic space. By incorporating a query-document attention mechanism, QFDE enables fast and accurate passage ranking while reducing the dimensionality of document representations. Experimental results on the TREC CAR dataset demonstrate that QFDE outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods in terms of both retrieval accuracy and query response time.
