Document clustering is a crucial task in information retrieval, but traditional methods often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Latent Semantic Analysis (HLSA), which leverages the hierarchical structure of document collections to improve clustering efficiency. HLSA combines a fast, sparse matrix factorization with a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm, enabling the discovery of meaningful document clusters at multiple resolutions. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HLSA over state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality, runtime, and scalability.
