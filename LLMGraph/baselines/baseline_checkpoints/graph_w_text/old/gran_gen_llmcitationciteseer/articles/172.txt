Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify sentiment polarities towards specific aspects or entities in text. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach, 'SemGraph', which leverages semantic relationships between aspects, entities, and sentiments. We propose a multi-layer graph neural network (GNN) to capture complex interactions between nodes, enabling the model to disentangle sentiment towards multiple aspects. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in aspect-level sentiment accuracy and aspect-sentiment pair extraction over state-of-the-art methods.
