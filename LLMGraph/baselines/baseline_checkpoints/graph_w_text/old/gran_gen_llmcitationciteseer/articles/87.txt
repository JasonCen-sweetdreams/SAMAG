Virtual Reality (VR) systems have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but existing interfaces often rely on cumbersome controllers or gaze-only interactions. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction framework that combines gaze, voice, and gesture inputs to enable more natural and intuitive user interactions in VR. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a user study, which shows significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. Our framework has implications for a wide range of VR applications, from gaming to education and healthcare.
