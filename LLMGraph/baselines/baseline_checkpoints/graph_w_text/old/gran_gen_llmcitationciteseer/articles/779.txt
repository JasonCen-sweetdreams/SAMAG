Virtual reality (VR) systems have the potential to revolutionize assistive technology, but current gesture recognition systems often fail to accommodate users with disabilities. This paper presents 'AdaptiGest', a novel framework that leverages machine learning and user modeling to adapt gesture recognition to individual users' abilities and preferences. Our approach integrates real-time user feedback, personalized gesture recognition, and adaptive difficulty adjustment to facilitate more inclusive and accessible VR experiences. Experimental results with 30 participants demonstrate significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction for users with motor impairments.
