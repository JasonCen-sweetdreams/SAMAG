Main-memory column-stores have become popular for analytical workloads, but indexing high-dimensional data remains a challenge. This paper presents 'HDIndex', a novel indexing technique that exploits the inherent sparsity of high-dimensional data to reduce storage overhead and improve query performance. HDIndex uses a combination of bit-vector compression and hierarchical clustering to efficiently support range and k-NN queries. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that HDIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query performance and 2x in storage efficiency.
