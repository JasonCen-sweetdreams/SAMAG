Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to scale and handle large volumes of data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. Our approach, called QOpt-RL, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database's workload and system dynamics. Experimental results show that QOpt-RL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average reduction of 30% in query execution time and 25% in resource utilization.
