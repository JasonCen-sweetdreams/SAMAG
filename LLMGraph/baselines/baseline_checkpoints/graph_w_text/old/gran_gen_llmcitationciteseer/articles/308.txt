Time-series forecasting models have become increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can have devastating consequences in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel approach to enhance the robustness of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for time-series forecasting. We develop a graph-based adversarial training framework that incorporates both temporal and spatial dependencies in the data. Our approach significantly improves the robustness of GCNs against various types of attacks, including gradient-based and optimization-based attacks. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in maintaining accurate predictions under adversarial conditions.
