Few-shot image classification tasks require models to adapt to new classes with limited training samples. This paper proposes a novel deep Bayesian meta-learning approach, 'BayesMAML', which leverages probabilistic embeddings and hierarchical variational inference to learn adaptable representations. We demonstrate that BayesMAML outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving higher accuracy and uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing meta-learning frameworks, enabling flexible and robust few-shot learning.
