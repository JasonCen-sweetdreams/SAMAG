Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in daily life, but their design often neglects the needs of diverse user populations. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining the user experience of individuals with disabilities and older adults when interacting with voice assistants. Our findings highlight the importance of emotional intelligence in voice assistants, as users perceive empathetic responses as more trustworthy and engaging. We propose a novel framework, 'EmpathyLens', which incorporates affective computing and inclusive design principles to develop more empathetic voice assistants. A prototype evaluation demonstrates improved user satisfaction and reduced frustration among participants.
