This paper presents a novel approach to real-time human-object interaction detection in videos using graph-based attention networks. Our framework, called GOAT, models the relationships between humans and objects as a graph and applies attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GOAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in detection accuracy and speed. Furthermore, we show that GOAT can be easily integrated into various applications, such as surveillance systems and human-robot collaboration platforms.
