Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed environments. Our proposed framework, 'RL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given workload. We evaluate RL-QO on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional optimization techniques. Our results show that RL-QO can reduce query latency by up to 30% and improve system throughput by up to 25%.
