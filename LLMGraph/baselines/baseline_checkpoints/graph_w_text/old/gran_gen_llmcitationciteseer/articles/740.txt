Coordinating multiple agents in complex environments remains a challenging task in multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to learn both individual and team-level policies. Our approach, called HRL-MA, introduces a higher-level coordinator that guides the learning process of lower-level agents, promoting cooperation and improving overall system performance. We evaluate HRL-MA in a realistic logistics scenario, demonstrating improved delivery efficiency and reduced conflicts compared to existing decentralized approaches.
