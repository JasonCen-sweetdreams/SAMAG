Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience and encouraging sustained participation in VR environments. We designed and implemented an avatar customization system that leverages machine learning-based facial recognition and anthropometric analysis. Our user study with 120 participants reveals that personalized avatars lead to increased user satisfaction, reduced cybersickness, and improved task performance. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems and highlight avenues for future research.
