Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs, such as speech, text, and vision, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features for emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of a multi-modal fusion layer, modality-specific attention modules, and a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global contextual information. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal inputs.
