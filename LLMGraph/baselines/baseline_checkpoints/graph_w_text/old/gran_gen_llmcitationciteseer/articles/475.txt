The rapid growth of digital content has led to an increase in the complexity of search queries, making traditional retrieval methods inefficient. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical re-ranking approach, 'HiRe', which leverages semantic relationships between query terms and document entities to improve retrieval efficiency. HiRe utilizes a graph-based neural network to learn contextualized representations of query-document pairs, enabling effective re-ranking of top-k documents. Experimentation on the TREC-2020 dataset demonstrates a significant reduction in latency and a 15% increase in retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
