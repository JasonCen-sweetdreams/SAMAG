Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in information retrieval, where the goal is to identify the correct entity mention in a document. Traditional approaches rely on hand-crafted features and rely heavily on domain expertise. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) framework for entity disambiguation, which learns to represent documents as graphs and captures complex contextual relationships between entities. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant entities and modalities, resulting in improved ranking performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
