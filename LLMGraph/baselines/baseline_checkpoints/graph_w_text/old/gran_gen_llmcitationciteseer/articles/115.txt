Materialized views (MVs) are widely used in distributed database systems to improve query performance. However, maintaining MVs in the presence of frequent data updates is a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel maintenance algorithm, 'MV-Fresh', which leverages incremental view maintenance and adaptive sampling to minimize the refresh latency and overhead. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that dynamically adjusts the maintenance frequency and sampling rate based on the update workload and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that MV-Fresh reduces the average refresh time by up to 60% compared to existing solutions.
