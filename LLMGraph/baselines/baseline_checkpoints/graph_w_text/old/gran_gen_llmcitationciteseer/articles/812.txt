Big data analytics has become a crucial aspect of various industries, but optimizing complex queries remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design a RL framework that learns to optimize query plans based on a reward function that balances execution time and resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
