Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a crucial component in various AI applications, but extracting relevant relations between entities remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) for relation extraction in KGs. HGAT leverages a hierarchical graph structure to model complex relations and incorporates attention mechanisms to focus on relevant entities and relations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrating its effectiveness in extracting meaningful relations from large-scale KGs.
