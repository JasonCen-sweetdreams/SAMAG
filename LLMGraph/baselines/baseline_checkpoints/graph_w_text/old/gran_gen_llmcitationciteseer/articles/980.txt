This paper addresses the problem of resource allocation in distributed systems, where autonomous agents must collaborate to optimize system performance. We propose a decentralized coordination mechanism, 'AgentCoord', which leverages a combination of game-theoretic and machine learning techniques to enable agents to negotiate and allocate resources efficiently. Our approach considers both local and global constraints, ensuring that individual agent objectives are aligned with system-level goals. Experimental results on a simulated distributed computing platform demonstrate that AgentCoord outperforms existing decentralized approaches, achieving up to 30% improvement in system throughput and 25% reduction in resource waste.
