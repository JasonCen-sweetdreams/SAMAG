In multi-agent systems, agents often hold conflicting beliefs about the environment. This paper presents a novel approach to distributed belief revision using argumentation theory. Our framework, ARG-REV, enables agents to engage in local argumentation-based dialogues to revise their beliefs in response to new information. We formally define the semantics of ARG-REV and prove its correctness and completeness. Experimental results on a simulated robot soccer domain demonstrate the effectiveness of ARG-REV in achieving consensus among agents with minimal communication overhead.
