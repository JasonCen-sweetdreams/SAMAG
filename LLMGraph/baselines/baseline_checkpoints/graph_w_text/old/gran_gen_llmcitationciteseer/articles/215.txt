In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving complex goals. However, current approaches often rely on centralized controllers or suffer from scalability issues. This paper presents a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, called 'HRL-MAS', that enables decentralized coordination among agents. HRL-MAS combines high-level task planning with low-level action execution, allowing agents to adapt to changing environments and learn from experience. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that HRL-MAS outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
