Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component in modern data analytics, but it poses significant scalability challenges. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'RT-Index', designed to accelerate query performance in real-time data warehousing systems. RT-Index leverages a combination of bitmap indexing and zone-based partitioning to minimize storage overhead while maintaining query efficiency. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that RT-Index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage efficiency.
