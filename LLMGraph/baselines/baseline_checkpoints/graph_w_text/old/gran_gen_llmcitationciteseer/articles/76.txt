This paper addresses the problem of cooperative task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities and constraints need to work together to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies. Our method, called GraphTask, integrates GNNs with a distributed constraint optimization framework to efficiently allocate tasks to agents while satisfying global constraints. Experimental results on a variety of scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphTask in improving system performance and scalability compared to existing methods.
