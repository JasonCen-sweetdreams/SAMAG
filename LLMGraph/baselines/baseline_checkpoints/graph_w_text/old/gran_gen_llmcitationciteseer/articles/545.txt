Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for scalable data processing, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, called 'RL-QO', learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database system. We introduce a custom RL environment that simulates distributed query execution and a reward function that balances query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate that RL-QO outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource efficiency.
