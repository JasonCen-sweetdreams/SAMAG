Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize learning experiences, but its effectiveness remains unclear. This study investigates the role of embodied cognition in VR-based learning environments, exploring how bodily interactions influence cognitive processes. We designed a VR platform that incorporates gestural interfaces and haptic feedback, and conducted a user study with 60 participants. Results show that embodied cognition significantly enhances learning outcomes, particularly for spatial reasoning and problem-solving tasks. We discuss implications for the design of VR-based educational systems and highlight future research directions.
