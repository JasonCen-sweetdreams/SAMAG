Neural ranking models have become increasingly popular in information retrieval tasks, but they often suffer from slow inference speeds and high computational costs. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HiRank', which leverages a multi-level document representation to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. Our approach first employs a lightweight neural network to filter out irrelevant documents, and then applies a more accurate but computationally expensive ranking model to the remaining candidates. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiRank achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while reducing inference time by up to 60% compared to existing neural ranking models.
