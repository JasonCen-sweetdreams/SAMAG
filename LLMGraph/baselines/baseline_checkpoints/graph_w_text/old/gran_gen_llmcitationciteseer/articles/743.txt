Time series anomaly detection has numerous applications in domains like finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explanations for its predictions. Our HAN model consists of a hierarchical encoder that captures long-term dependencies and a attention-based decoder that generates anomaly scores and explanations. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and interpretability.
