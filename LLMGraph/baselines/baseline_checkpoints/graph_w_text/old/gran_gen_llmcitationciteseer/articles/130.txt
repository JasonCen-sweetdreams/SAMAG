Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its benefits are largely inaccessible to users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. We conducted a series of user studies to identify the key challenges and opportunities in VR accessibility and developed a set of guidelines for designers and developers. Our framework integrates tactile, auditory, and haptic feedback to provide an immersive and engaging experience for users with visual impairments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study on a VR-based museum tour, and discuss the broader implications for inclusive design in HCI.
