As augmented reality (AR) devices become ubiquitous, securing user authentication has become a pressing concern. This paper proposes a novel gaze-based implicit authentication approach for AR devices, leveraging the unique affordances of eye-tracking technology. Our system, 'Gaze-ID', uses machine learning to classify users based on their gaze patterns, eliminating the need for explicit authentication mechanisms. We evaluate Gaze-ID on a dataset of 100 users, demonstrating an equal error rate of 2.5% and outperforming state-of-the-art implicit authentication methods. Our approach enables seamless, convenient, and secure authentication for AR applications.
