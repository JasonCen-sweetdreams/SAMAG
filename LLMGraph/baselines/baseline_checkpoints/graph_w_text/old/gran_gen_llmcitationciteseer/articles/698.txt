Neural ranking models have shown promising results in ad-hoc document retrieval, but their high computational cost hinders their adoption in real-world applications. This paper proposes an early fusion approach that combines the strengths of different neural ranking models to improve retrieval efficiency. We introduce a novel technique for selectively fusing the output of multiple models based on their confidence estimates, resulting in a significant reduction in computational overhead. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving a better trade-off between retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
