Cooperative exploration in multi-agent systems can be severely hindered by partial observability and limited communication bandwidth. This paper presents a novel framework, 'AdCoEx', which enables agents to adaptively adjust their communication strategies based on the environment's observability. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that focuses on relevant observations and a softmax-based communication policy that balances information sharing and bandwidth constraints. Experimental results in grid-world and drone-based scenarios demonstrate that AdCoEx outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of exploration efficiency and communication cost.
