Knowledge graphs have become increasingly popular for organizing and querying complex data. However, querying large knowledge graphs can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HiQE', which leverages the hierarchical structure of domain-specific knowledge graphs to efficiently retrieve relevant information. HiQE adaptively expands user queries based on the semantic relevance of entities and their relationships, reducing the search space and improving query efficiency. Experiments on real-world knowledge graphs demonstrate that HiQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and query response time.
