Modern applications increasingly rely on dynamic database schemas, which pose significant challenges to query optimization. This paper introduces DynaIndex, a novel adaptive indexing technique that leverages machine learning to predict query patterns and optimize index creation. DynaIndex utilizes a graph neural network to learn the structural dependencies between schema elements and adapts to changes in the schema and query workload. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that DynaIndex achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance and 2x reduction in indexing overhead compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
