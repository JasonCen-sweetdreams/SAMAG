Ad-hoc search systems struggle to retrieve relevant documents when queries are short or ambiguous. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, 'QDE', which selectively incorporates relevant sentences from top-retrieved documents to augment the original query. We employ a neural sentence encoder to capture semantic relationships between query terms and document sentences. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc search benchmark demonstrate that QDE significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short queries, and outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
