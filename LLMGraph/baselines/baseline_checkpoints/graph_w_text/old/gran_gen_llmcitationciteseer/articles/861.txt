Multi-tenant database systems (MTDS) have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, where multiple tenants share the same database instance. However, query optimization in MTDS is challenging due to the dynamic and unpredictable workloads of each tenant. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query performance in MTDS. We develop a query optimizer that uses historical query patterns and resource utilization data to predict the optimal query plan for each tenant. Our experiments on a real-world MTDS workload show that our approach reduces query latency by up to 35% and improves resource utilization by up to 20% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
