Urban traffic congestion poses significant economic and environmental challenges. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent system that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize traffic signal control and route planning in real-time. Our approach, 'Traffic Harmony', integrates autonomous agents representing traffic signals and vehicles, which learn to coordinate their actions to minimize travel times, reduce congestion, and prioritize emergency vehicles. We evaluate Traffic Harmony using a large-scale simulation of the San Francisco traffic network, demonstrating a 25% reduction in travel times and a 30% decrease in congestion compared to traditional traffic management strategies.
