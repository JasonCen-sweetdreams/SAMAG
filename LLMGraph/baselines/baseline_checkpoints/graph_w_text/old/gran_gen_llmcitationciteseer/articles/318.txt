Explainability is crucial in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to understand decision-making processes and build trust. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for explainable MARL. HAN incorporates attention mechanisms at both the agent and team levels, enabling the identification of key factors influencing agent decisions and team coordination. We evaluate HAN on a real-world traffic simulation environment and demonstrate improved explainability and coordination compared to state-of-the-art MARL methods.
