Gesture recognition systems have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with motor impairments. However, existing systems often fail to account for the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating accessible gesture recognition systems, incorporating input from older adults with motor impairments and care providers. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach through a usability study, demonstrating improved recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and effective gesture recognition systems for this underserved population.
