Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in smart homes, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyVoice', a novel voice assistant interface tailored to the needs of older adults with mild cognitive impairments. Our approach incorporates simplification of voice commands, audio and visual feedback, and personalized prompts to facilitate error recovery. A user study with 20 participants shows that EasyVoice significantly improves task completion rates and reduces frustration compared to commercial voice assistants.
