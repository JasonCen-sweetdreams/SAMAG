Traditional query expansion techniques for information retrieval rely on static term associations, neglecting the contextual nuances of user queries. This paper proposes a neural approach, 'NQE-CA', which integrates contextualized embeddings and graph-based attention to capture query intent. Our method learns to adaptively expand queries based on the semantic relationships between terms, entities, and user preferences. Experimental evaluations on the TREC-NEWS dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for ambiguous and under-specified queries.
