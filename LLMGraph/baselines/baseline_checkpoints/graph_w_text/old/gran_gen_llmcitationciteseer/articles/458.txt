Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data analysis. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results, they often suffer from over-smoothing and lack of attention to node importance. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) that leverages a multi-level attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and their neighbors. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in node classification tasks, especially for nodes with limited connections.
