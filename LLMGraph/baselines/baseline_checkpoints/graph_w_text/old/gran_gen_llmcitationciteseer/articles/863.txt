Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query execution plans. We develop a deep reinforcement learning model that learns to predict optimal query plans based on historical query patterns and database statistics. Our experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
