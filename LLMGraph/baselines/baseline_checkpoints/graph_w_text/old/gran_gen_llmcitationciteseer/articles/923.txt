Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the quality of search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep contextualized embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. We introduce a neural network-based model that learns to generate query expansions by predicting relevant context words. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly for complex queries. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of our method in various retrieval scenarios.
