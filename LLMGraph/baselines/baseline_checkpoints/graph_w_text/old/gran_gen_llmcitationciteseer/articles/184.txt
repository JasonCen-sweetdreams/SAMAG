Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, 'RL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan from a set of possible plans. We evaluate RL-QO on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time compared to traditional optimization techniques. Furthermore, we show that RL-QO adapts well to changing database workloads and query patterns.
