Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments often face uncertainty and conflicting goals. This paper presents an adaptive negotiation framework for autonomous agents that integrates machine learning and game theory techniques. Our approach enables agents to learn from experience and adapt their negotiation strategies in response to changing environmental conditions and opponent behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional negotiation strategies in terms of Pareto optimality and convergence rate in scenarios involving multiple conflicting goals and uncertain outcomes.
