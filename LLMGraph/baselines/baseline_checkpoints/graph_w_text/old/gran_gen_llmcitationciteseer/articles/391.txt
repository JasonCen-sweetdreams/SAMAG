This paper explores the role of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in promoting emotional intelligence and patient engagement in healthcare settings. We designed and evaluated an ECA system, 'Empathica', which leverages multimodal sensing and machine learning to recognize and respond to patients' emotional cues. Our user study involving 60 patients with chronic illnesses demonstrates that Empathica increases patient trust, satisfaction, and self-efficacy compared to traditional human-agent interactions. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development of socially intelligent ECAs that can facilitate more empathetic and inclusive healthcare experiences.
