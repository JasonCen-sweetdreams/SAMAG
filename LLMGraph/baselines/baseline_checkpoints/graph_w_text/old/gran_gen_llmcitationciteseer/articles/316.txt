Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have gained popularity for their scalability and ease of use. However, optimizing query performance in multi-tenant environments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'QTune', that leverages machine learning and graph-based models to predict and mitigate query contention. We develop a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group queries based on their resource usage patterns and propose a dynamic query scheduling strategy that adapts to changing workload conditions. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate that QTune reduces query latency by up to 35% and improves overall system throughput by 25%.
