Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to support older adults in daily living tasks, but their effectiveness hinges on intelligibility. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create ECAs that are more comprehensible and engaging for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, aged 65-85, to identify key factors influencing ECA intelligibility. Our findings inform the development of a novel ECA framework, 'ElderChat', which incorporates Age-related Cognitive Compensation Theory and embodied cognition principles. We demonstrate ElderChat's efficacy in enhancing older adults' comprehension and trust in ECAs through a usability study.
