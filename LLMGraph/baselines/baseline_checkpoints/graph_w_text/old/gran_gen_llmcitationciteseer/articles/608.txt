Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural semantic embeddings to better represent the semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, called 'NSE-QE', uses a deep learning model to learn dense vector representations of words and phrases, which are then used to generate expanded queries that better capture the underlying intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that NSE-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
