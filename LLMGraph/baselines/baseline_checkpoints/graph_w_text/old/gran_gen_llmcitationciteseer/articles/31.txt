Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between users and documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages deep neural word embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. Our approach, dubbed 'EmbedExpan', integrates a pre-trained language model with a relevance-based feedback mechanism to generate high-quality expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmbedExpan outperforms traditional query expansion methods, leading to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
