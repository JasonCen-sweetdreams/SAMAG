In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Our approach, 'MA-RL-TA', uses a decentralized actor-critic architecture to learn task allocation policies that maximize system-level rewards while minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results on a simulated multi-robot system demonstrate that MA-RL-TA outperforms traditional centralized and distributed task allocation approaches in terms of task completion time and system efficiency.
