Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) model that integrates item features, user preferences, and knowledge graph information to generate personalized explanations. Our approach leverages a multi-level attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant items, users, and knowledge graph entities. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
