Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous in modern technology, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to create inclusive conversational interfaces that accommodate the needs of this demographic. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our findings highlight the importance of simplifying language, using visual cues, and providing error forgiveness mechanisms. We implemented these design principles in a conversational chatbot and evaluated its usability with a cohort of older adults with cognitive impairments. Results show significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
