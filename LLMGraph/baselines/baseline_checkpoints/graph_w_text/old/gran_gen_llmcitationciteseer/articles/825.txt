Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in knowledge graph construction, but existing methods suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large datasets. We propose a novel approach that combines graph-based clustering with incremental indexing to efficiently disambiguate entities. Our method, called 'GEDII', leverages the structural properties of knowledge graphs to identify densely connected clusters of entities, and then employs an incremental indexing scheme to reduce the computational cost of similarity computations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GEDII outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
