Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the database schema and query plans as graphs and employ GNNs to learn efficient query execution strategies. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and reduces energy consumption by up to 25%.
