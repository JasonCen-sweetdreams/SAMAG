Entity retrieval in knowledge graphs (KGs) often relies on query expansion to improve retrieval effectiveness. However, existing methods can be computationally expensive and may not fully utilize KG semantics. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'KG-EXPAND', which leverages KG entity relationships and type information to generate high-quality expansion terms. We introduce a hierarchical clustering approach to group semantically similar entities and a scoring function that balances entity relevance and diversity. Experimental results on DBpedia and YAGO KG datasets demonstrate that KG-EXPAND outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and reduces computational overhead by up to 40%.
