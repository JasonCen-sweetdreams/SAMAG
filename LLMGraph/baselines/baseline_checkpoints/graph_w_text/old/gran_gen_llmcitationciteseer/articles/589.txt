Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize accessibility for users with visual impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often rely on visual cues, creating barriers for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework, 'InclusiveVR', which leverages auditory and haptic feedback to enable users with visual impairments to interact with virtual environments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating that InclusiveVR significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our findings inform the development of accessible VR systems that can benefit a broader range of users.
