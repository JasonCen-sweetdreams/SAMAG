Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of DDS architectures. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using machine learning (ML) techniques. We develop a framework, 'QueryOpt', that leverages historical query data and system metrics to predict optimal query execution plans. Our experiments on a real-world DDS benchmark show that QueryOpt outperforms traditional rule-based optimization methods by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
