The increasing scale and complexity of modern database systems necessitate efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages graph-based models to optimize query execution in distributed database systems. We propose a method that represents the database schema as a graph and uses graph neural networks to learn query execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time, while also reducing the number of transferred data packets by 25%
