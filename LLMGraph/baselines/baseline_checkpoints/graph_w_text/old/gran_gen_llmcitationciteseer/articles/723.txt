Distributed column-store databases have become increasingly popular for big data analytics, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning to learn efficient execution plans. We propose a Deep Q-Network (DQN) based framework that takes into account various database statistics, query characteristics, and system resources to generate optimized query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
