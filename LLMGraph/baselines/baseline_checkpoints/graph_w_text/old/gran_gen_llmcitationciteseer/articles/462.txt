Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to scale and handle large volumes of data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database workload and system configuration. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
