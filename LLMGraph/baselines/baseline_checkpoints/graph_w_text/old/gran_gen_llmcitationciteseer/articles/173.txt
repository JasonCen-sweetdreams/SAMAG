Few-shot node classification on graph-structured data is a challenging task, especially when dealing with limited labeled instances. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant subgraphs and nodes. By hierarchically aggregating node representations, HGAT learns to generalize well to unseen classes with only a few examples. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving classification accuracy and robustness to varying graph structures.
