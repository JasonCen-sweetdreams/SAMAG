Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in information retrieval, but current approaches struggle to scale to large knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a novel method, 'KG-EmbedRank', which combines knowledge graph embeddings with neural ranking models to disambiguate entities. We leverage graph attention mechanisms to capture entity relationships and incorporate a ranking loss function to optimize entity selection. Experimental results on the Wikidata5M dataset demonstrate that KG-EmbedRank outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, achieving a 23% improvement in disambiguation accuracy on a dataset of 1 million entities.
