Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance for multiple tenants remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for multi-tenant databases. Our approach, called 'MT-RL', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for each tenant, taking into account the dynamic workload and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that MT-RL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of average query response time, while ensuring fairness and resource efficiency across tenants.
