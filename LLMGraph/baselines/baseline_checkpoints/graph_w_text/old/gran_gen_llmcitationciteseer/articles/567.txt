Real-time data warehousing poses significant query optimization challenges due to the high volume and velocity of data. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using machine learning techniques. We develop a framework that leverages query workload patterns and data distribution characteristics to predict optimal query execution plans. Our approach is evaluated using a real-world dataset and shows improved query performance and reduced latency compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
