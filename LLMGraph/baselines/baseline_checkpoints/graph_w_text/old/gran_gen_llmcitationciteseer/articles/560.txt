As the volume and velocity of data continue to increase, distributed database systems (DDS) have become a crucial component of modern data infrastructure. However, query optimization in DDS remains a significant challenge due to the complexities of data distribution, node heterogeneity, and dynamic workload patterns. We propose a novel query optimization framework, 'AdaOpt', which leverages machine learning-based models to adaptively learn query patterns and optimize query plans in real-time. Our experiments on a large-scale DDS setup demonstrate that AdaOpt achieves up to 3x improvement in query response time and 2x reduction in resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
