The proliferation of WebXR has opened up new opportunities for augmented reality (AR) experiences to reach a broader audience. However, the interaction modalities employed in these experiences often neglect the embodied and situated nature of human cognition. This paper revisits the concept of affordance-based interaction, which leverages the user's inherent understanding of real-world objects to facilitate intuitive AR interactions. We present a novel framework, 'AffordXR', that integrates affordance-based interaction with WebXR, enabling developers to create more immersive and user-friendly AR experiences. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrates the effectiveness of AffordXR in improving user engagement and reducing cognitive load.
