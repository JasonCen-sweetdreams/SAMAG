Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize interaction and engagement, but users with visual impairments face significant barriers to access. This paper presents a novel VR interface design framework, 'VR-Access', which incorporates auditory and haptic feedback to enable users with visual impairments to navigate and interact with virtual environments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating that VR-Access improves navigation efficiency and reduces cognitive load compared to traditional audio-only interfaces. Our findings inform the development of inclusive VR systems that promote equal access for users with disabilities.
