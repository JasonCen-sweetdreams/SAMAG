In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework, 'GNN-TA', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn agent-agent and agent-task relationships. Our approach enables agents to dynamically adjust their task assignments based on real-time communication with neighboring agents, resulting in improved system-level performance and adaptability. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-TA in reducing task completion time and increasing overall system efficiency.
