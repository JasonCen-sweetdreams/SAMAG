In decentralized multi-agent systems, allocating tasks efficiently is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation for heterogeneous autonomous agents using multi-objective optimization. We formulate the task allocation problem as a bi-objective optimization problem, considering both task completion time and agent utilization. We propose a decentralized optimization algorithm that leverages the Agents' local knowledge and iteratively updates task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization, while maintaining scalability and robustness.
