Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph data and the distributed architecture. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph decomposition, subquery caching, and adaptive join ordering to improve query performance. Our experiments on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms existing optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and 2x in terms of memory usage.
