Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed graph databases. Our method, called GraphRL, learns to select the most efficient query plan based on the graph structure, query patterns, and system workload. We evaluate GraphRL on a real-world graph dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and system throughput compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
