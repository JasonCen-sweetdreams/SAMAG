Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) to improve the recall of relevant documents. However, traditional methods often suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, especially in specialized domains. This paper proposes a hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-Specialist', which leverages domain-specific ontologies to generate a hierarchical representation of query concepts. We demonstrate that HQE-Specialist outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods on three benchmark datasets from the medical and legal domains, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
