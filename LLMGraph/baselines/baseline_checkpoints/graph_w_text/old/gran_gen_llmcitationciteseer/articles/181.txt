In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving system-level objectives. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, 'CATALYST', that enables coordinated task allocation among agents in complex, dynamic environments. CATALYST leverages a decentralized, actor-critic architecture to learn effective task assignment policies, while incorporating domain knowledge through expert-designed reward functions. Experimental results demonstrate that CATALYST outperforms traditional optimization methods and existing learning-based approaches in simulated disaster response and logistics scenarios.
