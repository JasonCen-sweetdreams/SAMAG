Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, as graph sizes continue to grow, traditional indexing methods struggle to maintain query performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, GraphRIndex, which leverages a combination of graph partitioning, Bloom filters, and parallel query processing to achieve scalable query execution. Our experiments on large-scale graph datasets demonstrate significant improvements in query latency and throughput compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods.
