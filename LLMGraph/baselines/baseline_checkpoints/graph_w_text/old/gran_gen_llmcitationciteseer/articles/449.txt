In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Our approach, called GraphTask, learns to optimize task assignments in a distributed manner, without relying on a centralized controller. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphTask in various synthetic and real-world scenarios, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional methods.
