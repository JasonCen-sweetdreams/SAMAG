Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel query expansion framework, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to selectively add terms to the original query. Our approach uses a neural network to learn a reward function that balances the trade-off between query relevance and term importance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and TREC-2004 datasets demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving an average precision improvement of 15.2% and 11.5%, respectively.
