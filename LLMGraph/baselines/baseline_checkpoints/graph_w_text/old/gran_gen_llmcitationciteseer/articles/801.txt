Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent from short queries. Query expansion (QE) is a popular technique to address this issue, but existing methods rely on hand-crafted rules or limited semantic knowledge. This paper proposes a novel QE approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal query expansion strategies. Our model, 'RL-QE', uses a Markov decision process to select expansion terms that maximize the expected retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
