Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has shown promising results in open-domain question answering, but its computational cost hinders its adoption in real-world applications. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural DPR model, HN-DPR, which reduces the retrieval time by up to 70% while maintaining the retrieval quality. HN-DPR uses a novel hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant passages, pruning the search space and reducing the number of embeddings that need to be computed. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HN-DPR in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.
