In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient allocation of tasks to agents to achieve global objectives. This paper proposes a novel approach to cooperative task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and develop a multi-agent deep Q-network (DQN) to learn the optimal allocation policy. Our approach enables agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization-based methods and achieves near-optimal performance in various task allocation scenarios.
