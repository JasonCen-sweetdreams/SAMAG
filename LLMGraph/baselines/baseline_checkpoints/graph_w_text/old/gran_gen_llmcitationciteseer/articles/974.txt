Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as facial expressions, speech, and physiological signals, is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features at multiple scales. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers, followed by a cross-modal attention layer that integrates the modality-wise representations. Experimental results on the benchmark EMOTIC dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal data, particularly in scenarios with incomplete or noisy data.
