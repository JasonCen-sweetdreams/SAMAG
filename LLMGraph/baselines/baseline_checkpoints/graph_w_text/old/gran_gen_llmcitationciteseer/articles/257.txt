Voice assistants have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but older adults often struggle to use them effectively. This paper presents a novel gamification approach to improve the accessibility and usability of voice assistants for older adults. We designed a voice-based game, 'VoiceQuest', that simulates real-world scenarios and provides personalized feedback and rewards to encourage users to practice voice commands. A user study with 30 older adults showed significant improvements in voice assistant usage confidence and accuracy, as well as increased user engagement and satisfaction. Our findings have implications for designing more inclusive and supportive voice assistants for diverse user populations.
