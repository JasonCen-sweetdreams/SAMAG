Distributed graph databases are increasingly used in modern applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph data and distributed systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to navigate the vast space of possible query plans and identifies the most efficient one. Our approach, GraphRL, leverages a deep Q-network to learn from a large dataset of query executions and adapts to changing system conditions. Experiments on a real-world graph database show that GraphRL achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimizers, with an average speedup of 3.2x.
