Open-domain question answering (ODQA) models often struggle with queries that lack contextual information. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'ConEx', which leverages contextualized embeddings to capture the nuances of user queries. ConEx integrates a graph-based attention mechanism to selectively incorporate relevant domain knowledge, enabling more effective query expansion. Experimental results on the SQuAD dataset demonstrate that ConEx significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ODQA models in terms of F1-score and ROUGE-L metrics.
