Query optimization is a crucial step in ensuring efficient data retrieval in distributed database systems. Traditional approaches rely on rule-based or cost-based optimization, which can be suboptimal in complex scenarios. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to query optimization, where an agent learns to select the optimal query plan by interacting with the database environment. We propose a novel framework, 'RL-Opt', which leverages a combination of exploration strategies and reward functions to adapt to changing workload patterns. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
