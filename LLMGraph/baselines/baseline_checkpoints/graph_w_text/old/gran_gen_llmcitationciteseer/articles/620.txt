With the increasing volume and velocity of data, traditional indexing techniques are struggling to keep up with the demands of real-time data warehousing. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, Adaptive Bitmap Compression (ABC), that leverages the sparsity of data to achieve significant storage and query performance improvements. ABC adaptively adjusts the compression ratio based on data distribution, resulting in up to 50% reduction in storage requirements and 30% improvement in query response time compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques. We evaluate ABC on a real-world IoT dataset and demonstrate its scalability and efficiency in supporting real-time analytics.
