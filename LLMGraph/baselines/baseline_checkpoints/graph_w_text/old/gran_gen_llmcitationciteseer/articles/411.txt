Traditional ranking models in information retrieval (IR) often suffer from limited contextual understanding of user queries. This paper presents a novel neural re-ranking approach that incorporates context-aware features to improve document ranking. Our proposed model, ContextRank, leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to weigh the importance of query terms, entities, and semantic roles in the document. Experimental results on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate that ContextRank significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, achieving a 12.5% increase in mean average precision.
