Explainability is crucial in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to ensure transparency and trust in decision-making. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework that integrates attention mechanisms at two levels: agent-level and system-level. The agent-level attention enables each agent to focus on relevant observations and actions, while the system-level attention facilitates communication and cooperation among agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in three MARL benchmarks, showing improved performance and interpretable decision-making policies.
