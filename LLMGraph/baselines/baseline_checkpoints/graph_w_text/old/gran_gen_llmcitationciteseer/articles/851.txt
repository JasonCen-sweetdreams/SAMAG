The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in smart grids necessitates efficient resource allocation to ensure reliability and stability. This paper presents a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DECPOMDP) framework for coordinating autonomous agents in charge of resource allocation. Our approach leverages belief-state representations and distributed constraint optimization to enable agents to make informed decisions despite partial observability. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid environment demonstrate that our DECPOMDP-based approach outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized methods in terms of resource allocation efficiency and grid stability.
