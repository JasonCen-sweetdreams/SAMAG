As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to ensure that VR experiences are accessible and enjoyable for users with diverse abilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) that can facilitate inclusive VR interactions. We propose a set of guidelines for ECA design, incorporating principles from human-computer interaction, social psychology, and disability studies. Our user study with 30 participants, including individuals with visual and hearing impairments, demonstrates that our ECA design approach can significantly improve user engagement, comfort, and overall VR experience quality.
