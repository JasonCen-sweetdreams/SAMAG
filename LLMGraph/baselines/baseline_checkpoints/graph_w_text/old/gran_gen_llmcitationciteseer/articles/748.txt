Graph databases have become increasingly popular for managing complex relationships between entities. However, indexing large graphs remains a significant challenge, particularly for querying and traversing massive datasets. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, 'HierBloom', which leverages hierarchical Bloom filters to efficiently store and query graph structures. By adaptively partitioning the graph into smaller subgraphs and employing Bloom filters at each level, HierBloom reduces storage overhead, accelerates query processing, and scales to massive graphs with billions of nodes and edges. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
