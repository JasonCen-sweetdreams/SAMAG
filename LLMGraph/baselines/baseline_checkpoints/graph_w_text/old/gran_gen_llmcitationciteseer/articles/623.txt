Optimizing query execution plans in distributed relational databases is a complex problem due to the exponential growth of possible plans. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to efficiently explore the plan space. Our method, called QOptRL, uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that adapts to changing database statistics and query patterns. We evaluate QOptRL on a real-world distributed database benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
