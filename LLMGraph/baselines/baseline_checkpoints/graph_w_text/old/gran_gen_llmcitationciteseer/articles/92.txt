Knowledge graph completion is a fundamental task in artificial intelligence, where the goal is to infer missing entity relationships. Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in this process, as it involves resolving ambiguity in entity references. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'GraphDisamb', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model entity relationships and perform disambiguation. Our method incorporates entity type information and neighboring entity context to improve disambiguation accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphDisamb outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12% increase in F1-score.
