Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing methods rely on shallow models that fail to capture complex user-item relationships. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both user and item graphs to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. Our model learns to identify important nodes and edges in the graph, enabling it to provide accurate and interpretable recommendations. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
