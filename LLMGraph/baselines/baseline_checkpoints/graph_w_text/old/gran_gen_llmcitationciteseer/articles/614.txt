Distributed search engines face significant scalability challenges when handling complex queries. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages semantic relationships between query terms to prune irrelevant documents and reduce the search space. Our HQE method integrates a graph-based query representation with a distributed indexing strategy, achieving an average 30% reduction in query latency and 25% improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on a large-scale web dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in real-world search scenarios.
