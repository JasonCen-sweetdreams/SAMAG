Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but current interfaces often neglect the importance of embodied cognition. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interaction framework that leverages the cognitive benefits of bodily engagement in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, comparing our approach to traditional controller-based interaction. Results show that gesture-based interaction enhances user experience, improves task performance, and increases feelings of presence and immersion. Our findings have significant implications for the design of future VR systems, highlighting the need for a more holistic understanding of human cognition in virtual environments.
