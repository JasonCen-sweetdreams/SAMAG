Time series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time series anomaly detection. Our model utilizes a hierarchical structure to capture complex temporal dependencies and attention mechanisms to highlight relevant input features. We evaluate HAN on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and explainability. We also provide visualizations to illustrate the attention weights, enabling domain experts to understand the anomaly detection process.
