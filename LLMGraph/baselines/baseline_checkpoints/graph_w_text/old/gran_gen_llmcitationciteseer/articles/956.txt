Task allocation is a critical problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities must be assigned to tasks with different priorities. This paper proposes a novel approach using reinforcement learning to adaptively allocate tasks in dynamic environments. Our method, 'AdaptAlloc', learns to adjusts task assignments based on agent performance, task urgency, and environmental changes. We evaluate AdaptAlloc in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced response times compared to traditional static allocation methods. Our approach shows promise for real-world applications, such as search and rescue operations or autonomous vehicle fleet management.
