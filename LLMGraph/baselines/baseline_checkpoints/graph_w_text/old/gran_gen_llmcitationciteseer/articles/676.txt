Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but existing interfaces often neglect the diverse needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents EmbodiVR, a novel framework that leverages machine learning to create adaptive, embodiment-aware interfaces in VR. By analyzing user behavior and physical abilities, EmbodiVR dynamically adjusts interaction modalities, such as gesture recognition and haptic feedback, to accommodate individual needs. Our user study demonstrates significant improvements in accessibility and user experience for participants with motor disabilities, highlighting the potential of EmbodiVR to democratize VR adoption.
