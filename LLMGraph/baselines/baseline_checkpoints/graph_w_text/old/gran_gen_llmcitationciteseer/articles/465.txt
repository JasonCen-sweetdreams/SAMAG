Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) enables fast analytics on fresh data, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'InView', a novel query optimization framework that leverages incremental view maintenance (IVM) to minimize recomputation costs. InView uses a probabilistic cost model to predict the benefit of IVM and selectively applies it to frequently accessed views. Our experiments on a large-scale RTDW benchmark demonstrate that InView reduces query latency by up to 3.5x compared to traditional query optimization techniques, while maintaining high data freshness.
