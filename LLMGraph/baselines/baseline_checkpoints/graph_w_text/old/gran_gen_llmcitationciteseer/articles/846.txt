Distributed database systems are increasingly used to store and process large amounts of time-series data. However, indexing such data efficiently remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing scheme, 'TS-Index', which leverages the temporal and spatial correlations inherent in time-series data. TS-Index uses a combination of hierarchical clustering and prefix compression to achieve a reduction in storage overhead and query response time. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that TS-Index outperforms existing indexing methods, achieving an average query speedup of 3.2x and storage savings of 25%.
