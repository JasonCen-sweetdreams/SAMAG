Virtual reality (VR) technology has seen significant advancements in recent years, but user experience remains a crucial aspect of its adoption. This study investigates the effect of haptic feedback on user experience in VR environments. We designed an experiment using a custom-built VR system with varying levels of haptic feedback and evaluated user performance, satisfaction, and cognitive load. Results show that the incorporation of haptic feedback significantly improves user performance and satisfaction, while reducing cognitive load. Furthermore, we identify the optimal level of haptic feedback that balances user experience and system complexity. The findings of this study have implications for the design of immersive and interactive VR systems.
