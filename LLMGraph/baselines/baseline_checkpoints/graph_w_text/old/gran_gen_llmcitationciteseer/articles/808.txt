Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their adoption by older adults with cognitive impairments is hindered by inaccessible design. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, 'ElderAssist', tailored to the needs of older adults with dementia. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 older adults and 5 caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. ElderAssist incorporates adaptive speech recognition, personalized prompts, and multimodal feedback to facilitate interaction. A pilot study with 10 older adults demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
