Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data management, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the database schema and query plans as graphs and leverage GNNs to learn efficient query execution strategies. Our approach, called 'GNOpt', incorporates both query and data characteristics to optimize query plans, reducing response times by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques. Experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of GNOpt in various distributed database settings.
