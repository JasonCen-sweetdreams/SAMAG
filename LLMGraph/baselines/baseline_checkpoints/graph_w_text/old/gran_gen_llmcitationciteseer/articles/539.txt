Cloud-based database-as-a-service (DBaaS) platforms have become increasingly popular due to their scalability and cost-effectiveness. However, multi-tenancy introduces significant query optimization challenges. This paper presents 'OptiMT', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning-based cardinality estimation and adaptive indexing to minimize query latency and improve resource utilization. We evaluate OptiMT on a real-world DBaaS platform and demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional query optimization techniques, particularly for complex queries and varying workloads.
