Graph databases are increasingly used in various applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on heuristics or exhaustive searches, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages machine learning and constraint programming to efficiently explore the query plan space. GraphOpt incorporates a learned cost model and a probabilistic pruning strategy to reduce the search space, resulting in improved query performance and scalability. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
