Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources to meet dynamic workload demands. This paper presents a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning (DHRL) framework that learns to optimize resource allocation in a distributed cloud environment. The DHRL agent consists of a high-level policy network that selects a resource allocation strategy and a low-level actor network that executes the chosen strategy. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods and achieves near-optimal resource utilization in simulated cloud environments.
