The proliferation of fake news on social media has severe consequences for individuals and society. While existing detection methods rely on handcrafted features or shallow neural networks, we propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) to model the complex relationships between news articles, users, and propagation patterns. HGAT leverages graph attention to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges, enabling explainable detection of fake news. Our experiments on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.5% in terms of F1-score, while providing interpretable insights into the detection process.
