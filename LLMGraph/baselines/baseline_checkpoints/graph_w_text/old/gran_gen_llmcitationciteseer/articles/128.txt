Query optimization is a critical component of database systems, as it directly impacts performance and scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL) for distributed database systems. Our method, called 'RL-Opt', leverages an RL agent to learn the optimal execution plan for a given query, based on the system's current workload and resource availability. We conduct extensive experiments on a real-world dataset and demonstrate that RL-Opt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average query response time improvement of 35% and a reduction in resource utilization by 27%
