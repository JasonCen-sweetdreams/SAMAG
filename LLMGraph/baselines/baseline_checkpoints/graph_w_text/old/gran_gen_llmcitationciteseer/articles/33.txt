Query optimization is a critical component of modern database systems, especially when dealing with multi-dimensional data. This paper introduces a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the benefits of grid-based and tree-based indexing techniques. Our proposed method, called 'HybridGrid', adaptively selects the most suitable indexing strategy based on the query workload and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that HybridGrid outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 30% in terms of query response time, while maintaining a reasonable storage overhead.
