In cooperative multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework based on auction-based mechanisms, which enables agents to dynamically bid for tasks and allocate resources in a decentralized manner. We introduce a novel auction protocol that incorporates agent-specific utility functions, allowing for more flexible and adaptive task allocation. Experimental results demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
