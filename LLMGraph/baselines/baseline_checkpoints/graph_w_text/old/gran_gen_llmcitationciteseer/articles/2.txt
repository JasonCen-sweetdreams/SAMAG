Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, where query expansion techniques are commonly employed to enhance retrieval performance. We propose a novel neural re-ranking approach, 'NeuQE', which leverages a transformer-based architecture to model query-document relationships. NeuQE adaptively re-weights and expands the original query terms based on the semantic context of the top-ranked documents. Our experiments on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that NeuQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
