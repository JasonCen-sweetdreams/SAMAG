This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to model complex agent interactions and tasks. Our approach, dubbed 'AgentGNN', enables agents to locally communicate and negotiate task assignments, while the GNN learns to optimize global system performance. We evaluate AgentGNN on simulated swarm robotics and disaster response scenarios, demonstrating improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional centralized and distributed methods. The results have implications for real-world applications, such as search and rescue operations and warehouse automation.
