Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to assign tasks to optimize global performance. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative Task Allocation framework using Graph Convolutional Networks (CTA-GCN). CTA-GCN leverages the graph structure of the agent network to learn a task allocation policy that balances individual and global objectives. Our experiments on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that CTA-GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, latency, and robustness to agent failures. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence and optimality of our approach.
