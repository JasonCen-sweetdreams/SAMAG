In big data analytics, materialized views are crucial for efficient query processing. However, maintaining these views incrementally in distributed databases poses significant challenges. This paper proposes a novel algorithm, 'DynaView', which leverages data partitioning and incremental computation to reduce view maintenance costs. DynaView adapts to changing data distributions and query workloads, ensuring optimal performance and freshness of materialized views. Experimental evaluation on a distributed database cluster demonstrates that DynaView outperforms existing approaches by up to 3x in terms of maintenance overhead and query latency.
