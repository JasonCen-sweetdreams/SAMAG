In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive solutions. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to agents in real-time. Our method, called TAGNN, represents the agent network as a graph and employs a GNN to learn a distributed task allocation policy. We evaluate TAGNN on a variety of scenarios and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing agent capabilities and task requirements, outperforming traditional centralized methods in terms of completion time and resource utilization.
