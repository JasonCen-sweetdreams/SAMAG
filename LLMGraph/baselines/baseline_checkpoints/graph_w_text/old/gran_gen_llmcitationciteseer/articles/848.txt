In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient coalition formation among agents. This paper proposes a decentralized coalition formation algorithm, 'DCFA', which enables agents to self-organize and form coalitions in a distributed manner. DCFA uses a novel graph-based approach to model agent interactions and incorporates a heuristic search mechanism to optimize coalition structures. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that DCFA outperforms existing centralized approaches in terms of coalition stability and task allocation efficiency.
