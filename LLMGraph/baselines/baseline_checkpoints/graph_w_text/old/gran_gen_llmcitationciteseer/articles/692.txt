Anomaly detection in time series data is a challenging task, particularly when dealing with complex patterns and long-range dependencies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) architecture for identifying anomalies in multivariate time series data. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between variables and hierarchical graph pooling to capture long-range dependencies. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of anomaly detection accuracy and robustness.
