Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a widely used technique to improve retrieval performance, but it often relies on manual feature engineering and simplistic weighting schemes. This paper proposes a neural ranking model-based approach to query expansion, which learns to predict relevant expansion terms directly from the query-document interaction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements over traditional query expansion methods. Furthermore, we analyze the learned expansion strategies and provide insights into the importance of semantic and syntactic features for effective query expansion.
