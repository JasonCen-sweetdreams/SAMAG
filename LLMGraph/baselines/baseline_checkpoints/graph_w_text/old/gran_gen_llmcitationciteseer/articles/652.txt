Older adults face significant barriers when interacting with technology, particularly due to age-related motor skill decline. This paper presents a novel approach to designing accessible gestural interfaces that can be used by older adults. We propose a machine learning-based hand tracking system that can accurately detect and recognize hand gestures, even in the presence of motor skill impairments. Our system uses a combination of computer vision and machine learning algorithms to track hand movements and identify specific gestures. We conducted a user study with 20 older adults and found that our system significantly improved gesture recognition accuracy compared to traditional methods. Our findings have implications for designing more inclusive and accessible interfaces for older adults.
