Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity and limited interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention neural network (HANN) architecture that leverages both local and global context to identify anomalies efficiently. We introduce a multi-scale attention mechanism that adaptively selects relevant time segments and features, enabling accurate detection of anomalies with minimal labeling requirements. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HANN in outperforming state-of-the-art methods while reducing computational overhead.
