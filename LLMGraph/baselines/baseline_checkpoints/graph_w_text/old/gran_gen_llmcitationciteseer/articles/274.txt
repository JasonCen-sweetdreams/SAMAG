Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a crucial component in various AI applications. However, the construction of large-scale KGs is hindered by the entity disambiguation (ED) problem, where entities with similar names need to be distinguished. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding approach, GraphED, that scales to large datasets by leveraging graph neural networks and hierarchical clustering. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphED outperforms state-of-the-art ED methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, achieving a 25% reduction in computational time while maintaining a 95% precision rate.
