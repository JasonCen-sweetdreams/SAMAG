Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel approach to scalable query optimization for column-store databases, leveraging a hybrid of rule-based and cost-based optimization techniques. We propose a new cost model that accurately estimates query execution times and develops a set of optimization rules tailored to column-store storage. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving up to 3x improvement in query response times.
