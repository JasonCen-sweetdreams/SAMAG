Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults, who may face cognitive, sensory, and motor impairments. This paper presents a multimodal approach to enhance the accessibility of voice assistants for this population. We propose a novel framework that incorporates visual, tactile, and auditory cues to facilitate user interaction. A user study with 30 older adults demonstrates that our approach significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional voice assistants. Our findings inform the design of more inclusive voice assistants that can empower older adults to engage with technology more confidently.
