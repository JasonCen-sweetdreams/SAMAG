This paper presents a novel framework for designing adaptive gesture recognition systems that cater to diverse user populations, including individuals with motor impairments. Our approach leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize and adapt to variations in gesture patterns, ensuring accurate and inclusive interaction. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, including individuals with cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, and spinal cord injuries, and demonstrated significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
