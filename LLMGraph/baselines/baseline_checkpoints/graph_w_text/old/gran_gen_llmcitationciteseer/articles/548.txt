Conversational AI systems often struggle to detect intent from limited user interactions. This paper presents a meta-learning approach, 'MetaIntent', which enables few-shot intent detection by leveraging a large corpus of annotated conversations. Our method uses episodic training with a novel intent-aware loss function to adapt to new intent types. Experiments on a benchmark conversational dataset demonstrate that MetaIntent outperforms state-of-the-art intent detection models, achieving 12% higher accuracy with only 5-shot learning. We also show that MetaIntent can generalize to unseen intent types and adapt to changing user behavior.
