Explainability is a crucial aspect of modern recommendation systems, as it enables users to understand the reasoning behind suggested items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that integrates item relationships and user preferences to generate personalized explanations. HGAT employs a hierarchical self-attention mechanism to capture complex item dependencies and generates interpretable explanations through attention weights. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
