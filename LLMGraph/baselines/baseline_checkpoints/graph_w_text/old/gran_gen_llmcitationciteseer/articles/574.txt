Patent retrieval is a complex task that requires accurate query representation to retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using graph-based keyword embeddings. We construct a heterogeneous graph that incorporates patent metadata, citation networks, and keyword co-occurrences. Our method, dubbed 'Patent2Vec', learns dense vector representations for keywords that capture their semantic relationships and contextual dependencies. Experimental results on a large patent dataset show that Patent2Vec significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a 23% improvement in mean average precision and a 17% increase in recall.
