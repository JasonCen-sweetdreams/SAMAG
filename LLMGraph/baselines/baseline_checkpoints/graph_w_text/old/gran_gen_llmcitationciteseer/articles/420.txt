The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to complex resource allocation challenges. This paper proposes a decentralized autonomous agent framework, 'AdaRA', that enables adaptive resource allocation in IoT networks. AdaRA leverages multi-agent systems and reinforcement learning to optimize resource utilization, ensuring efficient and scalable allocation of bandwidth, storage, and computation resources. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaRA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of resource utilization, latency, and energy efficiency, making it an attractive solution for large-scale IoT networks.
