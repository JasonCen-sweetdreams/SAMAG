This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging auction-based mechanisms to efficiently assign tasks to agents. Our approach, called 'AuctionMAS', utilizes a distributed auction protocol that enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We introduce a novel bid-generation algorithm that takes into account task dependencies, agent heterogeneity, and communication constraints. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that AuctionMAS outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system robustness.
