Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, optimizing query execution plans for these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query execution plan policy. We design a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that captures the query execution process and use deep Q-networks to learn the policy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
