Traditional ranking models in search engines rely on hand-crafted features, which can be limited in capturing complex document relationships. This paper proposes a hybrid neural ranking model, 'HyRN', that integrates the strengths of neural networks and traditional ranking models. HyRN employs a neural ranking module to learn semantic document representations and a traditional ranking module to leverage domain-specific knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HyRN on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in ranking accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models. Our approach has the potential to enhance the search experience in modern search engines.
