Sparse document collections, characterized by a high proportion of zero-valued features, pose significant challenges to traditional information retrieval (IR) techniques. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-Sparse', which leverages the intrinsic structure of sparse data to improve retrieval efficiency. By recursively applying a sparse-aware term weighting scheme and incorporating pseudo-relevance feedback, HQE-Sparse achieves substantial gains in retrieval accuracy and reduces computational overhead compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in retrieving relevant documents from sparse collections.
