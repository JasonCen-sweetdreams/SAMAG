In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for effective collaboration and achievement of global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using graph neural networks (GNNs) that leverages the structural properties of agent interactions. Our approach, dubbed 'GNN-TA', represents the agent network as a graph and learns a node-level representation that captures task affinities and agent capabilities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-TA in various task allocation scenarios, showcasing improved allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional centralized and distributed methods.
