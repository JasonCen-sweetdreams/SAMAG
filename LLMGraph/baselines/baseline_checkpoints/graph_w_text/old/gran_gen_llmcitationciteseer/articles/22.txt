In multi-agent systems, negotiation is a crucial component for achieving cooperation and resolving conflicts. This paper presents a novel autonomous negotiation strategy, 'DynaNegot', tailored for dynamic environments where agent goals and preferences are subject to change. DynaNegot integrates a reinforcement learning approach with a cognitive reasoning framework, enabling agents to adapt their negotiation tactics based on real-time feedback and opponent modeling. Experimental results in a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate that DynaNegot outperforms existing negotiation strategies in terms of negotiation efficiency, fairness, and adaptability.
