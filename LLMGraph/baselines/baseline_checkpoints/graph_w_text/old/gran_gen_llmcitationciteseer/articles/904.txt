Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but existing VR interfaces often neglect the needs of users with visual impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive VR interfaces, focusing on tactile and auditory feedback mechanisms. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with visually impaired individuals, resulting in the development of a novel VR interface that leverages 3D audio cues and haptic feedback to facilitate navigation and interaction. User studies demonstrate significant improvements in usability and user experience for visually impaired users, paving the way for more inclusive VR applications.
