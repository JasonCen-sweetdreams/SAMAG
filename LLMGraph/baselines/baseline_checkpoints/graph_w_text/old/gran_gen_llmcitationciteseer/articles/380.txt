As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to ensure that older adults with cognitive impairments can effectively interact with these systems. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR interfaces for this population. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with 15 older adults with cognitive impairments and 5 caregivers to identify design requirements. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and personalized customization in VR interfaces. We propose a novel interface framework that incorporates these principles and demonstrate its effectiveness in a user study with 20 participants.
