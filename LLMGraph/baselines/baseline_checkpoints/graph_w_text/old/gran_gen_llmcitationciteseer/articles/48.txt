This paper addresses the problem of cooperative task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities need to collaborate to achieve complex tasks. We propose a distributed constraint optimization framework that leverages local problem solving and iterative constraint propagation to find a globally optimal task assignment. Our approach is shown to outperform centralized optimization methods in terms of solution quality and scalability, while also providing robustness to agent failures and communication disruptions. Experimental results on a real-world search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in dynamic and uncertain environments.
