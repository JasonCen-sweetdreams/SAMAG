This paper proposes a novel decentralized multi-agent system for cooperative task allocation in dynamic environments. Our approach leverages a distributed auction-based mechanism, where agents bid on tasks based on their capabilities and available resources. We introduce a novel task allocation algorithm that adapts to changing environmental conditions and agent availability, ensuring efficient and effective task completion. Experimental results demonstrate the scalability and robustness of our approach in simulated disaster response scenarios, outperforming traditional centralized allocation methods.
