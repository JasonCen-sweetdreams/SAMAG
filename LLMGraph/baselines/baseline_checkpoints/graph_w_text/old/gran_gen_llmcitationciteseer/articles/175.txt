Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on effective passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. However, existing methods often struggle with scalability and accuracy. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical embedding approach, 'HierPass', which represents passages at multiple granularities to capture both local and global context. We demonstrate that HierPass significantly outperforms state-of-the-art dense retrieval models on several ODQA benchmarks, while requiring fewer computational resources. Our method also enables efficient incremental indexing and querying, making it suitable for real-world applications.
