Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to develop inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to understand their needs and preferences. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and simple voice prompts, personalized feedback, and error tolerance. We propose a set of design guidelines and a prototype system, 'ElderVoice', which incorporates these requirements. Evaluation results show that ElderVoice significantly improves the user experience and task completion rates for older adults.
