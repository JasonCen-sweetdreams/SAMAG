Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features at multiple levels of abstraction. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention modules and a hierarchical fusion mechanism, enabling it to capture both local and global patterns in multi-modal data. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of emotion recognition accuracy and efficiency.
