Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems rely on hand-crafted features and ranking models, which struggle to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'NeuRank', which leverages query expansion techniques to improve retrieval effectiveness. NeuRank employs a transformer-based architecture to jointly learn query-document representations and a ranking function. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuRank outperforms state-of-the-art IR models, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
