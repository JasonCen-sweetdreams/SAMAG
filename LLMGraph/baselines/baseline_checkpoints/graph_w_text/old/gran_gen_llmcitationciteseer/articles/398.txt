Voice assistants have transformed the way we interact with technology, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted co-design workshops with 20 older adults to identify their needs, preferences, and pain points. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and simple voice commands, visual feedback, and personalized assistance. We propose a set of design guidelines and a prototype voice assistant, 'ElderAssist', that incorporates these features. A usability study with 15 older adults demonstrates the effectiveness of ElderAssist in improving task completion rates and user satisfaction.
