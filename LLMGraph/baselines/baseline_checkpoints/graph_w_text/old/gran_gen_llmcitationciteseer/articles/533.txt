This paper presents a novel approach to gesture recognition systems that adapt to the abilities of individuals with motor impairments. Our system, 'Adapta Gesture', uses a machine learning-based framework to learn the unique gesture patterns of each user and adjusts its recognition thresholds accordingly. We evaluate Adapta Gesture on a dataset of gestures collected from individuals with cerebral palsy and spinal cord injuries, demonstrating a significant improvement in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to conventional gesture recognition systems. We also provide a comprehensive evaluation of the system's usability and accessibility features.
