As urban populations grow, intelligent traffic management is crucial for reducing congestion and improving air quality. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for coordinating multi-agent systems in smart traffic management. Our approach, 'Hierarchical Agent Coordination' (HAC), comprises a decentralized decision-making process where agents learn to optimize traffic signal control and routing strategies using a hierarchical representation of the traffic network. Experimental results on a real-world traffic dataset demonstrate that HAC reduces average travel time by 23% and emissions by 18% compared to traditional optimization methods.
