Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their performance and reliability. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect adversarial attacks using graph-based anomaly detection. We represent the neural network's activation patterns as a graph and identify anomalies using graph-based metrics. Our approach, 'GraphSentry', is shown to outperform existing methods in detecting adversarial attacks on various benchmark datasets. We also provide theoretical insights into the robustness of our approach against adaptive attacks.
