Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in older adults' daily lives, but their utility is hindered by cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant, 'EasyVoice', tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops and usability studies to identify key challenges and opportunities. EasyVoice incorporates simplifications to the dialogue flow, visual feedback, and error tolerance to facilitate successful task completion. Our evaluation with 30 older adults with cognitive impairments demonstrates significant improvements in task success rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
