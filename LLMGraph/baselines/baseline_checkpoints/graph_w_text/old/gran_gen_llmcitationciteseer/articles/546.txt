Neural search engines have shown promising results in capturing semantic relationships between queries and documents. However, they often struggle with out-of-vocabulary terms and ambiguity in user queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to incorporate semantic meaning into the query representation. We introduce a graph-based attention mechanism that adaptively weighs the importance of related entities and concepts, enabling more effective expansion of the original query. Experimental results on a large-scale IR benchmark dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness to query ambiguity.
