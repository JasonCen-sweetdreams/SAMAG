This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems using hierarchical reinforcement learning. We introduce a hierarchical framework that enables agents to learn both high-level strategies and low-level actions in a decentralized manner. Our approach leverages a hierarchical actor-critic architecture, where each agent learns to select strategies based on its local observations and receives feedback from a high-level critic. We evaluate our approach in a simulated traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved coordination and reduced congestion compared to traditional decentralized reinforcement learning methods.
