Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexities of data distribution, network latency, and resource constraints. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to select optimal query plans based on feedback from the environment. Our approach, called 'DQO', leverages a deep Q-network to learn a policy that adapts to changing workload patterns and system dynamics. Experiments on a real-world distributed database system show that DQO outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
