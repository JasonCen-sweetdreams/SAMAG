In multi-agent systems, communication delays can significantly impact the effectiveness of coordination strategies. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertain communication delays by proposing a novel framework that integrates model-based reasoning with online learning. We introduce a probabilistic modeling approach to capture the uncertainty of communication delays and develop a decentralized coordination algorithm that adapts to changing delay patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of our approach in various scenarios, including search and rescue operations and autonomous vehicle coordination.
