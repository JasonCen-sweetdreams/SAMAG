Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but the role of embodied cognition in VR remains understudied. This paper investigates the impact of gesture-based interaction on spatial reasoning and problem-solving in immersive VR environments. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, analyzing their gestures, brain activity, and performance on spatial tasks. Our results suggest that embodied cognition significantly enhances spatial reasoning in VR, and that gesture-based interaction can improve problem-solving accuracy by 23%. We propose a new taxonomy for embodied cognition in VR and discuss implications for VR-based education and training.
