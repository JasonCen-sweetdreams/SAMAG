 Passage retrieval is a critical component in many information retrieval systems, but it can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation (HDR) method that enables efficient passage retrieval. HDR represents documents as a hierarchical composition of passage-level and document-level features, allowing for fast passage scoring and ranking. We evaluate HDR on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that HDR can be integrated with various neural ranking models to improve their performance.
