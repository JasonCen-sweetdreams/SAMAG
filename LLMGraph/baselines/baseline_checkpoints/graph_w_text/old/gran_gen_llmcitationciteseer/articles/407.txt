Question answering over knowledge graphs (KGs) relies on effective entity and relation representations. This paper presents HyperQA, a novel KG embedding method that leverages hyperbolic geometry to capture complex relationships and hierarchical structures. By exploiting the properties of hyperbolic space, HyperQA reduces the dimensionality of entity embeddings while preserving their expressiveness. We demonstrate the efficacy of HyperQA on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in question answering tasks. Furthermore, we show that HyperQA enables efficient querying and reasoning over large-scale KGs.
