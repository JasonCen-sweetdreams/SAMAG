Patent retrieval is a complex task due to the inherent ambiguity of patent claims. This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive query expansion for patent retrieval using deep learning-based semantic embeddings. Our approach leverages a multi-task learning framework to jointly learn query and document representations, enabling the model to capture nuanced semantic relationships between patent claims and relevant documents. Experimental results on a large patent dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision.
