Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale datasets, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. Our method, called 'DRL-Optimizer', uses a neural network to learn a policy for selecting the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query characteristics, and system workload. Experimental results on a realistic dataset show that DRL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, reducing query execution time by up to 30% and improving system throughput by up to 25%. We also demonstrate the adaptability of our approach to changing system conditions and query patterns.
