Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained popularity in recent years due to the need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAN) architecture for ERS, which captures complex item relationships and user preferences in a graph-structured data. Our approach leverages multi-level attention mechanisms to identify influential items and user factors, generating interpretable recommendations. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in improving recommendation accuracy and generating insightful explanations.
