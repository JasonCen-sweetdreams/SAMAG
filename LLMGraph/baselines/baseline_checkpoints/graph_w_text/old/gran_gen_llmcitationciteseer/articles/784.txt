This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation in dynamic environments using multi-agent reinforcement learning. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized Markov decision process and propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that enables agents to learn both individual and cooperative policies. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and incorporates a attention mechanism to handle dynamic task dependencies. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional methods.
