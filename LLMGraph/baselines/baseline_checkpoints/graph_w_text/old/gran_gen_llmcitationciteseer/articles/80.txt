In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and task relationships. Our approach, called GNN-Allocator, learns to allocate tasks by predicting the utility of each agent-task pair, taking into account the agents' capabilities, task dependencies, and communication constraints. We evaluate GNN-Allocator on a set of benchmark scenarios and demonstrate its ability to outperform traditional decentralized allocation methods, such as consensus-based and auction-based approaches, in terms of task completion rate and overall system utility.
