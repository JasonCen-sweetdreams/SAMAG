Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, but the lack of interpretability in traditional deep learning models hinders their adoption. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network, 'HAT-Forecast', which learns to focus on relevant temporal and spatial dependencies in multivariate time-series data. By incorporating explainable attention mechanisms, HAT-Forecast provides insights into the forecast generation process, improving model trustworthiness. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HAT-Forecast outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and interpretability.
