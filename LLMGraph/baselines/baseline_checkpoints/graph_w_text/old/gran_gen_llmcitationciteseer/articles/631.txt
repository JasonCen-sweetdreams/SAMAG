Distributed database systems are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing query execution plans in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed databases. Our method, called 'RL-QOpt', learns to adapt to changing workload patterns and data distributions, leading to improved query performance and reduced latency. We evaluate RL-QOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements over traditional query optimization techniques.
