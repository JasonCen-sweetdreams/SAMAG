Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important in today's fast-paced business environment. However, query optimization remains a major bottleneck in achieving timely insights. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning. We design a Reinforcement Learning-based Query Optimizer (RL-QO) that learns to generate optimal query plans for real-time data warehousing workloads. Our approach leverages a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan from a large state-action space. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-QO outperforms traditional query optimizers in reducing query execution time and improving overall system performance.
