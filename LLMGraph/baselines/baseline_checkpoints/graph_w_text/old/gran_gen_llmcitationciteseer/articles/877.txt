Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the usability and accessibility of commercial voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, examining their interactions with three popular voice assistants. Our results highlight significant challenges, including difficulties with voice recognition, unclear feedback, and inadequate error handling. We derive design recommendations for more inclusive conversational interfaces, emphasizing the importance of user-centered design and accessible feedback mechanisms.
