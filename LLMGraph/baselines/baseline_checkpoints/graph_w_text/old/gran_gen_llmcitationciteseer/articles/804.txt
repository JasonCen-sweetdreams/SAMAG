Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, 'ContextEmb', which leverages context-aware embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and their surrounding context. Our method integrates a graph-based attention mechanism to weigh the importance of contextual features, leading to more effective expansion of query representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ContextEmb achieves significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
