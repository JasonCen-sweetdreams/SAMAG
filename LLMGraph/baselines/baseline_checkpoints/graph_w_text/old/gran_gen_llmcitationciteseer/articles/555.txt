Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often neglect the unique needs of this population. This study presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive VR interface, 'ElderVR', tailored to the cognitive and accessibility requirements of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability testing sessions with participants from local senior centers. The results informed the development of ElderVR, which incorporates features such as simplified navigation, high-contrast visuals, and auditory cues to facilitate wayfinding. A pilot study demonstrated significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates compared to commercial VR systems.
