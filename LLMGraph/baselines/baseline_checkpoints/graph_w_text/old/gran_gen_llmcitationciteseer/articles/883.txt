This paper presents a novel multi-agent pathfinding approach, Conflict-Based Search with Multi-Agent Real-Time A* (CBS-MARTA), for efficient traffic management in smart cities. CBS-MARTA integrates real-time traffic data with conflict-based search to optimize path planning for multiple agents, reducing traffic congestion and travel times. We demonstrate the scalability of CBS-MARTA through simulations of large-scale traffic networks, achieving a 30% reduction in average travel time compared to traditional graph-based pathfinding methods.
