Explainability is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents' decision-making processes can significantly impact overall performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach enables agents to focus on relevant features and communicate effectively through attention weights, leading to improved cooperation and coordination. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a variety of multi-agent environments, including traffic management and robotic soccer, and provide visualizations of the attention mechanisms to facilitate understanding of agent decision-making.
