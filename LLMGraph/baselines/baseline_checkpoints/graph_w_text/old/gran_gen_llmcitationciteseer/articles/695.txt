Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their designs often overlook the needs of people with dyslexia. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to individuals with dyslexia. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with dyslexia, revealing that current chatbots and voice assistants pose significant barriers to their interaction. We propose a set of design guidelines and a novel interface paradigm, 'DyslexiaAware', which incorporates multimodal support, error forgiveness, and personalized feedback. Our evaluation shows that DyslexiaAware improves interaction efficiency, reduces frustration, and enhances overall user experience for individuals with dyslexia.
