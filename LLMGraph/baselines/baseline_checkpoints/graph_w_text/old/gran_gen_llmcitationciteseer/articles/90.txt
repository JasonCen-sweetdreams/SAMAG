Autonomous navigation in dynamic environments poses significant challenges due to the inherent uncertainty and partial observability of the surroundings. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'DynaNav', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant sensory inputs and adapt to changing environmental conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav in simulated and real-world scenarios, achieving improved navigation performance and robustness compared to conventional model-based approaches.
