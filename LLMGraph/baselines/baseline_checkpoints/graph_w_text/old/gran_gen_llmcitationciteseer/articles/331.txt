With the increasing adoption of Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms, multi-tenancy has become a key feature to improve resource utilization and reduce costs. However, query optimization in multi-tenant environments poses significant challenges due to the varying workload patterns and resource constraints. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MTOpt', that leverages machine learning techniques to predict query execution times and adaptively adjust resource allocation for each tenant. Our experiments on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate that MTOpt achieves an average of 30% reduction in query latency and 25% improvement in resource utilization compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
