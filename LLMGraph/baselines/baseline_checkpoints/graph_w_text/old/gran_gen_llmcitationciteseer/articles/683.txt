Traditional document representation techniques in information retrieval rely on bag-of-words or sequential models, which fail to capture complex document structures and relationships. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for document representation, which models documents as hierarchical graphs of sentences and words. HGAT learns to attending to relevant sentences and words to form a comprehensive document representation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in ad-hoc retrieval and question answering tasks.
