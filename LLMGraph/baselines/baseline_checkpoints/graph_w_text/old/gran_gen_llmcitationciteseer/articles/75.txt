Knowledge graph retrieval (KGR) aims to retrieve relevant entities and relations from large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs). Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in KGR, but existing methods struggle with capturing complex semantic relationships between entities. We propose GraphExpan, a novel QE approach that leverages deep graph embeddings to model KG structures. GraphExpan learns a dense representation of entities and relations, enabling efficient similarity-based QE. Experimental results on popular KG datasets show that GraphExpan outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and query response time.
