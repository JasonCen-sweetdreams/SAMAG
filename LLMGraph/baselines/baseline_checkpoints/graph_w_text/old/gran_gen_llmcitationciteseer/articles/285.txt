Despite their success, recommendation systems often lack transparency and interpretability, making it challenging to understand their decision-making processes. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that incorporates explainability by design. HGAT models user preferences as a hierarchical graph, where attention mechanisms are used to selectively focus on relevant items and features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on three benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements in both recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
