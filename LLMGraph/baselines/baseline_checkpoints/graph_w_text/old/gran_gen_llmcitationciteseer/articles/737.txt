Time-series data indexing is a crucial component in various applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. Existing indexing methods suffer from high computational costs, rendering them inefficient for large-scale datasets. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical bitap algorithm, 'HierBit', which leverages the inherent structure of time-series data to achieve scalable and efficient indexing. HierBit employs a dynamic bitap allocation strategy, reducing the number of unnecessary bitap computations and resulting in significant performance improvements. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HierBit outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 5x in terms of query response time and indexing construction time.
