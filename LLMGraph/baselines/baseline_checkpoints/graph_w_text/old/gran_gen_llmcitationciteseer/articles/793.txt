Deep neural ranking models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, but often rely on manual feature engineering and query expansion techniques. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages the semantic representations learned by neural ranking models to generate context-aware expansion terms. We introduce a hierarchical clustering approach to identify salient concepts in the query and document representations, and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness on several benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that NeuroQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods and yields competitive performance with manual feature engineering approaches.
