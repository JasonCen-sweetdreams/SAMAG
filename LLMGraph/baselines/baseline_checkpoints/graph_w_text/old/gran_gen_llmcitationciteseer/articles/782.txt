Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction framework, 'ElderVoice', which combines speech, gesture, and visual cues to enhance the accessibility and usability of voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates, user satisfaction, and cognitive load reduction compared to traditional voice assistants. Our approach has important implications for promoting digital inclusion and improving the quality of life for older adults.
