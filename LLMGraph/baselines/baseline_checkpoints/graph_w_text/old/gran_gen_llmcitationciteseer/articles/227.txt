Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments require efficient task allocation to achieve their goals. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). Our novel algorithm, 'AgentDCOP', enables agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner, taking into account constraints and preferences. We evaluate AgentDCOP in a simulated environment and show that it outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of solution quality and scalability. The proposed approach has applications in multi-agent systems, smart cities, and autonomous vehicle coordination.
