Explainability is crucial in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) where agents interact with each other and the environment. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable MARL by selectively focusing on relevant agents and states. Our HAN model consists of two levels of attention: intra-agent attention for state abstraction and inter-agent attention for communication. Experimental results on the StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing insights into agent decision-making through attention visualizations.
