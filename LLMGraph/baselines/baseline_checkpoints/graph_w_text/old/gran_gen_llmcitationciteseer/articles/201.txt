Optimizing query execution in distributed database systems is a crucial task, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of modern data-intensive applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the query optimization process. We represent the query execution plan as a graph and utilize a GNN-based model to predict the optimal plan, taking into account various factors such as data distribution, network latency, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based optimization methods by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
