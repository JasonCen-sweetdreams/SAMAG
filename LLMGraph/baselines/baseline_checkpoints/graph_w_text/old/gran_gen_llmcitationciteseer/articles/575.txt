Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their error-prone nature can lead to user frustration and exclusion. This paper investigates the impact of error recovery strategies on user experience, with a focus on individuals with disabilities. We conducted a mixed-methods study, combining user interviews and a controlled experiment, to evaluate the effectiveness of three error recovery approaches: proactive, reactive, and hybrid. Our results show that a hybrid approach, which combines proactive and reactive strategies, leads to higher user satisfaction, reduced frustration, and improved task completion rates. We also identify key design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants, including personalized error handling and explicit error communication.
