Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in various applications, but its vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses a significant threat. This paper proposes a novel graph-based anomaly detection method, 'GADRL', to identify and detect adversarial attacks in DRL. Our approach leverages the structural properties of the graph-structured state and action spaces to identify anomalies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GADRL on multiple DRL environments, achieving a detection accuracy of 95.6% against state-of-the-art attack methods. Our method provides a robust defense mechanism for DRL systems, enabling their deployment in safety-critical applications.
