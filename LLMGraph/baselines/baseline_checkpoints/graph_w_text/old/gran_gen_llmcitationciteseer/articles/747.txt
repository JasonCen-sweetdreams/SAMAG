Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexities of human emotions and the differences in representation across modalities. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that learns to selectively focus on relevant modalities and features for emotion recognition. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention layers and a fusion layer that combines the outputs from each modality. We evaluate our approach on the CMU-MOSEI dataset and demonstrate improved performance over state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal inputs.
