Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data management tasks. However, optimizing query execution in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the database schema, query workload, and system resources. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that RL-QOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
