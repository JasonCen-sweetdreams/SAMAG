Virtual reality (VR) systems often struggle to provide users with effective haptic feedback, leading to a disconnect between the virtual and physical environments. This paper presents 'HapAdapt', a novel framework that uses machine learning to adapt haptic feedback in real-time based on user behavior and physiological responses. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that HapAdapt significantly improves user experience, reduces fatigue, and enhances spatial awareness in VR. Our approach has broad implications for VR applications in fields such as education, therapy, and gaming.
