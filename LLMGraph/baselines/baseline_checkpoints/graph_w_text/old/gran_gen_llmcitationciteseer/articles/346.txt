Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods often struggle to balance model performance and interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework that learns to identify relevant user and item features, as well as their interactions, to generate personalized explanations for recommendations. Our approach leverages a multi-level attention mechanism to capture both local and global patterns in user-item interactions, enabling more accurate and informative explanations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
