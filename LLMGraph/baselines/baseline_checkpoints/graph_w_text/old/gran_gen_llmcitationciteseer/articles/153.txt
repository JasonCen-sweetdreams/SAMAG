Query reformulation is a crucial step in information retrieval that aims to refine the user's query to better match the intended search intent. While traditional methods rely on handcrafted rules and heuristics, recent neural approaches have shown promise but often neglect the hierarchical structure of language. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based neural network (HANN) that models the query-document interaction at multiple granularities, capturing both local and global context. Our experiments on the TREC dataset demonstrate that HANN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, particularly for complex and ambiguous queries.
