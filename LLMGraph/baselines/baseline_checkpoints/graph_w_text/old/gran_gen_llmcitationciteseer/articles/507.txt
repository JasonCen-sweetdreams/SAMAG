In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized approach that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn task allocation policies. Our proposed framework, 'GraphTask', represents the agent communication graph as a sparse matrix and uses GCNs to learn node embeddings that capture task affinities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphTask in various simulated environments, including disaster response and warehouse management, and show significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to traditional decentralized methods.
