Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 50 participants, comparing their engagement levels with personalized and generic avatars. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user satisfaction, reduced cognitive load, and improved task performance. We also identify key factors influencing avatar personalization, including facial features, body type, and clothing style.
