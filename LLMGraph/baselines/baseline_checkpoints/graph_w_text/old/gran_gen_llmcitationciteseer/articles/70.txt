Efficient task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities must work together to achieve complex goals. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to capture agent capabilities, task requirements, and their relationships. Our approach, called KnowledgeGraphAgent, uses graph neural networks to learn a shared representation of agents and tasks, enabling agents to make informed decisions about task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that KnowledgeGraphAgent outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and team utility.
