In multi-agent systems, task planning is crucial for effective collaboration. However, real-world domains often exhibit uncertainty, making it challenging to apply traditional planning approaches. This paper introduces HTN-UDK, a hierarchical task network planning framework that explicitly models and reasons about uncertain domain knowledge. We propose a novel graph-based representation of uncertain plans, which enables efficient planning and execution in the presence of incomplete or noisy information. Experimental results in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate HTN-UDK's ability to adapt to changing domain conditions and significantly outperform existing planning methods.
