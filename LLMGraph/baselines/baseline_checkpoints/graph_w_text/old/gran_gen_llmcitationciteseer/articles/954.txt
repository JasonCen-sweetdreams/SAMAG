Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various information retrieval tasks, but their ranking capabilities can be further improved. This paper proposes an adaptive re-ranking framework that leverages multiple ranking signals and dynamically adjusts the weights of each signal based on the input query and document characteristics. Our approach, dubbed 'AdaRank', is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and demonstrates significant improvements in ranking quality and robustness compared to static re-ranking methods. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the effects of adaptive re-ranking on retrieval performance and model interpretability.
