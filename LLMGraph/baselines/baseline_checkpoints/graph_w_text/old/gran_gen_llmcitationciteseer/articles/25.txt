Conventional neural ranking models for document retrieval often struggle to capture diverse aspects of relevance, leading to redundant results. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HiRank', which incorporates a novel multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize ranking, clustering, and topic modeling objectives. HiRank leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to contextualize document representations, enabling the model to capture complex semantic relationships and retrieve more diverse documents. Experiments on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that HiRank significantly outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of retrieval diversity and relevance.
