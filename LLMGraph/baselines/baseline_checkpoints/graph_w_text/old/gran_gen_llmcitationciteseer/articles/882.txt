Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when users' queries are ambiguous or incomplete. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, 'RL-Expan', that leverages reinforcement learning to learn optimal expansion strategies. We formulate query expansion as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn the policy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that RL-Expan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
