Traditional keyword-based indexing techniques for document retrieval suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to inefficient query processing. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical semantic indexing (HSI) framework that leverages the inherent semantic structure of documents. By recursively applying a spectral clustering algorithm to the document-term matrix, HSI creates a hierarchical representation of the document collection, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HSI over state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of query response time and precision.
