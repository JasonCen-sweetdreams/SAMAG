Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies for graph queries. Our experiments on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
