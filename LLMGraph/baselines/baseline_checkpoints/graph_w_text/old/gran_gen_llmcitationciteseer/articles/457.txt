Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages subtopic mining to identify latent aspects of the query. Our method, 'SubExpan', extracts key phrases from top-retrieved documents and clusters them into subtopics using a hierarchical Dirichlet process. These subtopics are then used to expand the original query, incorporating semantic relationships and contextual information. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, with SubExpan outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
