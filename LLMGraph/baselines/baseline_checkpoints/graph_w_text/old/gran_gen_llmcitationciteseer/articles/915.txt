Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for people with visual impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of visually impaired individuals. We conducted semi-structured interviews and usability testing to identify key challenges and design requirements. Our results indicate that visually impaired users prefer multimodal interactions, explicit feedback, and personalized assistance. We propose a novel design framework, 'ConverseAccess', which incorporates these findings and demonstrates improved user experience and task completion rates in a controlled study.
