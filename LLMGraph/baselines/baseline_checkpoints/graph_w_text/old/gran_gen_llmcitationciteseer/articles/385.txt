Voice assistants have transformed the way people interact with technology, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant prototype, 'CARE', which incorporates features such as personalized dialogue management, error tolerance, and multimodal feedback. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to existing voice assistants.
