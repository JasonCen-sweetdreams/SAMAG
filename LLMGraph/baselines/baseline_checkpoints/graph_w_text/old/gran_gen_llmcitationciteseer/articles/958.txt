Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often neglect the unique needs and challenges of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating inclusive VR interfaces that accommodate cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, consistency, and multimodal feedback in VR interfaces. We propose a set of design guidelines and a novel interface framework that incorporates these principles, demonstrating improved usability and engagement among older adults with cognitive impairments.
