Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to handle ambiguous queries, leading to poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep contextualized embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, 'ConEx', uses a pre-trained language model to generate contextualized embeddings for each query term, which are then combined using a learned weighting scheme to produce an expanded query representation. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries with multiple interpretations. We also show that ConEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods on a range of evaluation metrics.
