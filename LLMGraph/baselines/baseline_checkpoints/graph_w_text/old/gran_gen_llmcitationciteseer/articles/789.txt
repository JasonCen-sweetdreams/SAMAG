Neural retrieval models have shown significant improvements in ad-hoc search tasks, but their performance can be limited by the quality of the input queries. This paper investigates the effectiveness of query expansion techniques in enhancing the retrieval performance of neural models. We propose a novel query expansion framework that leverages both semantic and syntactic features of the query terms. Our experiments on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art neural retrieval models, especially for short and ambiguous queries. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of query expansion on different types of neural models.
