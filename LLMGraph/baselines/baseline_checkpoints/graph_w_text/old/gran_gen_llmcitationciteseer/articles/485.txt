Multi-agent systems (MAS) often rely on complex decision-making processes, making it challenging to understand and explain the actions of individual agents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision making in MAS. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agent interactions, allowing for the identification of influential agents and their contributions to the decision-making process. We evaluate our method on a real-world traffic management scenario, demonstrating improved explainability and decision quality compared to existing MAS approaches.
