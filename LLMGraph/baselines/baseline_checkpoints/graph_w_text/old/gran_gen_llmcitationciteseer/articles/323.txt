Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are increasingly relying on Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to share resources and improve safety. However, efficient resource allocation in AV networks remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a decentralized agent-based framework, 'ARA', which leverages multi-agent systems to allocate resources dynamically among AVs. ARA employs a distributed constraint satisfaction approach, where agents negotiate and adapt to changing network conditions, minimizing interference and maximizing resource utilization. Simulations demonstrate that ARA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of resource efficiency and network robustness.
