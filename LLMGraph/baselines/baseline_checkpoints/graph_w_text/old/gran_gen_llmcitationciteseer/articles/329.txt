Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, particularly with the increasing adoption of graph-based models. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) framework that integrates both node- and graph-level attention mechanisms to provide interpretable recommendations. Our approach leverages the strengths of graph convolutional networks and attention-based models to capture complex relationships between users and items. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN in improving recommendation accuracy while providing insightful explanations for the recommended items.
