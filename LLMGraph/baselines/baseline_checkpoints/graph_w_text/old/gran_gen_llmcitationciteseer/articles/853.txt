Distributed databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management systems. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed query planning. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We design a DRL-based query optimizer, 'DQO', which learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database environment. Our approach leverages a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to handle the large action space and incorporates a query plan embedding technique to encode query semantics. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that DQO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
