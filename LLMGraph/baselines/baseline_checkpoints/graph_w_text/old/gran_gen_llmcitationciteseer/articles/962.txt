Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents from a massive corpus. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach that leverages a dual-encoder architecture to capture both coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic relationships between questions and passages. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR achieves state-of-the-art passage retrieval performance, outperforming existing dense retrieval models while reducing computational costs by 30%. We also analyze the effectiveness of HDR in downstream QA tasks, showing improvements in answer accuracy and latency.
