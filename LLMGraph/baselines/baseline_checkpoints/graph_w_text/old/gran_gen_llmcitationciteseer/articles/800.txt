Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various domains, including education, entertainment, and healthcare. However, the lack of personalization in VR experiences can lead to user dissatisfaction and disengagement. This paper presents a user study that explores the effects of personalization on user experience in VR. We designed and implemented a VR system that adapts to individual users' preferences, skills, and goals. Our results show that personalized VR experiences lead to significant improvements in user engagement, satisfaction, and performance. We also identify key factors that influence the effectiveness of personalization in VR, including user personality, prior experience, and task complexity.
