In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach based on distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) for task allocation in autonomous agent networks. We propose a hierarchical DCOP framework that leverages local communication and negotiation among agents to allocate tasks while respecting constraints on resources, timing, and spatial dependencies. Experimental results on a simulated robot swarm demonstrate that our approach outperforms centralized optimization methods in terms of solution quality, scalability, and robustness to agent failures.
