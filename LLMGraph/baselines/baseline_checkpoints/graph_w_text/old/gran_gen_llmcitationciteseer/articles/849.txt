This paper proposes a novel approach to cooperative task allocation in multi-agent systems, leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. We introduce a decentralized framework, 'CATAR', which enables agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing task requirements. Our method incorporates a novel reward function that balances individual agent utilities with global system efficiency, ensuring fair and efficient task allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that CATAR outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in complex task scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world applications in domains such as robotics and smart cities.
