Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed database systems, where the goal is to minimize query execution time and resource utilization. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which may not adapt well to complex and dynamic database workloads. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'QLearn', that leverages reinforcement learning to learn optimal query execution plans. QLearn uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan from a large state space, and demonstrates significant performance improvements over traditional optimization techniques on a real-world distributed database benchmark.
