Resource allocation is a critical problem in distributed systems, where efficient allocation of resources can significantly impact system performance. This paper proposes a novel autonomous agent-based framework, 'AgentRA', which leverages multi-agent systems to optimize resource allocation in distributed environments. AgentRA employs a decentralized decision-making approach, where agents negotiate and coordinate with each other to allocate resources based on system workload and resource availability. Experimental results on a simulated distributed system demonstrate that AgentRA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of response time and resource utilization.
