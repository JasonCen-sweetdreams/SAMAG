In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables explainable decision-making in such scenarios. Our HAN model learns to attend to relevant agents and their interactions, generating a interpretable attention hierarchy that highlights the most influential agents. We evaluate our approach on a variety of multi-agent environments, demonstrating improved decision-making performance and providing insights into the decision-making process. The proposed approach has significant implications for real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles and smart grids.
