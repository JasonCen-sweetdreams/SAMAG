Virtual reality (VR) technology has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information. However, the lack of haptic feedback in VR environments can lead to a sense of disconnection and reduced user engagement. This paper investigates the effect of haptic feedback on user experience in VR, focusing on task performance, presence, and emotional response. We designed a custom VR setup with a haptic feedback system and conducted a user study with 30 participants. The results show that haptic feedback significantly improves task completion time, reduces errors, and enhances the sense of presence and emotional arousal. Our findings have implications for the design of immersive VR experiences in various domains, such as gaming, education, and healthcare.
