This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, where agents learn to allocate tasks efficiently using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a novel architecture that combines graph attention networks with deep Q-networks, enabling agents to reason about task dependencies and allocate tasks in a decentralized manner. Our approach is evaluated on a range of multi-agent task allocation problems, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized task allocation methods.
