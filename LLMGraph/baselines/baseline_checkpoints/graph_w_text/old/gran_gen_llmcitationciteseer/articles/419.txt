Recommender systems have become essential in various applications, but their scalability remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that leverages the hierarchical structure of user-item interactions to improve recommendation efficiency and accuracy. Our approach involves applying graph attention mechanisms at multiple scales, from individual items to clusters and finally to the entire graph. Experimental results on large-scale datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both recommendation quality and computational efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world recommender systems.
