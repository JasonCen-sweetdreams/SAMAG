Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years, but most existing approaches rely on shallow models that fail to capture complex user-item relationships. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages graph-based representations to model user and item interactions. By hierarchically aggregating node features and applying attention mechanisms, HGAT learns to identify influential users and items, providing personalized explanations for recommendation results. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
