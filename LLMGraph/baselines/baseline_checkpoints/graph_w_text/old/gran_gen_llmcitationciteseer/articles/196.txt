Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to refine user queries to better match relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural language models, specifically BERT-based architectures. We introduce a two-stage framework that first identifies salient terms in the query context and then generates expanded queries through a masked language modeling task. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for complex and ambiguous queries, compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
