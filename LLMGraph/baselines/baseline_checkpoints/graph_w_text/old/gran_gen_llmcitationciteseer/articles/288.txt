Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, 'ElderVoice', that accommodates the needs of this population. We conducted interviews and usability testing with 20 older adults and identified key design recommendations, including simplified dialogue flows, visual feedback, and personalized error correction. A pilot study with 15 participants showed significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
