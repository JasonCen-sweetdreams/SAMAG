Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with limited communication and computation capabilities need to allocate tasks efficiently. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a decentralized task allocation strategy. We model the agent interactions as a graph and use GNNs to learn a task allocation policy that minimizes the total task completion time. Our approach is evaluated on a simulated robot swarm scenario, demonstrating improved task allocation efficiency and robustness compared to traditional decentralized methods.
