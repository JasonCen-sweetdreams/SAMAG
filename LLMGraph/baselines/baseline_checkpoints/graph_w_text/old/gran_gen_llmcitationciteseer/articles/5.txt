Sentiment analysis is a fundamental task in natural language processing, but existing approaches often neglect the complex relationships between aspects and sentiments in multi-aspect sentiment analysis. We propose a Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages graph attention mechanisms to model aspect-aspect and aspect-sentiment interactions. HGAT consists of a hierarchical structure of graph attention layers, where each layer captures increasingly abstract aspect representations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 3.2% in aspect-level sentiment accuracy.
