In heterogeneous multi-agent systems, allocating tasks efficiently is crucial for optimal performance. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to coordinate task allocation among agents with diverse capabilities. We propose a decentralized framework, 'MA-CTA', which utilizes a hybrid actor-critic architecture to learn policies for task assignment and resource allocation. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that MA-CTA outperforms traditional methods, achieving significant improvements in task completion rates and resource utilization.
