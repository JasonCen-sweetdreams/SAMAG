Distributed relational databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data systems, but optimizing query execution remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies based on the database's workload and resource constraints. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time, while also adapting to changing workload patterns.
