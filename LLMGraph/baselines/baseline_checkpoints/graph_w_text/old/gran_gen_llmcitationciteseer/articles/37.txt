In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive strategies. We propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a task allocation policy in a decentralized manner. Our method, called GraphAgent, represents the agent network as a graph and learns to predict task assignments based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. We evaluate GraphAgent on a variety of task allocation scenarios and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving system performance and adaptability compared to traditional decentralized algorithms.
