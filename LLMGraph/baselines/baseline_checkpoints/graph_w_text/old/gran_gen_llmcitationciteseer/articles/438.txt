Real-time database systems (RTDBS) require efficient query optimization to ensure predictable response times. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework for RTDBS that incorporates multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). Our approach leverages a hybrid indexing scheme, combining B-tree and hash indexing, to minimize index maintenance overhead. We propose a cost-based optimization algorithm that considers both query response time and data freshness constraints. Experimental results on a real-world RTDBS benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques, achieving up to 30% reduction in average query response time while maintaining data consistency.
