Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale datasets. However, query processing efficiency remains a significant challenge in such systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing technique, HDIR, which leverages the concept of hierarchical clustering to reduce the number of nodes involved in query processing. Our approach achieves significant improvements in query response time and throughput compared to existing indexing methods. We evaluate HDIR on a large-scale DIR system and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling diverse query workloads.
