Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for storing and processing large-scale data. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach for query optimization, which leverages the structural properties of the query graph to identify optimal execution plans. Our approach, called GraphOpt, uses a combination of graph decomposition and cost-based optimization to reduce query latency and improve system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
