Neural ranking models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but their high computational costs limit their scalability. This paper proposes a novel neural retrieval framework, 'NrRank', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to efficiently rank documents. NrRank uses a hybrid approach, combining the strengths of neural networks and traditional retrieval models. We evaluate NrRank on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in ranking performance and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models. Our approach enables the deployment of neural retrieval models in large-scale IR systems.
