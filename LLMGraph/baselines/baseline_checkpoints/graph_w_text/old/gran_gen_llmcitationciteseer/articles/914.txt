Traditional query term weighting methods in passage retrieval rely on hand-crafted heuristics or supervised learning. We propose a novel unsupervised approach, 'NeuralClick', which leverages neural click models to learn query term weights from user click behavior. Our method uses a hierarchical encoder to capture query-passage relevance and a click prediction module to optimize term weights. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset show that NeuralClick outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised methods, achieving a 12% improvement in mean average precision.
