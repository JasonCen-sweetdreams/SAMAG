The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in smart grids has introduced new challenges in resource allocation and grid stability. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent system to optimize resource allocation and reduce energy losses. We design a novel auction-based mechanism that enables agents to negotiate and allocate resources in a distributed manner, while considering physical grid constraints and uncertainty in renewable energy forecasts. Simulation results on a real-world grid dataset demonstrate that our approach can reduce energy losses by up to 15% and improve grid stability by 20% compared to traditional centralized approaches.
