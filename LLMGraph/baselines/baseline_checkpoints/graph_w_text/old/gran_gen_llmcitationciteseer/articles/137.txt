Ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'Neural Expansion' (NE), which leverages neural dense retrieval (NDR) to generate high-quality expansion terms. NE fine-tunes a pre-trained NDR model on a large corpus of text to learn dense representations of words and documents. We demonstrate that NE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods on several benchmark IR datasets, achieving improvements in both retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
