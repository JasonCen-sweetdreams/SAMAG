Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is crucial for various applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for explainable anomaly detection. Our approach leverages both global and local attention mechanisms to model complex temporal dependencies and identify anomalous patterns. We also introduce a novel interpretability technique, 'Attention Tensor Analysis', to provide insights into the model's decision-making process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
