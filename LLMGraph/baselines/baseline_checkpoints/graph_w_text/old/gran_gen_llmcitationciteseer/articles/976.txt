Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly improve the retrieval accuracy. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and often struggle to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn query expansion models. Our method, dubbed 'DeepQE', utilizes a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query representation, document ranking, and expansion term selection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
