Real-time traffic pattern prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in this domain, but their computational complexity hinders scalability. This paper proposes a novel, efficient GNN architecture, 'TrafficGNN', which leverages spatiotemporal graph decomposition and adaptive sampling to reduce computational overhead. We evaluate TrafficGNN on a large-scale traffic dataset, demonstrating improved prediction accuracy and 3x speedup compared to existing GNN-based approaches.
