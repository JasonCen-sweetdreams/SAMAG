Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their conversational interfaces often exclude users with disabilities. This paper investigates the design of inclusive conversational strategies for voice assistants, focusing on users with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study, combining surveys, interviews, and usability testing, to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our results inform the development of a set of guidelines and a prototype voice assistant that incorporates adaptive dialogue management, multimodal output, and personalized support. Our findings demonstrate the potential for inclusive voice assistants to enhance accessibility and user experience for diverse populations.
