Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are designed to efficiently search and retrieve documents from large-scale, geographically dispersed collections. However, the communication overhead incurred during query processing can significantly degrade system performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document clustering approach to reduce the number of inter-cluster queries and improve query response times. We evaluate our method on the ClueWeb09 dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query latency and throughput compared to traditional DIR architectures.
