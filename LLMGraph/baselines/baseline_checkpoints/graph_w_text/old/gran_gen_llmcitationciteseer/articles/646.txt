Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, but most existing methods lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that not only detects anomalies but also provides explainable insights. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture complex temporal patterns and identify the most informative segments contributing to the anomaly score. We evaluate HAN on several real-world datasets, demonstrating its improved detection performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
