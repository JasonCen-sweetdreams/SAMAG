Multi-agent systems often struggle to provide transparent decision-making processes, hindering trust and understanding in real-world applications. This paper introduces HAN-MAD, a novel hierarchical attention network architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent scenarios. By incorporating attention mechanisms at both local and global levels, HAN-MAD selectively focuses on relevant agents and their interactions, providing interpretable explanations for joint decisions. Experimental results on a variety of multi-agent tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN-MAD in improving decision transparency and overall system performance.
