In modern distributed search engines, the document retrieval phase is a critical bottleneck that affects query latency and result relevance. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'DistributedRank', that leverages the strengths of both neural networks and traditional ranking functions. Our approach learns to predict relevance scores of documents using a hierarchical attention mechanism, which captures both local and global contextual information. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that DistributedRank achieves significant improvements in both document ranking accuracy and query latency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
