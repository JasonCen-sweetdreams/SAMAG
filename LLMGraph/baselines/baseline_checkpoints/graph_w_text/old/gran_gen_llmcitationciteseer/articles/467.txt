Multi-label node classification is a fundamental problem in graph-based learning, where each node can belong to multiple classes. Existing methods often rely on flat graph neural networks, which fail to capture hierarchical relationships between nodes. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that incorporates multi-scale graph attention mechanisms to learn node representations at different levels of abstraction. We demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including social networks and biological graphs, and provide insights into the interpretability of the learned hierarchical representations.
