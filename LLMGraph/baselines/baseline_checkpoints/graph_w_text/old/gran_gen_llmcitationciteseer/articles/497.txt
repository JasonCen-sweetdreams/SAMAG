Node classification in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) is a challenging task due to the diversity of node types and relationships. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that leverages the hierarchical structure of HINs to improve node classification performance. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant nodes and relationships at each level of the hierarchy, enabling the model to capture complex dependencies between nodes. Experimental results on several real-world HIN datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in achieving state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks.
