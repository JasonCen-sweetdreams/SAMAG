Autonomous vehicle swarms have the potential to revolutionize urban transportation, but efficient task allocation remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for task allocation in autonomous vehicle swarms. We propose a novel algorithm, 'MARLA', which leverages hierarchical graph neural networks to learn cooperative policies for task assignment and scheduling. Our experiments demonstrate that MARLA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion rate, latency, and fairness, even in dynamic and uncertain environments.
