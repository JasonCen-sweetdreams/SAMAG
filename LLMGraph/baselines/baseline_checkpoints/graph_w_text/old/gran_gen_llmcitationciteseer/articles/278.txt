Query expansion is a crucial component in search engines to improve retrieval performance. However, existing methods often rely on static document representations, which may not capture the nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and documents. This paper proposes an adaptive document representation framework, 'AdaptRep', which dynamically updates document embeddings based on the query context. Our approach leverages a graph-based neural network to model the interaction between query terms and document entities, enabling more effective query expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaptRep outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision.
