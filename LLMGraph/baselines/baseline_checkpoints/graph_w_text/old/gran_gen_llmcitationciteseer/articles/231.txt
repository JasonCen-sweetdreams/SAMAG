Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a challenging task, especially in dynamic environments with varying workloads. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We propose a DRL-based framework, 'QueryOpt', which learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database environment. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that QueryOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of execution time and resource utilization. We also demonstrate the adaptability of QueryOpt to changing workloads and database configurations.
