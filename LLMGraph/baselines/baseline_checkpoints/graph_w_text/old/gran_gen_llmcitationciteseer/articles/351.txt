In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive solutions. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn the underlying structure of the agent-task interaction graph. Our approach, called GCN-TA, enables each agent to learn a task allocation strategy based on local observations and communicate with its neighbors to achieve global optimality. We provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of GCN-TA and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulated environments with varying graph topologies and task distributions.
