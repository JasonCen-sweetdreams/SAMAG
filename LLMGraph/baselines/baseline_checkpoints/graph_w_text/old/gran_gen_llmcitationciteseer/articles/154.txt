Task planning for autonomous robots requires integrating symbolic reasoning with neural perception and control. We present a novel hierarchical task network (HTN) planning framework that leverages neural symbolic reasoning to generate complex plans. Our approach combines a neural network-based task decomposition module with a symbolic reasoning engine to generate abstract plans, which are then refined into executable robot commands. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world robotic assembly task, showcasing improved planning efficiency and plan quality compared to traditional HTN planning methods.
