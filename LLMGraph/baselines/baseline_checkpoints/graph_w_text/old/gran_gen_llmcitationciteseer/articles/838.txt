Neural search engines have gained popularity in recent years, but their effectiveness is often hindered by the vocabulary mismatch problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using contrastive learning, which leverages the semantic relationships between words to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our method, dubbed 'ConEx', is trained on a large corpus of text data and learns to differentiate between relevant and irrelevant expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in search accuracy and efficiency.
