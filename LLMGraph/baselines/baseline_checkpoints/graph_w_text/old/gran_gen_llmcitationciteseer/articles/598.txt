This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with heterogeneous capabilities must be assigned to tasks with varying requirements. We propose a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the complex interactions between agents and tasks. Our method, dubbed 'GNN-TA', learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a graph and leverages attention mechanisms to identify the most suitable agent-task pairings. Experimental results on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms state-of-the-art task allocation algorithms in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.
