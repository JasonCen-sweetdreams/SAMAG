Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive VR interactions for visually impaired individuals. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with visually impaired participants to identify key accessibility barriers and preferences. Our findings inform the development of a set of inclusive VR design guidelines, which we validate through a usability study with a custom-built VR prototype. Our results show that our guidelines can significantly improve the VR experience for visually impaired users, enabling them to fully engage with immersive environments.
