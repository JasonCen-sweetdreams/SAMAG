Temporal graphs have become increasingly prevalent in various applications, such as social networks and IoT systems. However, querying these graphs in real-time remains a significant challenge due to their massive scale and rapid evolution. This paper presents 'ChronoIndex', a novel indexing framework that enables efficient and scalable querying of temporal graphs. ChronoIndex leverages a hierarchical indexing structure and a query-aware caching mechanism to minimize query latency. Our experiments on real-world temporal graph datasets demonstrate that ChronoIndex achieves an order of magnitude improvement in query performance compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
