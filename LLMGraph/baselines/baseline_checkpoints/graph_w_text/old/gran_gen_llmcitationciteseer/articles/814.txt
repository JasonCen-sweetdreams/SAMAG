Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and energy management. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in modeling complex dependencies in time series data. However, GNN-based models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can significantly degrade their forecasting performance. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial training framework for robust time series forecasting with GNNs. Our approach leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) to craft adversarial examples, which are then used to train a robust GNN-based forecaster. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the robustness of GNN-based time series forecasting models against various types of adversarial attacks.
