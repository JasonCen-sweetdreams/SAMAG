Microblog retrieval poses unique challenges due to the brevity and noise of tweets. Query expansion techniques can improve retrieval effectiveness, but existing methods often rely on cumbersome manual tuning of parameters. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'TweetEmb', which leverages pre-trained word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our experiments on the TREC Microblog dataset show that TweetEmb outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TweetEmb is robust to varying query lengths and can adapt to domain shifts.
