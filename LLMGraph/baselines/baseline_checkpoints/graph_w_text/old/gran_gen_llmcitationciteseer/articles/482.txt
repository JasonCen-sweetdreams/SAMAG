Specialized search engines require efficient document retrieval mechanisms to cater to specific domains. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive embedding approach, 'QAE-Doc', which dynamically adjusts the document representation based on the query context. Our method leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture query-dependent semantic relationships between terms and documents. Experimental results on a large-scale biomedical dataset demonstrate that QAE-Doc achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and accuracy compared to traditional static embedding methods.
