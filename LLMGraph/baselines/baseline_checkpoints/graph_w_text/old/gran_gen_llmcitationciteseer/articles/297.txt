Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. However, existing methods often struggle to capture the nuances of the query, leading to suboptimal retrieval results. We propose a novel query-driven document expansion approach, 'QDE', which leverages a combination of semantic and syntactic query features to generate expanded document representations. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that QDE significantly improves passage retrieval accuracy and downstream QA performance, particularly for complex, multi-hop questions.
