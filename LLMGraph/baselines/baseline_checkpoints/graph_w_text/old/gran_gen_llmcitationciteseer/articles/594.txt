Neural ranking models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc retrieval tasks. However, their robustness to query drift, where the distribution of queries changes over time, remains understudied. This paper investigates the impact of query drift on neural ranking models, including BERT-based and convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We introduce a novel query drift simulation framework and evaluate the models on a dataset of 10,000 queries with varying drift levels. Our results show that neural ranking models are susceptible to query drift, with significant decreases in retrieval performance as drift increases. We further analyze the effect of query drift on model components, including embeddings and ranking layers, and discuss implications for retrieval system design.
