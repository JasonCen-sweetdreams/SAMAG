As robots increasingly enter human-dominated workspaces, effective collaboration is crucial. This paper explores the role of embodiment in human-robot collaboration, examining how robot morphology and expressiveness influence human trust, communication, and task performance. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, comparing a humanoid robot with a non-humanoid counterpart in a shared assembly task. Results show that the humanoid robot's increased expressiveness led to higher trust ratings and improved task efficiency, but also introduced new challenges in communication and coordination. Our findings inform the design of future human-robot collaboration systems, highlighting the importance of embodied cognition in shaping human-robot interaction.
