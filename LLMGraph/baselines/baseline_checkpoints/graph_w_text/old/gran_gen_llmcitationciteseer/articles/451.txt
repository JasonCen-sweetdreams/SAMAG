Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an accessible conversational interface, 'CARE', tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 25 participants, combining interviews, surveys, and usability testing to inform our design. CARE incorporates features such as simplified language, visual cues, and error tolerance to facilitate effective communication. Our evaluation shows that CARE significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing conversational interfaces.
