In multi-agent systems, decentralized negotiation mechanisms are crucial for achieving efficient and fair outcomes. However, when agents have incomplete information about each other's preferences, the negotiation process becomes more challenging. This paper proposes a novel decentralized negotiation protocol, 'INFER', which leverages probabilistic graphical models to infer agents' preferences and updates their negotiation strategies accordingly. We theoretically analyze the convergence properties of INFER and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulations with various types of incomplete information. Our results show that INFER outperforms existing decentralized negotiation mechanisms in terms of social welfare and negotiation efficiency.
