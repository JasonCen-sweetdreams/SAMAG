Multimodal retrieval systems have gained popularity in recent years, but the effectiveness of query expansion techniques in these systems remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of various query expansion methods, including pseudo-relevance feedback, latent semantic analysis, and word embeddings, in the context of multimodal retrieval. We experiment with a large-scale dataset comprising images, videos, and text documents and analyze the impact of query expansion on retrieval performance. Our results show that a combination of query expansion techniques outperforms individual methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
