As distributed database systems continue to grow in scale and complexity, query optimization remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a novel graph-based indexing approach that leverages the structural properties of query graphs to optimize query execution plans. Our approach, dubbed 'GraphQO', constructs a compact graph index that captures the relationships between query predicates and data distributions. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that GraphQO reduces query latency by up to 40% and improves resource utilization by 25% compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
