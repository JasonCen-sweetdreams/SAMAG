Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are increasingly used to index large-scale data repositories. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complex interactions between query terms, document indexing, and network topology. This paper presents a novel hierarchical clustering approach to optimize query processing in DIR systems. Our method, 'HCQO', leverages the clustering structure to prune irrelevant documents and reduce network communication. Experimental results on a large-scale DIR benchmark demonstrate that HCQO achieves significant improvements in query response time and throughput compared to existing optimization techniques.
