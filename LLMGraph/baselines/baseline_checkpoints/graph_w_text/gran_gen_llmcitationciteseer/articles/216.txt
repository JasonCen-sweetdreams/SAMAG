Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a widely used technique to improve retrieval performance. However, existing query expansion methods rely on manual feature engineering and may not capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a neural query embedding-based approach for query expansion, which learns to represent queries and documents in a shared semantic space. Our approach, termed NeuroXPand, leverages a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query embedding and document ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
