Enterprise search systems require efficient and accurate document retrieval to meet the information needs of users. This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HNR-ES', which leverages a combination of dense passage retrieval and hierarchical attention mechanisms to improve retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Our approach reduces the candidate set of documents through a coarse-grained retrieval stage, followed by a fine-grained ranking stage that incorporates semantic and structural features of the documents. Experimental results on a large-scale enterprise search dataset demonstrate that HNR-ES outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of recall, precision, and latency.
