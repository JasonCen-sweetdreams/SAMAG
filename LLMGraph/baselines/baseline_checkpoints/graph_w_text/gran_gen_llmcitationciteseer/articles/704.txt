Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face the challenge of efficiently processing queries across multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HiDir', which leverages a two-tiered index structure to reduce query latency and improve system scalability. We introduce a dynamic indexing scheme that adaptively partitions the index based on query workload patterns, resulting in significant reductions in query processing time and network communication overhead. Experimental evaluation on a large-scale DIR testbed demonstrates the effectiveness of HiDir in enhancing query efficiency and system throughput.
