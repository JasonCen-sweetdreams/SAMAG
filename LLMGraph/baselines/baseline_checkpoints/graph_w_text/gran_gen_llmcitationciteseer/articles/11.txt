In large-scale multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive solutions. This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation that leverages adaptive reward shaping to improve the overall system performance. We propose a decentralized algorithm that allows agents to learn and adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. Our approach is evaluated on a simulated logistics domain, where we demonstrate improved task allocation efficiency and robustness compared to traditional methods. Theoretical analysis and empirical results show that our algorithm scales well with the number of agents and tasks, making it suitable for real-world applications.
