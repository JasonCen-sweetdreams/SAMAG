The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential growth in time-series data, making query optimization in such databases a pressing concern. This paper presents a novel indexing scheme, TSIndex, which leverages the temporal and spatial correlations inherent in time-series data. TSIndex uses a hybrid approach combining a partitioned B-tree index with a compact, matrix-based representation of time-series data. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TSIndex outperforms existing indexing schemes by up to 30% in terms of query response time and storage efficiency.
