Voice assistants have the potential to enhance the daily lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing systems often fail to accommodate their unique needs. This paper presents 'EasyVoice', a novel voice assistant framework designed to improve accessibility and usability for this population. EasyVoice incorporates a range of adaptive features, including simplified language processing, personalized feedback mechanisms, and error correction strategies. A user study with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
