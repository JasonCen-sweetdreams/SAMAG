Coordinating heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a challenging problem, particularly in scenarios involving agents with diverse capabilities and objectives. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn effective coordination strategies for MAS. We introduce a hierarchical DRL framework, 'CoMA', which consists of a high-level planning module and a low-level control module. The planning module learns to assign tasks to agents based on their capabilities and the control module learns to execute the assigned tasks. We evaluate CoMA in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions and agent failures.
