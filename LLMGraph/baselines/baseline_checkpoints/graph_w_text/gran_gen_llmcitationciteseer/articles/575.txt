The ever-growing size and complexity of modern databases necessitate efficient query processing. This paper explores the application of deep reinforcement learning to optimize SQL query execution plans. We propose a novel framework, 'SQL-RL', which utilizes a decision-making agent to learn an optimal query plan policy from a large database workload. SQL-RL incorporates domain-specific knowledge, such as index selection and join ordering, into the agent's decision-making process. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that SQL-RL outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time, while also adapting to changing workload patterns.
