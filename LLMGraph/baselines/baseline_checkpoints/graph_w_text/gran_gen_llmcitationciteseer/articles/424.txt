In complex, dynamic environments, multi-stakeholder decision making often involves negotiation between autonomous entities with conflicting goals. This paper proposes a novel intelligent agent-based negotiation framework, 'AgentNegotiate', which leverages machine learning and game theory to facilitate efficient and effective agreements. AgentNegotiate incorporates a cognitive architecture that models stakeholders' preferences, uncertainty, and risk attitudes, enabling agents to adapt their negotiation strategies accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentNegotiate outperforms traditional negotiation protocols in terms of agreement quality and time-to-agreement, with potential applications in e-commerce, supply chain management, and smart cities.
