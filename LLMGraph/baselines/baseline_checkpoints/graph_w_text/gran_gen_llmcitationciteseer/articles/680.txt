Patent retrieval is a critical task in intellectual property search, but traditional keyword-based approaches often suffer from limited query representation. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based query expansion method, dubbed 'PatentBERT', which leverages pre-trained language models to capture contextual relationships between query terms and patent documents. Our experiments on a large patent corpus demonstrate that PatentBERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval precision and recall, particularly for complex patent queries.
