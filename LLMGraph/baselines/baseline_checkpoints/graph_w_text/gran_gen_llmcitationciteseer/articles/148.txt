The increasing use of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices has led to a surge in time series data, making anomaly detection a critical task for ensuring system reliability and efficiency. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'TS-Autoencoder', which leverages the strengths of autoencoders and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect anomalies in multivariate time series data. We evaluate TS-Autoencoder on a real-world dataset from a manufacturing plant and demonstrate its superiority over traditional methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to noise.
