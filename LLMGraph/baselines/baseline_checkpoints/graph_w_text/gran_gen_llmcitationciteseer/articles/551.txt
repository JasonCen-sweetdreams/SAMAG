Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing more inclusive voice assistants for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and clinicians to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of 'EASE', a novel voice assistant framework that incorporates adaptive dialog management, multimodal input support, and personalized cognitive assistance. We evaluate EASE through a usability study with 20 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
