Multi-agent systems are increasingly being used to tackle complex tasks in various domains. However, cooperation among agents in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that enables effective cooperation among agents in complex environments. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent relationships at multiple scales, allowing agents to selectively focus on relevant peers and share knowledge. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
