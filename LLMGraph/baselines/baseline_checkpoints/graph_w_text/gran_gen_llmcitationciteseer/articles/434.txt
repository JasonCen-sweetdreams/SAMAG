Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches are often computationally expensive and do not scale well to large datasets. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'EDIndex', which leverages a hierarchical clustering-based approach to efficiently identify and disambiguate entities. EDIndex utilizes a combination of lexical, semantic, and structural features to create a compact index that enables fast lookup and disambiguation. Experimental results on several large-scale knowledge graphs demonstrate that EDIndex achieves significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with an average speedup of 3.5x and a reduction in memory usage of 60%.
