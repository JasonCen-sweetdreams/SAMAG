The widespread adoption of voice assistants has transformed the way people interact with technology. However, older adults often face difficulties using these systems due to physical and cognitive limitations. This paper presents a multimodal interaction study that explores the design of inclusive voice assistants tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and opportunities, and developed a novel interaction framework that integrates speech, gesture, and gaze-based inputs. Our results show that the proposed framework significantly improves the usability and accessibility of voice assistants for older adults, and provides insights for designing more inclusive and supportive systems.
