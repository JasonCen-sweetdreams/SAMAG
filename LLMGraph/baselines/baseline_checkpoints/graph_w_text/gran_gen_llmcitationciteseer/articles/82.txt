In complex dynamic environments, autonomous agents must adapt and collaborate to achieve shared goals. This paper presents a novel decentralized coalition formation algorithm, DCFA, which enables agents to form coalitions and allocate tasks efficiently. DCFA combines graph-based clustering with multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize coalition structures and task assignments. We evaluate DCFA in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing centralized approaches. Our framework has applications in real-world domains such as search and rescue, smart cities, and autonomous transportation.
