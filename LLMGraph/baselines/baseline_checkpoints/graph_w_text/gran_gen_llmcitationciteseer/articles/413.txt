Recommendation systems often rely on graph-based models to capture complex user-item relationships. However, these models can be computationally expensive and scale poorly with large graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant graph regions. We introduce a hierarchical pooling scheme that adaptively reduces graph sizes, allowing for efficient processing of large-scale recommendation datasets. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art graph-based models while reducing computational costs by up to 50%.
