Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle with lexical gaps between query terms and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel approach to hierarchical query expansion using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our model, dubbed 'GCN-Expander', learns to represent queries and documents as nodes in a graph, where edges capture semantic relationships between terms. By propagating query information through the graph, GCN-Expander generates context-aware expansion terms that improve retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant gains in precision and recall over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
