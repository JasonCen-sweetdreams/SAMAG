Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create inclusive conversational interfaces for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify design principles and requirements. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, clarity, and empathy in conversational interfaces. We propose a novel framework, 'ElderChat', which incorporates these principles and provides personalized support for older adults. A pilot study demonstrates ElderChat's effectiveness in improving user experience and reducing cognitive load.
