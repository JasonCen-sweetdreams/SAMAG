Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of query execution plans and the dynamic nature of data distribution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
