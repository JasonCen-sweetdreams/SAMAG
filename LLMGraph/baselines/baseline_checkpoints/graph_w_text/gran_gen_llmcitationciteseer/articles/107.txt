Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it aims to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep contextualized embeddings, which leverages pre-trained language models to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, called 'ConEx', generates a set of expanded queries by iteratively refining the original query based on the contextualized embeddings of its constituent terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConEx significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 12% improvement in mean average precision.
