Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by a lack of accessibility features for users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel, inclusive VR design framework that incorporates insights from disability studies and human-computer interaction. We conducted a participatory design study with 20 users with diverse abilities and developed a set of guidelines for designing accessible VR experiences. Our evaluation of a prototype VR application demonstrates significant improvements in usability and user engagement for users with disabilities. The proposed framework has implications for promoting digital inclusion and enhancing the overall VR experience.
