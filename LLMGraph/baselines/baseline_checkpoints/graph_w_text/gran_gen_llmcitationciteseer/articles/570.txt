Entity disambiguation in knowledge graphs is a challenging task, especially when dealing with ambiguous entity names. This paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Query Expansion (HQE), which leverages the hierarchical structure of knowledge graphs to generate context-aware queries for disambiguation. HQE uses a graph-based attention mechanism to select relevant entities and expand the query with related concepts, resulting in improved disambiguation accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HQE, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 15% in terms of precision and recall.
