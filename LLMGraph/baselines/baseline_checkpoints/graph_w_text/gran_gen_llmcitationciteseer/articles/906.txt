This paper presents EyeGesture, a novel, real-time eye movement-based gesture recognition system designed to enhance user experience in human-computer interaction. EyeGesture leverages a deep neural network-based approach to classify eye movements into distinct gestures, achieving an accuracy of 95.2%. Our system is capable of detecting gestures in real-time, with a latency of 50ms, making it suitable for various applications, including gaming, virtual reality, and assistive technologies. We evaluate EyeGesture on a large-scale dataset of eye movement recordings and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving user engagement and interaction.
