Virtual reality (VR) has transformed human-computer interaction, but the design of intuitive interfaces remains an open challenge. This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in VR, focusing on gesture-based interaction design. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, analyzing their gestures and brain activity while performing tasks in a custom-built VR environment. Our results show that gestures grounded in real-world experience enhance user performance and reduce cognitive load. We present a set of design guidelines for VR interface designers, emphasizing the importance of incorporating embodied cognition principles to create more natural and immersive interactions.
