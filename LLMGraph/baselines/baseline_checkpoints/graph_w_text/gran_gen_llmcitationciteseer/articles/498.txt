Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep learning-based document embeddings to effectively capture semantic relationships between terms. We demonstrate that incorporating contextualized embeddings from pre-trained language models can significantly improve retrieval performance, particularly for ambiguous or under-specified queries. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
