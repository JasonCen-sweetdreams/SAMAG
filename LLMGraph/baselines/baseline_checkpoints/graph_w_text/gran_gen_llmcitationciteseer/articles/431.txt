As the global population ages, it is essential to design user interfaces that cater to the needs of older adults. This study investigates the effectiveness of conversational UIs in reducing cognitive load for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 40 participants, comparing a conversational UI with a traditional GUI for completing everyday tasks. Our results show that the conversational UI significantly reduced cognitive load, improved task completion times, and enhanced user satisfaction. We identify key design recommendations for developers to create more accessible and usable conversational interfaces for older adults.
