The increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) on public roads demands efficient coordination strategies to ensure safety and traffic flow. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'AV-Coord', which enables AVs to learn cooperative behaviors in real-time. Our approach integrates graph neural networks with deep Q-networks to model complex interactions between AVs and their environment. Experimental results in a simulated urban scenario demonstrate that AV-Coord reduces congestion, minimizes collisions, and improves overall traffic efficiency compared to traditional rule-based approaches.
