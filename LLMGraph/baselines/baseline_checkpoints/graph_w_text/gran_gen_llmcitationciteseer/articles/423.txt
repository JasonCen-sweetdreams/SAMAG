Distributed graph databases have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to handle large-scale graph data. However, query optimization techniques for these systems are still in their infancy. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph partitioning, indexing, and caching to minimize query latency and improve throughput. We evaluate GraphOpt on a real-world social network dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing query optimization techniques.
