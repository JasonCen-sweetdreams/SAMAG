Multi-hop reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, but existing AI models struggle to provide transparent and explainable reasoning processes. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework that leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between entities and reasoning paths. HGAT utilizes a hierarchical architecture to progressively refine attention weights, enabling the model to focus on relevant entities and relationships while ignoring irrelevant ones. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate HGAT's improved performance and interpretability in multi-hop reasoning tasks, making it a promising approach for building more transparent and trustworthy AI systems.
