Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroExpand', which leverages neural semantic embeddings to better capture query intent. Our method uses a pre-trained language model to generate a weighted set of expansion terms, which are then incorporated into the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExpand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving improvements of up to 15% in mean average precision.
