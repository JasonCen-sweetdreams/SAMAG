Optimizing query execution in distributed column-stores is crucial for high-performance analytics. This paper presents an innovative approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. Our framework, 'RL-QO', learns to adapt to workload patterns and data distributions, selecting the most efficient query plan for a given query. We demonstrate that RL-QO outperforms traditional cost-based optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization, achieving speedups of up to 3.5x on TPC-H benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning in database query optimization and pave the way for further research in this area.
