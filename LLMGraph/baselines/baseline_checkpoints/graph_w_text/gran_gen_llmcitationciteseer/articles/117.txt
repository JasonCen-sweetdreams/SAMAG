Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HierarchicalGraphAD', which leverages the strengths of hierarchical clustering and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to identify anomalies in time series data. We represent time series data as graphs and employ a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify dense regions. Then, we use GCNs to learn a robust representation of the graph structure, which enables us to detect anomalies more effectively. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HierarchicalGraphAD over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency.
