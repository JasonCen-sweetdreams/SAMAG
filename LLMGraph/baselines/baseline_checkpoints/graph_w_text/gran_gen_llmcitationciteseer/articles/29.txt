Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the lives of older adults, but its adoption is hindered by age-related cognitive decline. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65-85, exploring the impact of cognitive decline on VR usability. Our results highlight the importance of simplified navigation, visual cues, and adaptable feedback mechanisms. We propose a set of design guidelines and a cognitive support framework to enhance the accessibility and engagement of VR systems for older adults.
