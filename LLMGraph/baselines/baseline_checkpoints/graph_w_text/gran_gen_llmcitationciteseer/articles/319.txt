Traditional information retrieval systems often struggle to provide diverse and relevant search results, particularly for ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages hierarchical clustering and topic modeling to retrieve a diverse set of documents. Our method, dubbed 'DivTR', first applies hierarchical clustering to group similar documents based on their semantic features. Then, it employs topic modeling to identify the underlying topics in each cluster and rank documents according to their topic relevance. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that DivTR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval diversity and precision.
