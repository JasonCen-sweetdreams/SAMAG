Decentralized edge computing has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing latency and improving quality of service in IoT applications. However, efficient resource allocation remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes an autonomous agent-based framework, 'EdgeAgent', which leverages multi-agent systems and distributed constraint optimization to dynamically allocate resources in decentralized edge computing environments. We demonstrate the efficacy of EdgeAgent in reducing latency and improving resource utilization through simulations on a real-world smart city scenario.
