Virtual reality (VR) has shown immense potential in various domains, but user experience remains a crucial aspect to be improved. This study investigates the impact of personalized avatar embodiment on user experience in VR environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR system using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that personalized avatars led to increased user engagement, self-presence, and enjoyment, while reducing cybersickness symptoms. We also found that the effects of personalized embodiment varied across different age groups and personality traits. The findings of this study have significant implications for the design of VR systems that aim to enhance user experience and promote long-term user engagement.
