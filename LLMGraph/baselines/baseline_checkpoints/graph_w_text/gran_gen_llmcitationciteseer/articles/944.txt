This paper presents a decentralized autonomous agent-based approach for resource allocation in edge computing environments. Our proposed framework, 'EdgeAgent', employs a multi-agent system to dynamically allocate resources among edge nodes, ensuring efficient task execution and minimized latency. We model the problem as a decentralized Markov decision process and develop a deep reinforcement learning-based solution for each agent to learn optimal resource allocation policies. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeAgent outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of resource utilization and application performance.
