Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive VR interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with caregivers and older adults to identify design requirements and developed a set of interface design guidelines. A prototype VR system was implemented and evaluated with 20 older adults, demonstrating improved usability and engagement compared to traditional interfaces.
