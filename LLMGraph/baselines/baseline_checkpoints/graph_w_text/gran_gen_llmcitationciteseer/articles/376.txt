Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval (IR) due to the complexity of user queries and the vastness of the document space. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, 'RL-Expander', learns to select the most informative expansion terms by interacting with the retrieval environment and receiving rewards based on the relevance of the retrieved documents. We evaluate RL-Expander on several standard IR datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
