Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has seen significant progress with the advent of neural models. However, most existing approaches rely on retrieving passages using traditional IR methods, which can be suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel ODQA framework, 'GraphRetriever', that integrates passage retrieval and neural ranking using graph-based neural networks. Our approach leverages entity relationships and contextualized embeddings to refine passage retrieval and improve answer extraction. Experimental results on the Natural Questions benchmark demonstrate that GraphRetriever outperforms state-of-the-art ODQA models, achieving an absolute gain of 3.2% in exact match score.
