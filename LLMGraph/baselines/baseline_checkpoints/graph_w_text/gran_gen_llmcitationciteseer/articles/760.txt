Unsupervised representation learning has become a crucial component of many machine learning pipelines. However, existing methods often struggle with scalability, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data. This paper presents 'Hierarchical ClusterNet', a novel approach that leverages hierarchical clustering to efficiently learn representations from large datasets. Our method iteratively applies k-means clustering to subspaces of the input data, generating a hierarchical representation that captures complex patterns and structures. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Hierarchical ClusterNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of representation quality, while reducing computational overhead by up to 75%.
