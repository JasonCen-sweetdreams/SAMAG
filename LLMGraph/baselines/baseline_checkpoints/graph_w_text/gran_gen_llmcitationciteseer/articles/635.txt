Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not fully capture the semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural network-based document embeddings to improve retrieval performance. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weights the importance of different document terms and phrases, enabling more accurate identification of relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
