Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but existing methods struggle to scale to large graphs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages a hierarchical clustering of nodes to reduce computational complexity. HGAT adaptively selects relevant node features and attention weights at each level, enabling efficient processing of massive graphs. Experimentally, we demonstrate HGAT's state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods by up to 15% in terms of node classification accuracy.
