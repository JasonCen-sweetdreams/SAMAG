This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, leveraging distributed reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize task assignments in dynamic environments. Our approach, called 'AgentDRL', enables agents to learn from local interactions and communicate with each other to achieve global optimality. We propose a novel DRL algorithm that incorporates graph neural networks to model agent relationships and a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture to balance exploration and exploitation. Experiments on a simulated multi-agent system demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentDRL in adapting to changing task requirements and outperforming traditional centralized task allocation methods.
