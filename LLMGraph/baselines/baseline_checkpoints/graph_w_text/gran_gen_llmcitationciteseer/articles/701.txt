Meta-learning has emerged as a promising approach to few-shot learning, but existing methods often suffer from poor computational efficiency and limited adaptability. This paper introduces Bayesian Neural Turing Machines (BNTMs), a new framework that combines the strengths of neural networks and probabilistic graphical models. BNTMs leverage a Bayesian inference mechanism to learn a meta-model that can adapt to new tasks with minimal data and computation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BNTMs on several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by up to 75% compared to existing methods.
