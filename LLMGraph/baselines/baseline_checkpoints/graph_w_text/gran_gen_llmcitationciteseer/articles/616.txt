This paper presents a decentralized, multi-agent system for real-time traffic management in urban environments. Our approach leverages autonomous agents to dynamically optimize traffic signal control, taking into account real-time traffic conditions, pedestrian, and cyclist activity. We propose a novel agent communication protocol that enables efficient information sharing and adapts to changing traffic patterns. Experimental results using real-world traffic data demonstrate that our approach reduces congestion, decreases travel times, and improves overall traffic flow by up to 25% compared to traditional, static traffic management systems.
