Coordinating multi-agent systems to optimize resource allocation is a challenging problem in various domains, such as smart grids and traffic management. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn decentralized policies for agent coordination. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that combines a graph neural network with a deep Q-network, enabling agents to learn cooperative strategies that adapt to dynamic environment conditions. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization methods and achieves near-optimal resource allocation.
