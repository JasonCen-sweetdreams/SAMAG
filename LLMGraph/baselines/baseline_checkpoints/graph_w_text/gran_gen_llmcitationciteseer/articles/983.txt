Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but existing VR systems often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR experiences, focusing on auditory and tactile feedback. We introduce a set of guidelines and tools for developers to create inclusive VR environments, validated through user studies with visually impaired participants. Our approach enables users to navigate and interact with virtual objects using soundscapes and haptic feedback, demonstrating significant improvements in usability and user satisfaction.
