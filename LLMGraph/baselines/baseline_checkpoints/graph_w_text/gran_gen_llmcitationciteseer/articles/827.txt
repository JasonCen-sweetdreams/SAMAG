Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when queries are short and ambiguous. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, 'HQE', which leverages hierarchical document embeddings to capture latent semantic relationships between terms and documents. HQE uses a graph neural network to learn expanded query representations, incorporating both local and global contextual information. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for difficult queries, and outperform state-of-the-art methods.
