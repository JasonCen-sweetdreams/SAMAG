Deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can have devastating consequences in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks by learning hierarchical representations. Our method, Hierarchical Adversarial Training (HAT), leverages the idea of learning multiple levels of representations and using them to regularize the model's behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAT on several benchmark datasets, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.
