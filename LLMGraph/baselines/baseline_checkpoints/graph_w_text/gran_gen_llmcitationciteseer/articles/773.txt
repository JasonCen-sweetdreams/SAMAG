In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Our approach, called MATRA, enables agents to learn to allocate tasks efficiently in a distributed manner, without relying on a centralized controller. We use a novel combination of graph neural networks and deep Q-networks to model the task allocation problem as a decentralized Markov decision process. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that MATRA outperforms traditional decentralized allocation strategies, achieving improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead.
