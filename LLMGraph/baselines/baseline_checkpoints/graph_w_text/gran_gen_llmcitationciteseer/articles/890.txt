As conversational agents become increasingly prevalent in everyday life, it is crucial to understand how design factors influence user trust. This study explores the effect of anthropomorphic design on user trust in conversational agents. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment, combining a between-subjects design with semi-structured interviews, to examine how varying levels of anthropomorphism (human-like features, emotional expressions, and social cues) affect users' perceptions of trustworthiness. Our results show that moderate anthropomorphism enhances user trust, while excessive or minimal anthropomorphism can lead to decreased trust. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of conversational agents and suggest avenues for future research.
