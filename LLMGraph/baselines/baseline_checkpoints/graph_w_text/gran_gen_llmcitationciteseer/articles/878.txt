Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper presents a novel query optimization technique that leverages hierarchical indexing to reduce the number of data transfers between nodes. Our approach, called HiQO, uses a combination of vertical and horizontal partitioning to create a hierarchical index structure that enables efficient query processing. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HiQO achieves an average query latency reduction of 35% compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
