This paper presents a novel hybrid agent-based framework for real-time traffic congestion management. Our approach integrates macroscopic traffic flow modeling with microscopic agent-based simulation, enabling the optimization of traffic signal control and routing decisions. We propose a decentralized coordination mechanism that leverages autonomous vehicle-to-infrastructure communication to adapt to changing traffic conditions. Experimental results using a large-scale traffic simulator demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in reducing congestion and travel times, while improving overall network efficiency.
