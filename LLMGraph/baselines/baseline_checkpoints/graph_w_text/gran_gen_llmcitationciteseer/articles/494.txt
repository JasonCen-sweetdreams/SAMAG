Few-shot learning has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical few-shot learning framework that leverages self-supervised metric learning to learn a robust feature representation. Our approach, dubbed 'HFS-SSL', learns a hierarchical representation by iteratively refining the feature space using episodic training. We demonstrate the efficacy of HFS-SSL on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that the self-supervised metric learning component is crucial in adapting to new classes and improving overall model robustness.
