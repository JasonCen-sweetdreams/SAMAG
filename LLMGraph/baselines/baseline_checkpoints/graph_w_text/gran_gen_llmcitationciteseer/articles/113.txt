State-of-the-art neural ranking models for information retrieval often rely on computationally expensive pairwise comparison of documents. This paper presents a novel proximity-aware neural ranking model, 'ProxRank', which exploits the spatial proximity of documents in the latent space to reduce the number of required comparisons. By incorporating a proximity-aware attention mechanism and a hierarchical ranking strategy, ProxRank achieves significant speedups over existing methods while maintaining competitive retrieval performance on benchmark datasets. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ProxRank in various retrieval scenarios, including ad-hoc retrieval and diversity-aware retrieval.
