In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework, 'MAB-Agents', which leverages multi-armed bandits (MAB) to adaptively assign tasks to autonomous agents. We propose a novel MAB algorithm that incorporates agent-specific rewards, exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and communication constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that MAB-Agents outperforms traditional assignment methods in terms of task completion rate and agent utility, while tolerating agent failures and network partitions.
