High-dimensional data indexing is a crucial problem in various applications, including similarity search and nearest neighbor retrieval. Bloom filters have been widely used for this purpose, but their performance degrades significantly with increasing dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'Learned Bloom', which leverages machine learning techniques to optimize the construction of Bloom filters for high-dimensional data. Our method uses a neural network to learn a compact representation of the data, which is then used to construct a Bloom filter that minimizes false positives. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Learned Bloom outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques, achieving up to 3x faster query times and 2x better accuracy.
