Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to provide immersive and engaging experiences for users with motor disabilities. However, traditional controllers can be challenging for individuals with limited dexterity or mobility. This study investigates the usability and accessibility of gestural interfaces in VR for users with motor disabilities. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, comparing a gestural interface to traditional controller-based interaction. Results show that gestural interfaces can significantly reduce interaction time and improve user satisfaction, especially for users with severe motor impairments. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of inclusive VR experiences.
