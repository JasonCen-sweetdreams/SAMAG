Distributed systems often face the challenge of efficient resource allocation, which can be exacerbated by the lack of coordination among autonomous agents. This paper presents a novel decentralized coordination framework, 'Agent Harmony', that enables agents to dynamically adjust their resource allocation strategies based on real-time system conditions. Our approach leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning and graph-based modeling to optimize resource utilization. Experimental results on a simulated cloud computing environment demonstrate that Agent Harmony outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods, achieving up to 25% improvement in resource efficiency and 30% reduction in latency.
