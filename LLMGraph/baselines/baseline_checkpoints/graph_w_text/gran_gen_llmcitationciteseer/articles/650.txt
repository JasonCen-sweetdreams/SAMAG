Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing complex relationships between data entities. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck, particularly for large-scale graphs. This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing query performance using learned index structures. We propose a deep learning-based method to predict the optimal index configuration for a given query workload, leveraging graph neural networks to capture structural patterns in the data. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate significant improvements in query response times, outperforming traditional indexing techniques by up to 3x.
