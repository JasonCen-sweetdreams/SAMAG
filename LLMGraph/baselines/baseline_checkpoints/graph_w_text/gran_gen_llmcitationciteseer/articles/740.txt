Individuals with motor impairments face significant barriers when interacting with digital systems. This paper presents a novel approach to designing adaptive gesture-based interfaces that accommodate diverse motor abilities. Our framework, ' GestureFit', utilizes machine learning-based gesture recognition and real-time adaptation to adjust interface parameters, such as gesture complexity and timing, to individual users' motor capabilities. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in interaction accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional gesture-based interfaces.
