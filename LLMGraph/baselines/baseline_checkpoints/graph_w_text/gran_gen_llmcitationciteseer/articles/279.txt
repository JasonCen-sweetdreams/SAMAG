Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have shown promise in mental health support, but their emotional expressions can significantly impact user trust and engagement. This paper presents an ECA framework that incorporates emotion regulation mechanisms, enabling the agent to recognize and adapt to users' emotional states. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, demonstrating that our ECA's empathetic responses and emotional regulation strategies improve user self-disclosure and perceived support. The findings have implications for the design of ECAs in mental health interventions, highlighting the importance of emotional intelligence in human-agent interaction.
