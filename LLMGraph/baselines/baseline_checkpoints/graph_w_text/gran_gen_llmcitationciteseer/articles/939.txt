Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that selectively focuses on relevant modalities and emotion cues to improve recognition accuracy. Our HAN model consists of a multi-modal fusion layer, a modality attention module, and an emotion attention module. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.
