Recommendation systems have become increasingly important in various applications, but their scalability remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages the hierarchical structure of user-item interactions to improve recommendation accuracy and efficiency. Our HGAT model employs a dual-attention mechanism that captures both local and global dependencies in the graph, allowing it to effectively model complex relationships between users and items. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy, while reducing computational costs by up to 60%.
