Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and the need to minimize communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep reinforcement learning model that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving feedback in the form of execution times. Our approach is able to adapt to changing data distributions and workloads, and outperforms traditional optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
