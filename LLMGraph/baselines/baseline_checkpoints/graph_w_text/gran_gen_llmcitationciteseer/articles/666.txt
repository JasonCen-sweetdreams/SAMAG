Real-time data warehousing has become crucial for timely business insights, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', tailored for column-store databases. By leveraging column-level statistics and a cost-based optimization approach, ColOpt reduces query latency by up to 40% compared to traditional row-store optimization techniques. We also introduce a novel indexing scheme, 'ColIX', which further accelerates query execution by minimizing data access patterns. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate ColOpt's efficacy in supporting real-time analytics workloads.
