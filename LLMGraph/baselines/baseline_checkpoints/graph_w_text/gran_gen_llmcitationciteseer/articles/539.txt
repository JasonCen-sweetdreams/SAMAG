Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'RT-Hybrid', that leverages the strengths of both column-store and row-store indexing techniques. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that dynamically selects the most efficient indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world data warehousing benchmark demonstrate that RT-Hybrid achieves an average query performance improvement of 3.2x compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
