Skeleton-based action recognition has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to capture human movements. However, existing methods often fail to effectively model the complex relationships between body joints. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) that learns to focus on relevant joints and their relationships at multiple scales. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets, including NTU-RGBD and Kinetics-Skeleton. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN in real-world applications, such as human-computer interaction and healthcare monitoring.
