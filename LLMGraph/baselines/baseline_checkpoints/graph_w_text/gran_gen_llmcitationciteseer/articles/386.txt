Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates neural embeddings with traditional query expansion techniques. Our method, dubbed 'EmbEx', learns dense vector representations of query terms and documents, which are then used to identify latent semantic clusters. These clusters are subsequently leveraged to generate expanded query terms that better capture the information need. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that EmbEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
