Generating coherent and engaging dialogue responses remains a challenging task in conversational AI. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that models dialogue context and user preferences to produce more relevant and explainable responses. Our HAN framework consists of a dialogue encoder, a user preference encoder, and a response generator, which jointly learn to identify salient context and preference features. We evaluate our approach on the OpenSubtitles and Ubuntu Dialogue datasets, demonstrating improved response quality and explainability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
