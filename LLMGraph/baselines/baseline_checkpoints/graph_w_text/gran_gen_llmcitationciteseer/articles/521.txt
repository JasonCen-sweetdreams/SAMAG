Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods often struggle to capture the nuanced semantics of user queries. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages context-aware semantic embeddings to enrich query representations. We introduce a graph-based model that incorporates both local and global context, enabling more accurate identification of relevant terms and expansion of the query scope. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for complex, multi-faceted queries.
