Distributed databases have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and provide high availability. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the database as a graph, where nodes represent tables and edges represent joins. Our GNN-based optimizer, 'GQO', learns to predict the optimal execution plan for a given query by iteratively refining the graph representation. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate that GQO outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
