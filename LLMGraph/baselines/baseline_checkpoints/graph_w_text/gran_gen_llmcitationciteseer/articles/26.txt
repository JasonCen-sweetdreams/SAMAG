Deep web databases pose significant challenges for information retrieval (IR) systems due to their large scale, heterogeneity, and limited accessibility. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) framework that leverages both semantic and structural knowledge to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of retrieval in deep web databases. HQE incorporates a multi-layered representation of queries and documents, enabling the identification of relevant terms and phrases at different levels of abstraction. Experimental results on a large-scale deep web dataset demonstrate that HQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval accuracy and response time.
