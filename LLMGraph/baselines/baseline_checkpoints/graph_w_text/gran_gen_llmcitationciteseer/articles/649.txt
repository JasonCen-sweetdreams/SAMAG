Traditional neural networks rely on static architectures and weights, limiting their adaptability to evolving cyber threats. This paper introduces a novel self-modifying neural network (SMNN) framework that dynamically reconfigures its architecture and weights in response to real-time input data. Our approach leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the SMNN's modification policy, enabling it to detect anomalies more effectively and efficiently than state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on a large-scale network intrusion dataset demonstrate the SMNN's superiority in detecting zero-day attacks and reducing false positives.
