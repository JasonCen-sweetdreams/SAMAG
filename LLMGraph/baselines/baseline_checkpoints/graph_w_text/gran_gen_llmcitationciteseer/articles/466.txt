Skeleton-based human action recognition has garnered significant attention in recent years, owing to its applications in fields like healthcare, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture for skeleton-based action recognition. HGAT integrates graph attention mechanisms at multiple scales to effectively capture spatiotemporal dependencies in human skeleton data. Experimental results on the NTU-RGB+D and Kinetics-Skeleton datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improved recognition accuracy and robustness to noise and occlusion.
