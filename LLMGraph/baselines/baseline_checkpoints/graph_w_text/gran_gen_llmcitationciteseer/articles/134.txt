As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, ensuring secure authentication mechanisms is crucial. This paper investigates the efficacy of gesture-based authentication in VR environments. We designed a user study to evaluate the performance of a gesture-recognition system using a custom-built VR platform. Our results show that gesture-based authentication can achieve high accuracy (>90%) and robustness against spoofing attacks. We also identify key factors influencing user performance, including gesture complexity and feedback modalities. The findings of this study have implications for the development of secure and user-friendly authentication systems in VR applications.
