Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but its computational cost can be prohibitive for large document collections. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages the inherent structure of document clusters to reduce the number of expansion terms. Our method, dubbed 'HQE', uses a two-stage clustering process to identify relevant terms at multiple granularities, resulting in more accurate and efficient retrieval. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art expansion techniques in terms of both recall and query processing time.
