Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of marginalized user groups, such as individuals with disabilities or non-native language speakers. This paper presents a user-centered co-design approach to create more inclusive voice assistants. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with diverse user groups, resulting in a set of design principles and recommendations for more accessible and usable voice assistants. Our evaluation demonstrates that these design principles improve user satisfaction and task completion rates for marginalized users, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in HCI.
