Optimizing query execution plans is crucial for the performance of distributed database systems. Traditional approaches rely on hand-crafted heuristics or exhaustive search, which can be suboptimal and computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQOpt', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn query optimization policies. We design a custom neural network architecture that incorporates database schema and query workload information to generate optimized execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that DeepQOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
