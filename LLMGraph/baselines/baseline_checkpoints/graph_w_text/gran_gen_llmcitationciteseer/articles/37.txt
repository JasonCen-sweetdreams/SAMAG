In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'GraphAgent', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and task dependencies. GraphAgent enables agents to learn distributed representations of tasks and allocate them in a decentralized manner, without relying on a centralized controller. Our experiments demonstrate that GraphAgent outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency, while adapting to dynamic changes in the environment.
