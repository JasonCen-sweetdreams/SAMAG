Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but users with disabilities often face significant barriers to adoption. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the user experience of individuals with hearing, speech, and cognitive impairments interacting with voice assistants. We identify key challenges and propose a novel error recovery strategy, 'ReSpeak', which leverages multimodal feedback and adaptive prompting to improve user understanding and reduce frustration. Our results show significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in voice assistant development.
