Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it helps to alleviate the vocabulary mismatch problem between users' queries and relevant documents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid QE approach that leverages both word embeddings and dependency parsing to generate more effective expansion terms. Our approach, dubbed 'Hyb QE', first uses word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and candidate expansion terms. Then, it utilizes dependency parsing to identify the most informative expansion terms based on their syntactic roles in the query context. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Hyb QE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
