Neural ranking models have revolutionized information retrieval by leveraging deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of document retrieval. However, these models can be computationally expensive and require large amounts of training data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HierRank', which leverages a multi-level ranking strategy to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. HierRank combines the strengths of both lexical and semantic matching, and uses a novel attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant document regions. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models while reducing computational overhead by up to 40%.
