In decentralized multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. We propose a novel adaptive auction-based mechanism, 'AdaAuction', which enables agents to dynamically adjust their bidding strategies based on real-time observations of the environment. Our approach leverages a probabilistic graphical model to capture agent interactions and incorporates a feedback loop to refine task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that AdaAuction outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and system adaptability.
