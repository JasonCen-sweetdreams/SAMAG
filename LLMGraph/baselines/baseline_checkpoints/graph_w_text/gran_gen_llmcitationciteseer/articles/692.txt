Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in natural language processing and information retrieval, where the goal is to identify the correct entity reference in a given context. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages graph-based clustering and deep learning techniques to achieve scalable and accurate entity disambiguation. Our method first constructs a graph representation of the entities and their relationships, and then applies a deep clustering algorithm to group similar entities together. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
