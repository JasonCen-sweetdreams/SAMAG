In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages hybrid auction mechanisms to allocate tasks to agents. Our approach combines the benefits of combinatorial auctions and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves auctions to ensure efficient task allocation while minimizing communication overhead. We evaluate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and system efficiency compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
