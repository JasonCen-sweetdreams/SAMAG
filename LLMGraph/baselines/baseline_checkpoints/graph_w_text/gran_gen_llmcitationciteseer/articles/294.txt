Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in various applications, but their opacity hinders user trust and understanding. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that generates personalized recommendations while providing explicit explanations. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex item relationships and captures hierarchical representations of user preferences. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
