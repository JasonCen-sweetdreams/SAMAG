In cooperative multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks among agents in a distributed manner. Our method, called GNN-TA, represents the agent-task relationships as a graph and learns to predict the optimal task assignments based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. We evaluate GNN-TA on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate its superiority over traditional centralized and decentralized methods in terms of task completion rate, communication overhead, and adaptability to changing environments.
