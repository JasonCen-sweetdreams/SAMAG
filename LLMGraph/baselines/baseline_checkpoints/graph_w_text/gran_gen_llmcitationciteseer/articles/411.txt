Cloud computing platforms require efficient resource allocation to meet dynamic workload demands. This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'CloudAllocator', that allocates resources based on real-time usage patterns and provider constraints. Each agent learns to optimize its resource allocation policy using a novel hybrid Q-learning and graph neural network approach. Experimental results on a simulated cloud environment demonstrate that CloudAllocator outperforms traditional heuristic-based allocation methods, achieving up to 30% improvement in resource utilization and 25% reduction in request latency.
