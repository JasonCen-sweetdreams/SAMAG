This paper presents a novel decentralized multi-agent coordination framework for efficient resource allocation in autonomous systems. Our approach leverages a hybrid of distributed constraint optimization and deep reinforcement learning to enable agents to adaptively allocate resources in real-time. We introduce a novel communication protocol that enables agents to share information and coordinate their actions without reliance on a centralized controller. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements in resource utilization and overall system efficiency compared to traditional centralized methods.
