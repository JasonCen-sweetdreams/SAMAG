The advent of non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies has transformed the landscape of data warehousing. However, existing indexing schemes are often optimized for traditional storage media, leading to suboptimal performance in NVM-based systems. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'NVMIndex', which leverages the unique characteristics of NVM to achieve efficient data retrieval and insertion in real-time data warehousing. We introduce a hybrid indexing strategy that combines the benefits of tree-based and hash-based indexing, and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing schemes.
