Search result diversification is crucial for providing users with a comprehensive view of relevant information. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages query reformulation patterns to enhance search result diversification. We propose a probabilistic model that captures the relationships between query reformulations and their corresponding search results. Our approach is based on a graph-based ranking framework that incorporates both relevance and diversity metrics. Experimental results on a large-scale web search dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art diversification techniques, leading to a significant improvement in search result novelty and coverage.
