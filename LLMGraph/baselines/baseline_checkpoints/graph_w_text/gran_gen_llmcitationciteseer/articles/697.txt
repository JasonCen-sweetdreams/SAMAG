Gesture recognition systems have the potential to improve the quality of life for people with motor impairments. However, current systems often rely on able-bodied users' data, leading to poor performance and user experience for individuals with motor impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing adaptive gesture recognition systems that can accommodate diverse motor abilities. Our approach combines machine learning with participatory design, involving users with motor impairments in the design process. We evaluate our system with a case study involving users with cerebral palsy and demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction.
