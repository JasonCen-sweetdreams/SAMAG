Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, as it resolves ambiguity in entity references. This paper proposes a novel graph-based neural network approach, 'GED-GNN', that leverages both local and global structural information to disambiguate entities efficiently. Our model combines a graph attention mechanism with a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify clusters of similar entities. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that GED-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale knowledge graph construction.
