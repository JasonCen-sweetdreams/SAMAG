Conversational agents have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing systems often fail to account for the unique needs and challenges of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing accessible conversational agents that accommodate cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key design requirements, including simplified language processing, error tolerance, and personalized feedback mechanisms. Our prototype, 'CAREbot', was evaluated in a usability study with 20 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to a baseline agent.
