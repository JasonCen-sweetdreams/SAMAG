The advent of IoT and sensor networks has led to an explosion of high-throughput data streams, necessitating efficient real-time analytics. Existing indexing techniques struggle to cope with the velocity and volume of these streams. This paper presents 'FlashIndex', a novel in-memory indexing framework that leverages multi-core processors and hybrid storage architectures to achieve high-throughput and low-latency query performance. We introduce a hybrid indexing strategy that adaptively switches between disk-based and memory-based indexing based on data velocity and query patterns. Experimental results on a simulated IoT dataset demonstrate that FlashIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 5x in terms of query throughput and response time.
