Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NEQE', which leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. We explore the use of contextualized word representations and graph-based methods to generate a set of expanded queries that better match the user's information need. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that NEQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
