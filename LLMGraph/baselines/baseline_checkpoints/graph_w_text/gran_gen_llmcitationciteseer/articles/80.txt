Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but current interfaces often neglect the importance of embodied cognition. This paper investigates the role of gesture-based interaction in enhancing cognitive processing and user experience in VR. We designed an immersive VR environment that incorporates gesture recognition and haptic feedback, and conducted a user study to explore its effects on cognitive load, spatial awareness, and user engagement. Results show that gesture-based interaction significantly improves cognitive processing and user experience, suggesting a paradigm shift in VR interaction design.
