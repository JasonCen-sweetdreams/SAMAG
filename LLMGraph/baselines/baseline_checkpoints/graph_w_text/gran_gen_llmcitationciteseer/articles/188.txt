In distributed multi-agent systems, task allocation is a fundamental problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach based on distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to allocate tasks to agents in a robust and efficient manner. Our method leverages the agents' local knowledge and communication capabilities to iteratively refine task assignments, ensuring that global constraints are satisfied. Experiments on a simulated rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized algorithms in terms of solution quality and communication overhead.
