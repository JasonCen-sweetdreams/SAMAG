Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query optimization, leveraging the structural properties of query plans to identify efficient execution strategies. We introduce a graph neural network (GNN) model that learns to predict optimal query plans from a large dataset of query executions. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x while reducing query latency by 30%.
