Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck, especially for complex queries. This paper presents an adaptive indexing approach that dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distribution. Our approach, called 'AdapIndex', leverages machine learning-based prediction models to identify optimal index configurations for varying workloads. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AdapIndex achieves significant improvements in query latency and throughput compared to traditional static indexing techniques.
