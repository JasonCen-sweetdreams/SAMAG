Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', learns to select the optimal execution plan based on the system's current workload and resource utilization. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database and show that it outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
