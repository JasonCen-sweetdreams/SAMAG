In many real-world applications, tasks need to be allocated to agents with varying capabilities and rewards that change over time. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation algorithm, 'Tempo', which leverages a hybrid approach combining graph-based and reinforcement learning techniques. Tempo adapts to dynamic task rewards and agent capabilities, ensuring efficient and scalable coordination among agents. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that Tempo outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate and reward accumulation.
