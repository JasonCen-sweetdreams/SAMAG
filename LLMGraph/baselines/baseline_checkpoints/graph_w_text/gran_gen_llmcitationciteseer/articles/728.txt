Distributed databases have become increasingly common, but optimizing query execution remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy. Our approach, called 'DROPS', is able to adapt to changing workload patterns and database configurations. Experimental results on a realistic distributed database benchmark show that DROPS outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and resource utilization.
