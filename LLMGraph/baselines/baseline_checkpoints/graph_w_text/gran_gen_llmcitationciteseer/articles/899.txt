Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck in DDS. This paper proposes an adaptive partitioning strategy, 'APart', which dynamically re-partitions data based on query patterns and workload changes. APart leverages a novel cost model that considers both data distribution and query access patterns to optimize query performance. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that APart achieves an average query performance improvement of 30% compared to traditional fixed-partitioning schemes.
