In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism for distributed task allocation, where agents bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We introduce a truthful bidding strategy that incentivizes agents to reveal their true valuations, and develop a distributed auction protocol that converges to a near-optimal allocation. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving system-wide utility and reducing communication overhead.
