Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been increasingly used to support older adults in various tasks, but their impact on cognitive load is not well understood. This study investigates the effectiveness of ECAs in reducing cognitive load for older adults during a task-oriented conversation. We designed an ECA system that uses multimodal inputs and outputs to engage users in a conversational interface. Our results show that the ECA system significantly reduced cognitive load compared to a text-based interface, with participants reporting higher levels of trust and satisfaction. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of accessible and user-centered interfaces for older adults.
