Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop inclusive voice-based interfaces tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and clinicians to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our findings informed the development of a prototype system, 'EasyVoice', which incorporates features such as simplified syntax, personalized feedback, and cognitive support. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice-based interfaces.
