Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but existing VR interfaces often exclude users with disabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for designing inclusive accessibility features in VR, focusing on users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We propose a set of guidelines and heuristics for VR interface designers, based on a mixed-methods approach involving user studies, expert interviews, and iterative prototyping. Our evaluation shows that incorporating these accessibility features improves user experience and task performance for users with disabilities, while also enhancing overall usability for all users.
