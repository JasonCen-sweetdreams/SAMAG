Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) enables timely insights into rapidly changing data, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents 'SkewOPT', a novel optimization framework that tackles data skew in RTDW. SkewOPT leverages a probabilistic data distribution model to identify and mitigate skew-induced performance bottlenecks. Our approach incorporates a lightweight, online skew detection mechanism and a dynamic query rewriting strategy to minimize query latency. Experimental results on a real-world RTDW benchmark demonstrate that SkewOPT outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3.5x in terms of query response time.
