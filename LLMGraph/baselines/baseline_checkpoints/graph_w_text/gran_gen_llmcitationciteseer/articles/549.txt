Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture the semantic nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep semantic embeddings to enrich query representations. By injecting domain-specific knowledge into the embedding space, our method enables more accurate query expansion and improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of DeepQE in enhancing retrieval precision and recall, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
