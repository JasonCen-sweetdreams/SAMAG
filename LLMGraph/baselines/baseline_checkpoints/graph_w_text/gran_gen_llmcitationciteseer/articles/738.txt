Anomaly detection is critical for ensuring the reliability and security of Industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'IoT-AD', which leverages a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to detect anomalies in IIoT sensor data. IoT-AD incorporates a transfer learning scheme to adapt to new devices and environments, and a robust feature selection mechanism to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Experimental results on a real-world IIoT dataset demonstrate that IoT-AD outperforms traditional machine learning-based methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
