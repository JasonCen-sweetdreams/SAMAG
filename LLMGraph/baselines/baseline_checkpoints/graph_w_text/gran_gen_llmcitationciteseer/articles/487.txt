Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) to improve the recall of relevant documents. However, traditional query expansion methods often suffer from noise and ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our method, called HQE-NE, employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively expand the query terms based on their relevance and context. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQE-NE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness.
