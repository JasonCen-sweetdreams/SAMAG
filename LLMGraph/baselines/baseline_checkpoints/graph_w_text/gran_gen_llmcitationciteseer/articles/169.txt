Traditional query term weighting methods in information retrieval rely heavily on manually curated resources, such as thesauri or dictionaries. This paper presents an unsupervised approach to query term weighting, leveraging the underlying semantics of the document collection. Our proposed method, 'TermForge', employs a graph-based representation of the document term relationships, which is then utilized to derive a weighted query representation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that TermForge outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, particularly in scenarios with limited domain knowledge.
