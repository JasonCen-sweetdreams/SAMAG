In dynamic environments, autonomous agents often face unexpected task failures or changes in priority. This paper introduces a novel framework, 'Proactive Reallocation of Tasks' (PART), which enables agents to proactively reallocate tasks and adapt to changing circumstances. PART combines a predictive model with a distributed constraint optimization algorithm to identify and resolve potential task conflicts. Our experimental results demonstrate that PART significantly improves task completion rates and reduces idle time in simulated disaster response scenarios, compared to traditional reactive reallocation approaches.
