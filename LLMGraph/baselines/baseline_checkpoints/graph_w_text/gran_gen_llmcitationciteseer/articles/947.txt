As voice assistants become increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need to design more inclusive interfaces that cater to the diverse needs of older adults. This paper presents a multimodal interaction framework that integrates speech, gesture, and visual cues to facilitate more effective and accessible interactions. Our user-centered design approach involves a series of co-design workshops and usability studies with older adults, revealing key challenges and opportunities for inclusive design. We evaluate our framework through a controlled experiment, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction. This work contributes to the development of more accessible and user-friendly voice assistants for older adults.
