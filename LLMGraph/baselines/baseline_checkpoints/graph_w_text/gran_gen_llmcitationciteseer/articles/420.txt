Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing queries for multiple tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MTQO', which leverages machine learning to predict query performance and optimize resource allocation. MTQO introduces a tenant-aware cost model that considers both query complexity and resource contention, resulting in significant improvements in query response times and system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world cloud database show that MTQO outperforms existing optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of average query latency.
