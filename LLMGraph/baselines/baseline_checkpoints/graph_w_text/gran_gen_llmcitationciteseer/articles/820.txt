Short-text retrieval is a challenging task due to the limited context and ambiguity in user queries. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages the strengths of deep neural networks to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'QNLP', uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn a dense representation of query terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QNLP outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
