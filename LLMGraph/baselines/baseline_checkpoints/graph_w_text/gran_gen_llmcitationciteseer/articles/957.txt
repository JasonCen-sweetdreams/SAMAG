As the global population ages, there is a growing need to design interfaces that are accessible and usable by older adults. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction approach for conversational interfaces that combines speech, gesture, and gaze-based input. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults and found that our approach significantly improves interaction accuracy and reduces cognitive load compared to traditional speech-only interfaces. Our results also highlight the importance of personalized feedback and adaptive difficulty adjustment in promoting user engagement and confidence.
