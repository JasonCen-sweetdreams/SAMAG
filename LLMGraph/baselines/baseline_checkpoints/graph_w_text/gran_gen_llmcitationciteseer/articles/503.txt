Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in distributed database systems, as it enables accurate data integration and querying. However, existing approaches suffer from scalability issues, particularly in large-scale systems. This paper proposes a novel graph-based hashing approach for entity disambiguation, which leverages the structural properties of entity relationships to efficiently disambiguate entities. Our approach uses a distributed hash table to store entity representations, enabling fast lookup and disambiguation. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
