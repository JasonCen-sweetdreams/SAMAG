Ad-hoc search systems struggle to efficiently retrieve relevant documents for complex queries. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages both semantic and syntactic features to expand queries. HQE constructs a hierarchical representation of the query, where each level captures increasingly abstract concepts. We introduce a probabilistic model to estimate the relevance of expanded terms and a pruning strategy to reduce the search space. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HQE improves retrieval efficiency by 30% and mean average precision by 12% compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
