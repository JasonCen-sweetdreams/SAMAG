Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle with vocabulary mismatch between queries and documents. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, HDE-QE, which leverages hierarchical document embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. By recursively applying a graph-based clustering algorithm to the document embedding space, HDE-QE generates a hierarchical representation of the vocabulary. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that HDE-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 12.3% increase in mean average precision.
