In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that involves assigning tasks to agents to maximize efficiency and minimize conflicts. This paper proposes a distributed task allocation framework using reinforcement learning, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on its local observations and interactions with other agents. We introduce a novel reward function that encourages cooperation and fairness among agents, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulated environments. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent satisfaction.
