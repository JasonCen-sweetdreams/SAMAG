Conversational search systems aim to retrieve relevant documents by simulating human-like interactions. However, existing methods suffer from information scarcity and semantic mismatch between queries and documents. This paper presents a novel query-driven document expansion approach, 'QDE', which selectively injects relevant context into documents to enhance their retrieval likelihood. Our method leverages a combination of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features to identify expansion candidates and incorporates a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the expansion policy. Experimental results on a large-scale conversational search dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency using QDE.
