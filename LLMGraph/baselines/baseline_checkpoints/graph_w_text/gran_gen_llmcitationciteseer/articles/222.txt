In multi-agent systems, cooperative task allocation is crucial for achieving efficient and effective collaboration. This paper presents a novel approach to this problem using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized, multi-agent Q-network (MAQN) that learns to allocate tasks based on the agents' capabilities, task requirements, and environmental constraints. The MAQN is trained using a modified Q-learning algorithm that incorporates a novel reward function, encouraging cooperative behavior and adaptability to changing environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate, resource utilization, and adaptability to dynamic environments.
