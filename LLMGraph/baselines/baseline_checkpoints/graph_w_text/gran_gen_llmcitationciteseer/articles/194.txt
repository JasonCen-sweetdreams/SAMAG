This paper explores the design of conversational interfaces for older adults, with a focus on promoting inclusivity and accessibility. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, examining their interactions with existing chatbots and identifying pain points. Our findings highlight the importance of simplifying language, providing explicit feedback, and accommodating cognitive and motor impairments. We propose a set of guidelines for designing inclusive chatbots and demonstrate their efficacy through a prototype system. Our work contributes to the development of more accessible and usable conversational interfaces for older adults, enhancing their overall user experience.
