Recommendation systems often rely on complex models that are difficult to interpret, hindering user trust and understanding. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) architecture that generates explanations for recommendations. HAGNN incorporates node-level, graph-level, and hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture complex item relationships and user preferences. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.
