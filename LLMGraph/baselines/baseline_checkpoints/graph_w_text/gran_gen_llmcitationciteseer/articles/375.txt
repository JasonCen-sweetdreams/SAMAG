Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is a crucial task in various applications, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational costs, limited scalability, and inferior performance. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Contrastive Learning (HCL) framework, which leverages the strengths of self-supervised learning and hierarchical representations to detect anomalies efficiently. HCL learns a hierarchical representation of the time series data by minimizing a contrastive loss between positive and negative samples at multiple scales. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
