In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is a crucial task that enables agents to achieve common goals. However, in real-world scenarios, agents often have incomplete information about each other's capabilities, preferences, and intentions. This paper proposes a novel adaptive coalition formation algorithm that leverages probabilistic graphical models to reason about uncertain agent information. Our approach iteratively updates coalition structures based on observed agent behaviors, enabling more effective and resilient collaboration. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the improved performance of our algorithm compared to existing methods that assume complete information.
