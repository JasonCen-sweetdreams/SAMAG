The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of time series data, necessitating efficient anomaly detection methods to ensure network reliability and security. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'TS-Anomaly', which leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to identify anomalies in IoT time series data. We introduce a novel loss function that incorporates domain knowledge to improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that TS-Anomaly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and detection latency.
