Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has gained significant attention in recent years. However, the passage retrieval step remains a major bottleneck, with most state-of-the-art models relying on inefficient and computationally expensive methods. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Dense Passage Retrieval (HDPR), which leverages hierarchical dense representations to efficiently retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus. We demonstrate that HDPR achieves significant improvements in both retrieval efficiency and question answering accuracy on several benchmark datasets, including TriviaQA and Natural Questions.
