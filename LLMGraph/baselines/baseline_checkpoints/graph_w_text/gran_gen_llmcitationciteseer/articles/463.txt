Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a crucial component in various AI-driven natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, traditional KGE methods struggle to capture complex relationships and hierarchical structures in large-scale knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a novel KGE framework, 'HyperKGE', which leverages the expressive power of hyperbolic geometry to model complex relationships and scalable to large knowledge graphs. Experimental results on benchmarks such as WN18RR and FB15K-237 demonstrate that HyperKGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods in link prediction and entity disambiguation tasks, while reducing computational costs.
