In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that can significantly impact the overall system performance. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'SwarmAllocate', which leverages swarm intelligence principles to efficiently allocate tasks among agents. SwarmAllocate uses a novel pheromone-based communication mechanism to facilitate agent coordination, enabling the system to adapt to dynamic task arrivals and agent failures. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that SwarmAllocate outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and system robustness.
