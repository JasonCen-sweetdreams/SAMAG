As robots are increasingly integrated into industrial workflows, understanding the role of embodiment in human-robot collaboration is crucial. This study investigates how the physical presence of a robot, as opposed to a virtual or screen-based interface, influences human trust, communication, and task performance. We conducted a series of user studies in a simulated industrial setting, comparing human-robot collaboration with embodied and non-embodied robots. Our results show that embodied robots lead to higher trust and improved communication, but also introduce new challenges related to spatial awareness and navigation. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future human-robot collaboration systems.
