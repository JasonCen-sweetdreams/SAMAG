Emotion recognition from multi-modal data, such as speech, text, and vision, remains a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the heterogeneity of data sources. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages the strengths of graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model the intricate relationships between modalities. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CMU-MOSEI dataset, achieving an average F1-score of 0.83 across six emotions. We also provide insights into the learned attention patterns, revealing the importance of cross-modal interactions in emotion recognition.
