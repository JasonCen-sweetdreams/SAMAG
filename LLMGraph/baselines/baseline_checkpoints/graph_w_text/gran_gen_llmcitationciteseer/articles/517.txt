Dialogue state tracking (DST) is a crucial component of task-oriented dialogue systems, where the goal is to accurately track user goals and preferences across multiple turns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for DST, which leverages both local and global context to improve tracking performance. Our approach incorporates a multi-layer attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant dialogue history, enabling more accurate and interpretable state tracking. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and providing insights into the decision-making process.
