Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but existing systems often neglect the needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) that facilitate inclusive VR experiences. We develop a set of guidelines for creating ECAs that accommodate users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. Our approach involves a participatory design process, where users with disabilities co-create ECAs that cater to their specific needs. We evaluate our framework through a user study, demonstrating improved user engagement, satisfaction, and accessibility in VR environments.
