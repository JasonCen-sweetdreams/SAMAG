The increasing sophistication of malware has rendered traditional detection methods ineffective. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) for explainable AI-based malware detection. HGAT leverages graph neural networks to model the complex relationships between system calls and API calls, and incorporates attention mechanisms to focus on relevant features. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on the Malware Benchmark dataset, while providing interpretable explanations for the detected malware. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in identifying novel, zero-day malware samples.
