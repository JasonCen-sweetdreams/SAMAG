This paper presents a novel approach to document retrieval using sparse adaptive hashing (SAH). We propose a hashing framework that leverages the sparsity of document-term matrices to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. Our approach adaptively adjusts the hash functions based on the query distribution, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval efficiency. Experimental evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall, while reducing the computational overhead by up to 50%.
