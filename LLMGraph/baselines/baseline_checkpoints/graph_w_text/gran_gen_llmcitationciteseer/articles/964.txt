Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in many applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explanations for the detected outliers. Our approach consists of a hierarchical encoder that captures both local and global temporal patterns, followed by an attention-based anomaly scorer that highlights the most relevant features contributing to the anomaly. We evaluate HAN on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved detection performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
