Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are essential for efficiently searching large-scale document collections. However, the query latency in such systems remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, HI-DIR, which significantly reduces query processing time. HI-DIR partitions the document collection into a hierarchical structure, allowing for efficient query routing and reducing the number of nodes involved in query processing. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that HI-DIR outperforms state-of-the-art DIR systems, achieving an average query latency reduction of 35% while maintaining retrieval accuracy.
