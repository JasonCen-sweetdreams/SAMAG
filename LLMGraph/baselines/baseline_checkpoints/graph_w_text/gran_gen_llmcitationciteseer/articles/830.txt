Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in smart homes, but their usability and accessibility for older adults remain understudied. This paper presents a participatory design approach to designing voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults. We conducted co-design workshops with 15 older adults and 10 caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings highlight the importance of intuitiveness, feedback, and customization in voice assistant design. We propose a set of design guidelines and a prototype system that incorporates these principles, demonstrating significant improvements in usability and user experience for older adults.
