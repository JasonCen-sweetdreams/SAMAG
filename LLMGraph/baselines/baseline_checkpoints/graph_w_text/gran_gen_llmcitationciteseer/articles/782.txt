Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts performance and scalability. Traditional query optimizers rely on hand-crafted heuristics and rule-based systems, which often fall short in complex scenarios. This paper presents 'QOptRL', a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to learn efficient query plans from experience. We formulate query optimization as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn optimal query plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database demonstrate that QOptRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
