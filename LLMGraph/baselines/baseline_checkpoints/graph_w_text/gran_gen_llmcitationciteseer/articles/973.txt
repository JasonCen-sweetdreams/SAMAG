Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization in distributed databases. We model the query plan as a graph and employ graph neural networks to learn the optimal query execution plan. Our approach considers various factors such as data distribution, network latency, and node capacities to minimize query execution time. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
