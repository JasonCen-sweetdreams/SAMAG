This study investigates the impact of multimodal feedback on motor skill learning in virtual reality (VR)-based stroke rehabilitation. We designed a VR system that provides users with real-time auditory, visual, and haptic feedback on their movement performance. A user study with 24 stroke patients showed that the multimodal feedback condition resulted in significant improvements in movement accuracy and smoothness compared to a unimodal feedback condition. Our results suggest that incorporating multiple feedback modalities can enhance the effectiveness of VR-based rehabilitation and provide insights for the design of future VR systems.
