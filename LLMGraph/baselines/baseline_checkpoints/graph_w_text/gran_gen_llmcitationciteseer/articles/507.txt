Gesture recognition systems have transformed human-computer interaction, but existing systems often fail to accommodate the unique needs and abilities of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to develop an inclusive gesture recognition system, tailored to the motor and cognitive abilities of older adults. Our user-centered design process involved co-design workshops with 20 older adults, resulting in a novel gesture set that reduces error rates by 35% compared to commercial systems. We also propose a machine learning-based classifier that incorporates age-related factors, achieving an accuracy of 92.5% in recognizing gestures from older adults.
