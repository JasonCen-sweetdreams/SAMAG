Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) have been shown to be effective in personalized learning, but often struggle to adapt to individual students' abilities. This paper presents a novel gaze-guided approach to adaptive difficulty adjustment in ITSs. We develop a machine learning model that leverages gaze data from eye-tracking devices to infer a student's confidence and comprehension, and adjusts the difficulty of subsequent questions accordingly. Our user study with 40 students demonstrates that the proposed approach leads to improved learning outcomes, increased engagement, and reduced frustration. The results have implications for the design of more effective and human-centered ITSs.
