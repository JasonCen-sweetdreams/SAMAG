Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval accuracy. However, traditional query expansion methods rely on manual feature engineering and suffer from scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion framework, 'GraphQE', which leverages graph attention networks to model complex relationships between query terms and documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
