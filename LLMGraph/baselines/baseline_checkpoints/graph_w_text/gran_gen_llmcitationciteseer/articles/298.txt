E-commerce search engines face the challenge of retrieving relevant products from vast catalogs. Query expansion techniques can improve retrieval effectiveness, but often incur significant computational costs. This paper proposes a hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE', which leverages product category hierarchies to selectively expand queries. HQE combines a category-based query expansion method with a relevance-based filtering approach, reducing the number of expanded queries while maintaining retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency.
