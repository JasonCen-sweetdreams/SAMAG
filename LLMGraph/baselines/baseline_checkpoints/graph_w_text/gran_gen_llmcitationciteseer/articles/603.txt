In dynamic multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper introduces a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages hierarchical agent clustering to adapt to changing environmental conditions. We propose a clustering algorithm that groups agents based on their capabilities, spatial proximity, and task requirements. Our framework enables agents to dynamically adjust their cluster membership and allocate tasks using a decentralized, auction-based mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized task allocation approaches.
