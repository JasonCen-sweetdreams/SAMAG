Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck due to the high latency and overhead of distributed query execution. This paper proposes an adaptive caching framework, GraphCache, which dynamically adjusts the cache size and content based on query patterns and graph topology. We experimentally evaluate GraphCache on a real-world social network dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and throughput compared to existing caching strategies.
