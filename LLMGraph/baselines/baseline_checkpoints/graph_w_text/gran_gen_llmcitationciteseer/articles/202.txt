As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the factors that influence social presence in VR is crucial. This study investigates the role of embodiment in fostering social presence in VR. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, examining the effects of embodiment on social presence, self-report measures, and behavioral responses. Our results show that embodiment significantly enhances social presence, particularly when users can control their virtual bodies. We discuss the implications of our findings for VR-based social interactions and provide recommendations for designers and developers.
