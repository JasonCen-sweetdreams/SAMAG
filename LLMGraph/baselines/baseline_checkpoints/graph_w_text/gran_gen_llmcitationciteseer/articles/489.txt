Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a query. However, the performance of traditional methods degrades when dealing with ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel approach, HierGNN-QE, which leverages hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn contextualized representations of entities and expand queries. Our model incorporates a two-level hierarchy of GNNs, where the first level captures local entity relationships and the second level aggregates global context. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HierGNN-QE in improving entity disambiguation accuracy and reducing computational overhead.
