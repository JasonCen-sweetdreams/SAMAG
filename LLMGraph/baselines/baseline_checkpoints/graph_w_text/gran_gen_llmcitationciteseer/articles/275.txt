Query expansion is a crucial technique in ad-hoc retrieval, but its effectiveness is often hindered by the ambiguity of query terms. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages context-aware embeddings to disambiguate query terms and generate more informative expansion terms. Our method, ContextExp, incorporates a graph-based attention mechanism to capture the contextual relationships between query terms and their surrounding words. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that ContextExp significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving an average improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision.
