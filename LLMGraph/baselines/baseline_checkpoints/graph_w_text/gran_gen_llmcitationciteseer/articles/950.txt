The increasing adoption of Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems has led to a surge in sensor data, making it challenging to detect anomalies in real-time. This paper proposes a novel graph-based deep learning approach, 'GAD-IoT', which leverages the structural relationships between sensors to identify anomalies more accurately. GAD-IoT combines graph convolutional networks with a attention-based mechanism to capture complex patterns in sensor data. Experimental results on a real-world IIoT dataset demonstrate that GAD-IoT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and latency.
