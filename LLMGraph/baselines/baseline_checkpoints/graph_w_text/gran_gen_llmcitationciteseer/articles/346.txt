In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a novel approach to cooperative task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). Our algorithm, called CATS, leverages a hybrid search strategy that combines constraint propagation with stochastic optimization to efficiently explore the vast solution space. We evaluate CATS on a range of benchmark problems and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving near-optimal task allocations while minimizing communication overhead. The results show that CATS outperforms existing DCOP-based approaches in terms of solution quality and scalability.
