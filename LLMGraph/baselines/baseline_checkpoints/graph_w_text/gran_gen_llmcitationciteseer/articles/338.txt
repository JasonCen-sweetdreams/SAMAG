Query expansion is a crucial component in e-commerce search systems, as it can significantly improve the relevance and diversity of search results. However, existing query expansion techniques often suffer from high computational costs and limited coverage of relevant terms. This paper proposes a hybrid retrieval model, 'HybEx', that combines the strengths of lexical and semantic query expansion methods. HybEx employs a two-stage approach, where a lightweight lexical expansion module generates an initial set of expansion terms, which are then refined and weighted using a semantic module based on a pre-trained language model. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HybEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and query latency.
