Autonomous traffic management has emerged as a critical application domain for multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for adaptive traffic signal control. Our approach, 'TrafficMA', leverages graph neural networks to model complex traffic dynamics and enables agents to learn cooperative policies in a distributed manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TrafficMA in reducing congestion and improving travel times through extensive simulations on real-world traffic networks.
