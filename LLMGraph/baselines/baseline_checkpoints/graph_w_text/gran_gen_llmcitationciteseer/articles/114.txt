As urban populations grow, intelligent traffic management systems are crucial to alleviate congestion and reduce travel times. This paper presents a novel framework for coordinating autonomous agents in smart traffic management using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). Our approach, called 'SmartTraffic', employs a two-level hierarchy of agents: high-level agents optimize traffic signal control, while low-level agents adapt to local traffic conditions. We demonstrate the efficacy of SmartTraffic in a simulated urban network, achieving a 23% reduction in average travel time and a 17% decrease in congestion compared to traditional fixed-time traffic signal control.
