Malware detection is a critical task in cybersecurity, but existing methods often struggle with the complexity of modern malware variants. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAT-GNN) for malware detection. Our approach leverages graph-based representations of system call sequences to capture the structural patterns of malicious behavior. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant graph nodes and edges, improving the model's ability to generalize across diverse malware families. Experimental results on a large-scale malware dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HAT-GNN in detecting unknown malware, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline models.
