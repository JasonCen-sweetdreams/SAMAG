As autonomous agents proliferate in various domains, trust management becomes a critical concern. This paper presents a decentralized trust management framework, 'BlockTrust', that leverages blockchain technology to establish and maintain trust relationships among agents. BlockTrust enables agents to autonomously evaluate and update trust ratings based on their interactions, while ensuring transparency, integrity, and accountability. We evaluate BlockTrust using a simulated smart grid scenario, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and mitigating malicious agent behavior.
