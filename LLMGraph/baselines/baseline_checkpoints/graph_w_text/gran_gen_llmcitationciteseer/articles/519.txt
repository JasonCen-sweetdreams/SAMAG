Object detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicle systems, but current state-of-the-art models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and environmental variations. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between objects and scenes. HGAT integrates a hierarchical feature extractor with a graph attention module, enabling robust object detection in diverse scenarios. Experimental results on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms existing object detection models in terms of accuracy, robustness, and resilience to attacks.
