This paper proposes a novel decentralized agent coordination framework for dynamic task allocation in smart city applications. Our approach leverages a multi-agent system where agents represent autonomous entities, such as drones or robots, that can perform tasks like waste collection, surveillance, or package delivery. We introduce a distributed auction-based mechanism that enables agents to bid for tasks based on their capabilities, schedules, and preferences. Experiments in a simulated smart city environment demonstrate that our approach outperforms centralized task allocation methods in terms of response time, resource utilization, and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
