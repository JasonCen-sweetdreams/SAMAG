Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to accurately capture user intent, resulting in suboptimal query representations. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic query expansions. Our architecture combines a transformer-based query encoder with a dense passage retrieval module, enabling the model to identify relevant terms and phrases in the document collection. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
