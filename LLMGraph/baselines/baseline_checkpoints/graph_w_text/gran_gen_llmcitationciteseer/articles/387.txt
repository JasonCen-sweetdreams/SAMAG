Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning techniques to predict and optimize query execution plans. Our approach, called 'QueryOpt', uses a graph neural network to model the distributed database system and predict the optimal query plan based on historical query patterns and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that QueryOpt achieves an average query performance improvement of 23% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
