In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient assignment of tasks to agents with varying capabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn a decentralized task allocation policy. Our method, called GTA-Net, represents the agent-task graph as a neural network and uses graph attention mechanisms to learn the relationships between agents and tasks. We evaluate GTA-Net on a set of benchmark problems and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
