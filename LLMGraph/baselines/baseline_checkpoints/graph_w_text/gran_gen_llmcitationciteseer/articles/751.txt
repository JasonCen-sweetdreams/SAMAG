Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but its accessibility remains a significant concern for users with disabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces that cater to users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key accessibility barriers and developed a set of guidelines for creating adaptable VR interfaces. Our proposed framework is evaluated through a case study of a VR-based educational application, demonstrating improved usability and user experience for users with disabilities.
