With the exponential growth of digital data, efficient document retrieval has become a critical component of modern search engines. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages semantic knowledge graphs to disambiguate query terms and identify relevant documents. Our method, 'HQE-Graph', incorporates a two-stage expansion process that first identifies relevant entities and then generates a weighted set of expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC dataset demonstrate that HQE-Graph outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, particularly for complex, multi-entity queries.
