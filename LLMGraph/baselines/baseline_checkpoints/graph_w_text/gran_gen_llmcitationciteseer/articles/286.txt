Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but query processing remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'Distributed Hash Index' (DHI), which enables efficient query processing in distributed database systems. DHI leverages a combination of hash-based indexing and distributed data partitioning to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DHI outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and 25% in terms of system throughput.
