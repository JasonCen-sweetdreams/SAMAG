Neural ranking models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but they often require extensive computational resources and large amounts of training data. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to enrich the semantic representation of queries. Our method, called KGE-QE, uses a graph attention mechanism to select relevant entities and their relationships from a knowledge graph, and incorporates them into the query representation. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset show that KGE-QE improves the ranking performance of neural models, while reducing the computational overhead of query expansion.
