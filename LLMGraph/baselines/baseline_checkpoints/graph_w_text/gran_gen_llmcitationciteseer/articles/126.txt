Real-time analytics has become a crucial requirement in various industries, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. However, existing distributed database systems often struggle to provide low-latency query processing for complex analytical workloads. This paper proposes a novel optimization framework, 'Raptor', which leverages a combination of query rewriting, data partitioning, and parallel processing to accelerate query execution. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that considers both data distribution and query patterns to minimize query latency. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Raptor achieves up to 3x faster query processing compared to state-of-the-art distributed database systems.
