Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics workloads. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of distributed data storage and retrieval. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using learned indexes, which leverages machine learning techniques to predict the optimal query plan. Our approach, called 'LQE', uses a graph neural network to model the database schema and learn the relationships between tables, indexes, and queries. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that LQE outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and reduces optimization time by up to 5x.
