Autonomous vehicles rely on efficient and accurate object detection systems to ensure safety and reliability. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of YOLOv5 variants for real-time object detection in autonomous vehicles. We propose a novel approach, 'YOLOv5-Lite+', which reduces computational complexity by 30% while maintaining a high detection accuracy of 95.2% on the KITTI dataset. Our approach combines knowledge distillation, channel pruning, and spatial attention to optimize the model for real-time performance. We evaluate our approach on a diverse set of scenarios, including daytime, nighttime, and adverse weather conditions, and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the overall safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles.
