Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a crucial component in various AI applications, but their symbolic nature limits their ability to capture complex relationships and uncertainty. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for multi-relational KG embedding, which learns to selectively focus on relevant entities and relations at different abstraction levels. We evaluate HGAT on several popular KG benchmarks and demonstrate its superior performance in link prediction and entity classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods.
