Column-oriented NoSQL databases have gained popularity in big data analytics due to their ability to handle high-dimensional data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to identify optimal query plans. Our approach, called COOP, uses a combination of histogram-based statistical modeling and reinforcement learning to learn from query patterns and adapt to changing data distributions. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that COOP achieves up to 3x performance improvement over state-of-the-art query optimizers.
