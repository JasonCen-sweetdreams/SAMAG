This paper presents a novel decentralized multi-agent planning framework that leverages hierarchical task networks (HTNs) to coordinate complex tasks among agents. Our approach, called Dec-HTN, distributes planning responsibilities across agents, enabling them to reason about their local subtasks and communicate with neighboring agents to resolve dependencies. We prove the soundness and completeness of Dec-HTN and evaluate its performance in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved scalability and adaptability compared to centralized HTN-based planning.
