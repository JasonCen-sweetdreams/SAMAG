Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. Traditional query optimizers rely on heuristics and rules, which can lead to suboptimal plans. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RL-QOpt', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. We design a custom environment to model the query optimization problem and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy. Experimental results on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x on complex queries.
