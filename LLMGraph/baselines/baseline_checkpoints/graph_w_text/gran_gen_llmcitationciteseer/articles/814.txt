Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks, but their scalability and interpretability remain significant challenges. This paper proposes 'GraphExplainer', a novel GNN framework that leverages attention mechanisms and graph signal processing techniques to improve both scalability and interpretability. We introduce a hierarchical graph pooling strategy that reduces the computational complexity of GNNs while preserving node representations. Furthermore, we develop a feature importance metric that provides insights into the decision-making process of GraphExplainer. Experimental results on multiple real-world graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
