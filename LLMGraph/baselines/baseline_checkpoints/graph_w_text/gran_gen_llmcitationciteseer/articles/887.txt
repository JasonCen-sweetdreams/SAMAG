Deep transfer learning has become a dominant paradigm for few-shot image classification tasks. However, existing methods often rely on fixed prototype representations, which can be suboptimal for novel classes. This paper proposes an adaptive prototype refinement (APR) framework, which dynamically updates prototype representations based on the support set. Our APR approach leverages a meta-learning strategy to learn a robust prototype refinement function, which is then applied to the target classes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing few-shot learning approaches by a significant margin.
