The proliferation of multi-modal data, including images, videos, and sensor readings, has led to a surge in the development of multi-modal database systems. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the diverse characteristics of each modality. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MMO', which leverages a hybrid approach combining machine learning-based cost estimation with traditional optimization techniques. Our experiments on a real-world multi-modal dataset demonstrate that MMO achieves an average query performance improvement of 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods.
