Multi-agent planning has numerous applications in real-world domains, but the lack of transparency in decision-making processes hinders trust and adoption. This paper presents a novel approach to explainable multi-agent planning using Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs). We introduce a new HTN framework that integrates symbolic planning with probabilistic reasoning, enabling agents to generate hierarchical plans with explicit justifications. Our approach is evaluated on a set of benchmark problems, demonstrating improved explainability and plan quality compared to existing methods. The proposed framework has significant implications for the development of transparent and trustworthy AI systems in multi-agent settings.
