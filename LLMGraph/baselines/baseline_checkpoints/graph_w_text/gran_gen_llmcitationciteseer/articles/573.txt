This paper proposes a novel neural re-ranking approach for efficient document ranking in information retrieval. We introduce query-dependent contextualized embeddings, which capture the semantic relationships between queries and documents more effectively. Our method, dubbed QRN, leverages a deep neural network to learn a ranking function that incorporates these embeddings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QRN outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of ranking accuracy and query processing efficiency.
