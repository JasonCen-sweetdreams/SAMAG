Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but existing approaches often rely on manual feature engineering or simplistic term weighting schemes. This paper proposes a hierarchical neural query expansion framework, 'HierQE', which learns to jointly model query-document relationships and term correlations. Our approach leverages a novel tree-structured attention mechanism to identify salient query terms and expand them into a hierarchical representation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
