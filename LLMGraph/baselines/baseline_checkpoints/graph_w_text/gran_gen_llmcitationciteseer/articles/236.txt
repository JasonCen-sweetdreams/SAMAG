Node classification in large-scale social networks is a challenging task due to the complexity of graph structures and the scarcity of labeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages both local and global graph features to improve node classification accuracy. Our approach employs a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively selects relevant nodes and graph features at multiple scales, enabling the model to capture complex dependencies and relationships in the graph. Experimental results on several real-world social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in achieving state-of-the-art performance on node classification tasks.
