Passage retrieval is a crucial task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant passage from a document given a query. While traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and ranking models, we propose a deep neural network-based approach that learns to rank passages end-to-end. Our model, called PassageRank, employs a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural layers to capture both local and global contextual information in the passage. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that PassageRank outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
