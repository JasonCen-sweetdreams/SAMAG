In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant agent interactions to improve decision-making. By incorporating attention mechanisms at both local and global levels, HGAT provides interpretable insights into agent decision-making processes. We evaluate HGAT on a real-world autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in decision accuracy and explainability compared to existing graph-based methods.
