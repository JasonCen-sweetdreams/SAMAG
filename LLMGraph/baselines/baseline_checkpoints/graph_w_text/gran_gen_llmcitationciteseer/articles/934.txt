Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments face the challenge of coordinating their actions to achieve complex tasks. This paper presents a novel approach using Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) to coordinate multiple agents. We introduce a decentralized HTN framework that allows agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and task requirements. Our approach leverages a hybrid planning technique that combines symbolic and geometric reasoning to generate coordinated plans. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing agent collisions.
