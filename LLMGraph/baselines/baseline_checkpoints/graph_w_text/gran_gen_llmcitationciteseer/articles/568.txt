Virtual reality (VR) games often struggle to balance challenge and engagement, leading to player frustration or boredom. This paper presents 'GazeAdapt', a novel system that leverages eye-tracking and machine learning to adapt game difficulty in real-time based on the player's gaze behavior. Our approach detects cognitive load and emotional states from gaze patterns, adjusting game mechanics to optimize the player's experience. A user study with 30 participants shows that GazeAdapt significantly improves player satisfaction and reduces frustration compared to traditional, fixed-difficulty games.
