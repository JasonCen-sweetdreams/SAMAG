Traditional information retrieval systems struggle to effectively retrieve documents from heterogeneous networks, where documents and queries exhibit diverse structures and relationships. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'HetRank', that leverages graph neural networks to learn representations of documents and queries in a unified vector space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HetRank on a large-scale dataset of academic papers, showing significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
