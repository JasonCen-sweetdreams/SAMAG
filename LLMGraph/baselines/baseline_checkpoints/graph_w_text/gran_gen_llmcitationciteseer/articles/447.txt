Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their accessibility for people with disabilities remains a significant concern. This paper presents an emotion-aware conversational interface, 'EmpathyChat', designed to accommodate users with disabilities. We incorporate affective computing techniques to detect and respond to users' emotions, and develop a personalized interaction model that adapts to individual communication preferences. A user study with 30 participants with disabilities demonstrates that EmpathyChat significantly improves user satisfaction and reduces anxiety compared to traditional conversational interfaces.
