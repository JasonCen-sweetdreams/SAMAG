Distributed database systems are increasingly used to manage large-scale data sets, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel adaptive data partitioning strategy, called ADAPT, which dynamically adjusts data distribution based on query patterns and workloads. ADAPT leverages a cost-based optimization framework to identify the most effective partitioning scheme, taking into account factors such as data locality, node capacity, and network latency. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that ADAPT outperforms existing static partitioning methods, achieving an average query performance improvement of 35%.
