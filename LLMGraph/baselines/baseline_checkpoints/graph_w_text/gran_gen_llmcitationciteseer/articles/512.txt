Large-scale information retrieval (IR) systems require efficient document indexing methods to facilitate fast query processing. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach, 'HierIndex', which leverages the inherent structure of document collections to reduce indexing time and memory requirements. By recursively applying a density-based clustering algorithm, HierIndex creates a hierarchical index that adapts to the varying densities of the document space. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierIndex achieves significant speedups over traditional indexing methods while maintaining retrieval accuracy.
