Virtual reality (VR) systems often rely on manual controllers or voice commands, which can be cumbersome and detract from the immersive experience. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction system for VR, leveraging deep learning techniques to accurately predict user intent from eye movements. Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) to analyze gaze patterns and classify user actions. We evaluate our system using a custom-built VR platform and demonstrate significant improvements in interaction accuracy and user experience compared to traditional methods.
