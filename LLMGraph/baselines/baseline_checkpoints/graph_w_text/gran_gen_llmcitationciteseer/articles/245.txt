This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision making. Our approach enables agents to selectively focus on relevant communication messages and reasoning patterns, leading to improved decision-making outcomes and increased transparency. We evaluate our HAN framework on a benchmark multi-agent cooperative navigation task and demonstrate significant performance gains over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we provide visualizations of attention weights to facilitate understanding of the agents' decision-making processes.
