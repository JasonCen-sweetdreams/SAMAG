Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments require effective negotiation strategies to achieve their goals. This paper presents a novel adaptive negotiation framework, 'AdaNeg', which utilizes reinforcement learning to adapt to changing environmental conditions and agent interactions. We introduce a hierarchical negotiation strategy that integrates game-theoretic analysis with machine learning-based opponent modeling. Experimental results in a simulated robotic soccer domain demonstrate that AdaNeg outperforms state-of-the-art negotiation strategies in terms of goal achievement and adaptability to environmental changes.
