Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various information retrieval tasks. However, their effectiveness often relies on the quality of the input queries. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using pseudo-relevance feedback, which leverages the relevance signals from top-ranked documents to iteratively refine the query representation. We propose a neural architecture that incorporates a feedback module, which adaptively weights the importance of each feedback document to generate a more informative query expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the retrieval performance of neural models, outperforming existing query expansion techniques.
