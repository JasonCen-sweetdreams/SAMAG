Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale graph data, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization approach using reinforcement learning. Our method, called GraphQLearner, learns to select efficient query execution plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query latency. We evaluate GraphQLearner on three real-world graph datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers. Our results show that reinforcement learning can be effectively applied to distributed graph databases, leading to better query performance and scalability.
