Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular in modern data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and network communication. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called QOptRL, learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database's current state and the query's characteristics. We demonstrate that QOptRL outperforms traditional query optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization, making it a promising solution for large-scale distributed databases.
