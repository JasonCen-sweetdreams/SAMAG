Time series data has become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. However, traditional clustering algorithms struggle to handle large-scale time series data due to high dimensionality and complexity. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach, 'DeepHCT', which leverages deep metric learning to learn a hierarchical representation of time series data. We introduce a novel triplet loss function that encourages the clustering model to learn a hierarchical structure, resulting in improved clustering quality and scalability. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepHCT in comparison to state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.
