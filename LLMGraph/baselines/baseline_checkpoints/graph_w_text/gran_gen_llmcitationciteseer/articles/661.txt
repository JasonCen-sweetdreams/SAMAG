Optimizing SQL queries is a crucial task in relational databases, as it significantly impacts query performance. Existing optimization techniques rely on hand-crafted heuristics or exhaustive search, which can be inefficient and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQOpt', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query optimization policy. Our method uses a graph neural network to represent the query plan space and a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on a diverse set of benchmark queries demonstrate that DeepQOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x over the baseline.
