Cooperative multi-agent systems have numerous applications in real-world domains such as robotics, smart cities, and disaster response. However, efficient task allocation in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn optimal allocation strategies. Our approach, 'MA-RL-TA', uses a multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to adapt to dynamic task requirements and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that MA-RL-TA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
