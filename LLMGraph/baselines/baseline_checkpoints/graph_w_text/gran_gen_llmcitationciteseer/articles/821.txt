This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural document ranking model, HierRank, that leverages query reformulation to improve the efficiency of information retrieval systems. HierRank consists of a query reformulation module that generates a set of relevant sub-queries, and a hierarchical ranking module that learns to rank documents based on the original query and its sub-queries. We demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models on several benchmark datasets, while reducing the average query latency by 30%. Our analysis shows that the query reformulation module effectively captures the nuances of user queries, leading to improved ranking performance.
