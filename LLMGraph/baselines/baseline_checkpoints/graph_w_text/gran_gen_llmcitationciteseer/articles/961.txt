Effective task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities and constraints need to collaborate to achieve complex goals. This paper proposes a novel approach based on deep reinforcement learning, which learns to allocate tasks to agents by modeling their interactions and optimizing a global reward function. We introduce a hierarchical framework that combines a centralized planner with decentralized agent controllers, enabling efficient and adaptive task allocation in dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over traditional methods in various scenarios, including robotic search and rescue missions.
