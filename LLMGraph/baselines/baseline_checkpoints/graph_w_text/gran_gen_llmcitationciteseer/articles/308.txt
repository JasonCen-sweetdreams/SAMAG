Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face challenges in efficiently routing queries to relevant nodes. This paper proposes an adaptive routing framework, 'ARIA', which leverages node expertise and query characteristics to optimize query routing. ARIA incorporates a probabilistic modeling approach to estimate node expertise and adaptively adjusts routing decisions based on query feedback. Experimental results on a large-scale DIR system demonstrate that ARIA reduces average query latency by 37% and improves retrieval accuracy by 12% compared to state-of-the-art routing methods.
