Node clustering is a fundamental task in graph analysis, but existing methods often struggle with scalability and accuracy. This paper proposes Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively aggregate node features at multiple scales. By hierarchically applying attention to graph neighborhoods, HGAT efficiently identifies densely connected clusters while preserving node-level information. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art clustering methods in terms of clustering quality and computational efficiency.
