This paper presents the design and evaluation of a novel accessibility widget framework tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study, involving 30 participants with mild cognitive impairment, to identify key challenges and preferences in interacting with digital interfaces. Our framework, 'CognitiveEase', incorporates personalized adaptations, such as simplified layouts, enlarged icons, and audio cues, to facilitate intuitive navigation and reduce cognitive load. A usability evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to standard interface designs.
