Edge AI applications require efficient and adaptable neural networks to operate in dynamic environments. This paper introduces SelfModNet, a novel neural architecture that enables self-modification of its weights and structure based on runtime feedback. SelfModNet leverages a meta-learning approach to adapt to changing input distributions, noise patterns, and resource constraints. Our experiments on edge AI benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency compared to traditional static neural networks. We also explore the potential of SelfModNet for real-world applications, including autonomous vehicles and smart surveillance systems.
