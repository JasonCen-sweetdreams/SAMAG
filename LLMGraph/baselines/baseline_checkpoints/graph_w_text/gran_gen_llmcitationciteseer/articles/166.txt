The proliferation of big data has led to a surge in large-scale document retrieval systems. However, traditional indexing techniques struggle to efficiently process complex queries. This paper presents a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'HybridIX', which combines the strengths of inverted indexing and caching. HybridIX adaptively allocates index resources based on query patterns and document popularity, resulting in significant improvements in query latency and throughput. Experimental evaluations on a 100-million-document corpus demonstrate that HybridIX outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3.5x.
