Modern search engines often struggle to provide diverse search results, particularly when dealing with ambiguous queries. This paper presents a novel approach that jointly addresses entity disambiguation and query expansion to improve search result diversification. Our proposed framework, 'DivEx', leverages a graph-based entity disambiguation method to identify relevant entities and then expands the query using a contextualized language model. Experimental results on the TREC 2020 dataset show that DivEx significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of search result diversity and relevance.
