Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel relevance modeling approach that leverages deep semantic embeddings to enhance query understanding. We propose a neural network architecture that jointly learns term embeddings, document representations, and relevance scoring functions. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, with our approach outperforming state-of-the-art models by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
