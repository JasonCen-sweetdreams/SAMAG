Distributed column-store databases have emerged as a prominent solution for big data analytics, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', that leverages column-store statistics and parallel processing to improve query execution times. We propose a cost-based optimization algorithm that takes into account data distribution, column correlations, and available computational resources. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time, while maintaining a low optimization overhead.
