Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must coordinate to accomplish complex tasks without a central authority. This paper proposes a novel approach using hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to learn decentralized task allocation policies. Our method leverages the hierarchical structure of task graphs to learn both local and global dependencies between tasks, enabling agents to make informed decisions in a distributed manner. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving near-optimal solutions while minimizing communication overhead.
