The proliferation of edge devices has created a pressing need for efficient neural networks that can operate within tight resource constraints. This paper proposes a novel neural architecture search (NAS) framework, 'EdgeNAS', designed specifically for resource-constrained edge devices. EdgeNAS employs a multi-objective search strategy that balances model accuracy, latency, and energy consumption. Our experiments on several edge datasets demonstrate that EdgeNAS discovers models that outperform state-of-the-art NAS methods while satisfying stringent resource constraints, making it an attractive solution for real-time edge AI applications.
