Optimizing query performance is crucial in data warehousing, especially when dealing with large, multi-dimensional datasets. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using genetic algorithms (GAs). We propose a chromosome representation that encodes query execution plans and develop a custom crossover operator that leverages query plan similarities. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our GA-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers, achieving an average query execution time reduction of 23.4%. Our approach is particularly effective for complex queries involving multiple joins and aggregations.
