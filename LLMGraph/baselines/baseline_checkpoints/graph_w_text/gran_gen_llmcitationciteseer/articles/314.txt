Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle with query ambiguity and limited context. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'ConEx', which leverages deep learning-based contextual embeddings to model complex relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Our method incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to weigh the importance of contextual clues and a graph-based algorithm to efficiently expand the query. Experimental results on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries with ambiguous meanings.
