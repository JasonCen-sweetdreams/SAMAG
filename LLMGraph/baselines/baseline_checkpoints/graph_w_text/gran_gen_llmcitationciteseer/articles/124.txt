In multi-agent systems, conflicts between agents can lead to suboptimal performance and instability. This paper proposes a novel graph-based reinforcement learning approach to deconfliction, where agents learn to negotiate and resolve conflicts in a decentralized manner. We model the conflict resolution process as a graph-based Markov decision process and develop a reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages graph neural networks to learn effective deconfliction strategies. Experimental results on a simulated air traffic control scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing conflicts and improving overall system performance.
