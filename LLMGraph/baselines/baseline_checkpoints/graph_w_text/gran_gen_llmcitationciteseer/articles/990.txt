Virtual reality (VR) interfaces have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience in VR. We conducted a user study with 100 participants, using a novel avatar customization system that incorporates facial recognition and machine learning-based personality inference. Our results show that personalized avatars lead to increased user satisfaction, reduced cognitive load, and improved task performance. We also identify key design factors that influence user avatar attachment and discuss implications for VR interface design.
