Node classification in dynamic graphs is a challenging task due to the complexity of node interactions and graph evolution. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attentional graph neural network (HAGNN) architecture, which leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and temporal information. Our model consists of a node-level attention module, a graph-level attention module, and a hierarchical fusion layer to capture both local and global graph structures. Experimental results on several real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks, particularly in scenarios with rapid graph changes.
