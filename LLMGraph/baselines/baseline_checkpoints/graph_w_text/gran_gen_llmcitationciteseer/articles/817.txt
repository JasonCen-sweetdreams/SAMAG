Knowledge graph retrieval tasks often struggle with sparse entities, which lack sufficient descriptive information. This paper proposes a novel deep query expansion approach, 'DQE-KG', to enhance the retrieval of sparse entities. DQE-KG leverages a transformer-based architecture to generate semantically rich query expansions, incorporating entity relationships and type information. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that DQE-KG outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 15% in terms of mean reciprocal rank, especially for sparse entities with limited context.
