The increasing demand for real-time analytics in modern applications has led to a surge in distributed database systems. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution, network latency, and dynamic workloads. This paper presents 'Aurora', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and online learning techniques to adapt to changing system conditions. Aurora uses a multi-armed bandit approach to dynamically select the most efficient query plan, taking into account query patterns, data locality, and system resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that Aurora achieves up to 3x improvement in query response times compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
