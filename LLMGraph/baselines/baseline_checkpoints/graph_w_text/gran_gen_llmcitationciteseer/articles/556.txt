Distributed resource allocation is a complex problem that arises in many real-world applications, such as cloud computing, smart grids, and logistics. This paper proposes a cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'CoRAL', that enables agents to learn optimal resource allocation strategies in a decentralized manner. We introduce a novel distributed Q-learning algorithm that incorporates communication and coordination mechanisms among agents, allowing them to adapt to changing environmental conditions and optimize overall system performance. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that CoRAL outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of efficiency, fairness, and robustness.
