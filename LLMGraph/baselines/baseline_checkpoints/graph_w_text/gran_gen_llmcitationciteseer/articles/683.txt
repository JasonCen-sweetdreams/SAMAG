Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but still suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, DeepHash, which leverages deep semantic hashing to generate latent semantic representations of query terms. Our approach learns to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms and documents, enabling more effective query expansion. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that DeepHash significantly improves retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion methods, while reducing computational overhead.
