The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has created a need for efficient task allocation mechanisms that can adapt to dynamic environments. This paper presents a novel agent-based framework, 'DynaTA', which leverages decentralized decision-making to allocate tasks to IoT devices. We propose a hybrid approach that combines multi-agent systems with graph-based optimization techniques to minimize latency and energy consumption. Simulation results show that DynaTA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of scalability, flexibility, and robustness, making it suitable for real-world IoT applications.
