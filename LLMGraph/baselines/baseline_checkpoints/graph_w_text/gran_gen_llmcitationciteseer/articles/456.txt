Recommender systems are widely used in various applications, but their black-box nature hinders user trust and understanding. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that provides explainable recommendations by capturing complex item relationships and user preferences. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify influential items and users, and generates personalized explanations for each recommendation. Our experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality, while providing insights into the decision-making process.
