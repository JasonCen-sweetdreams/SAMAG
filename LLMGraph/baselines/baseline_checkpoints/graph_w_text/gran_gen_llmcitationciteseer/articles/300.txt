Real-time search engines often suffer from document redundancy, leading to decreased user satisfaction and increased computational costs. This paper proposes a novel time-aware latent semantic analysis (TALSA) approach to reduce redundancy in search results. By incorporating temporal features into the latent semantic space, TALSA captures the evolution of topics over time and identifies redundant documents more effectively. Experimental results on a large-scale news dataset demonstrate that TALSA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reducing redundancy while maintaining search relevance.
