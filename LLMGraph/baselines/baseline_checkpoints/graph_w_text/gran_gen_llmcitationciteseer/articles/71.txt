Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their user experience is often limited by the quality of synthetic speech. This paper presents an empirical study on the impact of synthetic speech on user experience, focusing on users with disabilities. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, using a custom-built voice assistant with varying levels of speech naturalness. Our results show that users with disabilities prefer more natural speech, but also value customizability and adaptability in voice assistants. We propose a set of design recommendations for creating more inclusive voice assistants, emphasizing the need for user-centered design and speech personalization.
