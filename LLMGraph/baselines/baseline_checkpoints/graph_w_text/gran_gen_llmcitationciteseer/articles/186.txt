Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing query performance for diverse workloads remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'DeepQuery', a novel query optimization framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workload patterns. Our approach uses a hierarchical neural network to learn the optimal query plan from a large search space, considering various performance metrics and resource constraints. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database system demonstrate that DeepQuery outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3.5x in terms of average query response time.
