Time series forecasting has numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and climate modeling. However, the lack of transparency in black-box models hinders their adoption in high-stakes domains. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant temporal and feature-wise dependencies in multivariate time series data. Our approach yields state-of-the-art forecasting performance while providing inherent interpretability through attention weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN on several benchmarks, including stock prices, weather patterns, and disease prevalence, and show that it outperforms existing explainable models.
