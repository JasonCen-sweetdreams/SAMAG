Traditional information retrieval systems rely on keyword-based matching, which often fails to capture semantic relationships between documents. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HierGNN-IR', that leverages hierarchical graph neural networks to learn document representations. By modeling documents as nodes in a graph, we can capture complex semantic relationships and retrieve documents that are semantically similar to a query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierGNN-IR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
