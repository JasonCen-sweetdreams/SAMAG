Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex data relationships. However, query processing remains a significant bottleneck due to the inherent complexity of graph traversals. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, GraphAxis, which leverages a combination of graph summarization and axis-based partitioning to accelerate query execution. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that adaptively selects the most efficient indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distributions. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphAxis outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in query response time.
