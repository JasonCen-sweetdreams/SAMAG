Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in modern data management systems. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for query optimization in distributed databases. We model the database as a graph and leverage graph algorithms to identify optimal query execution plans. Our approach reduces the query optimization time by up to 50% compared to traditional methods, while maintaining comparable query performance. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in various distributed database settings.
