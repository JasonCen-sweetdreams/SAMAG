Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing queries for diverse workloads and tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for multi-tenant databases. Our proposed framework, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan selection policy based on various performance metrics and tenant-specific characteristics. Experimental results on a real-world cloud database workload demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms traditional heuristics-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
