This paper presents a novel approach to document re-ranking for information retrieval tasks. Our proposed method, 'DeepReRank', leverages deep neural networks to learn contextualized representations of documents and queries. By adaptively re-weighting the relevance scores based on the semantic similarity between the query and document, DeepReRank achieves significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that DeepReRank outperforms state-of-the-art models, while reducing the computational overhead by up to 30%.
