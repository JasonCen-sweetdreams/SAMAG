Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems to improve search accuracy. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and suffer from limited expressive power. This paper introduces a novel approach, GraphQE, which leverages deep graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn rich query representations from graph-structured data. We propose a query-graph attention mechanism to selectively incorporate relevant context and a graph-based semantic similarity measure to identify informative expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
