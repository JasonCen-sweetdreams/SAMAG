Distributed information retrieval systems face the challenge of efficiently processing complex queries across large-scale document collections. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical indexing approach, dubbed 'HierIndex', which leverages a combination of term frequency and document frequency to prune the search space. Our technique partitions the index into multiple layers, each optimized for a specific query type, enabling more efficient query routing and reducing the number of network hops. Experimental results on a large-scale web dataset demonstrate that HierIndex achieves a significant reduction in query latency and improves overall system throughput compared to traditional indexing methods.
