Real-time anomaly detection in time series data streams is crucial for various applications, including IoT, finance, and healthcare. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'TS-ADNet', which leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to detect anomalies in real-time data streams. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant features and time scales, enabling effective anomaly detection in high-dimensional and noisy data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that TS-ADNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
