Main-memory column-store databases have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics due to their exceptional performance and low latency. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'RT(Column)', which leverages advanced statistical models and machine learning techniques to predict query execution times and optimize query plans. We also introduce a novel cost model that takes into account the unique characteristics of main-memory column-store databases. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RT(Column) outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
