As the global population ages, designing accessible interfaces for older adults becomes increasingly important. This paper investigates the impact of speech recognition technology on cognitive load in voice-based interfaces for older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65-85, comparing three interface designs: manual text input, speech-to-text with error correction, and speech-to-text without error correction. Our results show that speech recognition technology can significantly reduce cognitive load, but error correction mechanisms can introduce additional cognitive demands. We propose design guidelines for voice-based interfaces that balance speech recognition accuracy with cognitive load reduction.
