Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but users with motor impairments often face significant barriers to accessing VR experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces that accommodate users with motor impairments. We propose a set of guidelines and heuristics for designing intuitive and adaptive interfaces that can be controlled using alternative input methods, such as eye-tracking and voice commands. Our user study with 20 participants with motor impairments demonstrates that our approach can significantly improve the usability and accessibility of VR systems for this population.
