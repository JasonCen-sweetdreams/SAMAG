Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly prevalent, but the effects of display type on user experience are not well understood. This study investigates how different display types (OLED, LCD, and MicroLED) influence gestural interaction in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, analyzing their performance and subjective feedback on a series of gestural tasks. Our results show that OLED displays lead to faster and more accurate gestural interactions, while MicroLED displays result in reduced fatigue and eye strain. We discuss the implications of our findings for VR system design and provide recommendations for optimizing gestural interaction across different display types.
