This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for distributed resource allocation in smart grids. We consider a scenario where multiple autonomous agents, each representing a microgrid, must negotiate and allocate resources to optimize energy efficiency and reduce peak demand. Our approach leverages deep Q-networks to learn cooperative policies that adapt to changing environmental conditions and agent interactions. We evaluate our method using a realistic simulation platform and demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization and system stability compared to traditional centralized approaches.
