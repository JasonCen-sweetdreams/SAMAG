Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, aiming to reformulate user queries to better capture their intent. We propose a novel QE approach, NeuroQE, which leverages neural semantic embeddings to model the relationships between query terms and their expansions. By incorporating a graph-based attention mechanism, NeuroQE can effectively capture the context and semantic nuances of the query, leading to improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE techniques, achieving significant gains in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
