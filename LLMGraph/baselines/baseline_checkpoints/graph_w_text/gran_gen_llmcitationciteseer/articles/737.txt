Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems to improve the retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep reinforcement learning, which learns to select the most informative terms to add to the original query. Our approach, called DRL-QE, uses a deep Q-network to learn the policy of selecting expansion terms based on their expected reward, which is defined as the relevance of the expanded query to the user's information need. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DRL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, including those based on pseudo-relevance feedback and word embeddings.
