Query optimization is a crucial component of relational databases, as it significantly impacts query performance. With the increasing adoption of distributed databases, traditional query optimization techniques are no longer effective. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query plans in distributed relational databases. Our approach, called 'DistOpt', uses a graph neural network to model the query optimization problem and a reinforcement learning framework to learn an optimal query plan. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DistOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
