The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential increase in network traffic, making anomaly detection a critical task. Existing approaches suffer from scalability issues, particularly when dealing with massive IoT networks. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages graph attention mechanisms to identify anomalies in IoT networks. HGAT hierarchically represents IoT devices as nodes in a graph, enabling efficient processing of large-scale networks. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
