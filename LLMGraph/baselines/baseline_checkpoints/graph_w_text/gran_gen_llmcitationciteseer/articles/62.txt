Short-text retrieval is a challenging task due to the limited context and ambiguity of user queries. This paper explores the application of neural language models to query expansion for improving retrieval effectiveness. We propose a novel approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages the semantic capabilities of BERT to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our method adaptively selects relevant terms based on their contextual relevance and semantic similarity to the original query. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall.
