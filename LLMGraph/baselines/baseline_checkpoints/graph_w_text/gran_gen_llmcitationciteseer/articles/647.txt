Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in many households, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the requirements of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with 20 older adults to identify their needs, preferences, and challenges when interacting with voice assistants. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise voice output, visual feedback, and customizable command structures. We developed a prototype incorporating these design principles and evaluated it with 15 older adults, resulting in significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates.
