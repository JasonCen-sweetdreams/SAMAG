Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face scalability challenges due to the high volume of query traffic. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize query processing in DIR systems using hierarchical Bloom filters (HBFs). Our method leverages the hierarchical structure of the filter to reduce the number of nodes involved in query processing, resulting in significant improvements in query response time and throughput. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale DIR system and demonstrate a 30% reduction in query latency and a 25% increase in system throughput compared to existing methods.
