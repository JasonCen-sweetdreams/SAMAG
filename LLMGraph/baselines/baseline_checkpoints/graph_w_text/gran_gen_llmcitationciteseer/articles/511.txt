Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data. However, query optimization remains a major bottleneck in DDS, as it involves complex joins and subqueries across multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel graph-based decomposition approach, called 'GraphOpt', which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to optimize query execution. GraphOpt first decomposes the query graph into smaller subgraphs, and then applies a dynamic programming-based approach to identify the optimal execution plan. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that GraphOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
