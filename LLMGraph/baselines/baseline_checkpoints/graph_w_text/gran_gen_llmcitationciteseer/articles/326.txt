Effective disaster response relies on the coordination of multiple autonomous agents, such as drones and robots, to perform complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel framework for coordinating agents through hierarchical task networks (HTNs), which enable the decomposition of high-level goals into lower-level tasks. We introduce a task allocation algorithm that considers the capabilities and availability of agents, as well as the dynamic environment. Experimental results using a realistic disaster response scenario show that our approach achieves significant improvements in task completion time and resource efficiency compared to existing methods.
