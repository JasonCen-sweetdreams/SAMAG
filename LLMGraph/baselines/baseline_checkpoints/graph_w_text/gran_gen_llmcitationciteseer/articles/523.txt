Multi-tenant database systems are increasingly popular in cloud-based data management. However, optimizing queries for diverse workloads and tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages learned indexes to improve query performance in multi-tenant environments. We propose a hierarchical indexing framework, 'MT-LIX', which combines traditional B+-tree indexing with machine learning-based index selection. Our approach adapts to changing workload patterns and tenant characteristics, achieving up to 3x query speedup compared to traditional indexing methods. Experimental results on a real-world cloud database workload demonstrate the efficacy of MT-LIX in reducing query latency and improving system scalability.
