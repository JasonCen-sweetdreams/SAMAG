The proliferation of IoT devices has created a need for efficient task allocation mechanisms to optimize resource utilization and minimize latency. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to allocate tasks in IoT networks. Our approach, called 'MARL-TA', uses a decentralized, asynchronous learning strategy to train agent policies that adapt to dynamic network conditions. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that MARL-TA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and network resource utilization.
