Chatbots have become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including customer service, healthcare, and education. However, their ability to provide emotional support and empathy remains a significant concern. This study explores the role of emotional intelligence in chatbot design, examining how empathetic responses can improve user experience and trust. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants, analyzing their interactions with a chatbot designed to provide emotional support. Our results show that empathetic chatbots can significantly increase user satisfaction, reduce feelings of frustration, and enhance perceived emotional support. We provide design recommendations for creating inclusive chatbots that can effectively support users' emotional needs.
