In decentralized multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel context-aware task allocation framework that leverages agent capabilities, task requirements, and environmental factors to optimize task assignments. We introduce a probabilistic ontology-based model to represent agent knowledge and context, and a distributed constraint optimization algorithm to allocate tasks. Experimental results on a real-world disaster response scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system performance compared to existing approaches.
