Domain-specific search engines often struggle with ad-hoc queries that contain ambiguous or domain-specific terminology. This paper proposes a neural query expansion approach, 'NQE-DSS', which leverages a combination of word embeddings and domain knowledge graphs to generate more effective query representations. Our experiments on a large-scale dataset of biomedical queries show that NQE-DSS significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, resulting in a 23% increase in mean average precision and a 17% increase in mean reciprocal rank.
