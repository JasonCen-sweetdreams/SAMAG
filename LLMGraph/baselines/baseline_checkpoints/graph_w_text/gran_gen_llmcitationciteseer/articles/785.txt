Traditional keyword extraction methods for document retrieval often rely on shallow term frequency analysis, leading to suboptimal query representations. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach, 'GraphKE', which leverages document- keyword co-occurrence networks to extract relevant keywords and expand user queries. We propose a scalable algorithm for graph-based keyword ranking and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving retrieval performance on several benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that GraphKE outperforms state-of-the-art keyword extraction methods, achieving a 12% increase in mean average precision.
