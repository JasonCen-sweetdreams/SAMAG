In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous task allocation using graph-based reinforcement learning. We model the agent-task assignment as a graph, where agents and tasks are nodes, and edges represent compatibility and resource constraints. Our proposed algorithm, GraphAgent, leverages the graph structure to learn a policy that maximizes task completion while minimizing resource utilization. Experimental results on a set of simulated scenarios demonstrate that GraphAgent outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate and resource efficiency.
