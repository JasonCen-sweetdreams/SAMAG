Smart home systems have become increasingly popular, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a gamification framework, 'SmartPlay', that leverages persuasive design principles to encourage users to adopt energy-efficient behaviors. We conducted a 6-week user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that SmartPlay increases user interaction by 35% and energy savings by 22% compared to traditional interfaces. Our results also show that personalized feedback and social norms-based incentives are key factors in promoting sustained user engagement.
