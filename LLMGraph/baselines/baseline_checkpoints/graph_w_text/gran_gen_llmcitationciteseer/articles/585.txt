Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck in these systems. This paper presents a novel adaptive indexing approach that dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that our approach achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional indexing techniques, while reducing storage overhead by 25%. We also present a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between query performance, storage efficiency, and indexing overhead.
