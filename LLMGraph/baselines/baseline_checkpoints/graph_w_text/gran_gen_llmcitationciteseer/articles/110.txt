This paper presents a novel approach to scalable multi-agent task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'MAgent', which enables agents to learn efficient task allocation strategies through self-play. Our method leverages a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn optimal task assignment policies. Experimental results on a large-scale logistics scenario demonstrate that MAgent achieves significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization-based methods.
