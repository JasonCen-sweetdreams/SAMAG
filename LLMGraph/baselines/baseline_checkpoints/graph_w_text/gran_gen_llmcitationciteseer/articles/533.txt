Semantic search has become a crucial component in various information retrieval systems, but its computational complexity hinders its widespread adoption. This paper proposes a novel approach to semantic search by exploiting the hierarchical structure of query graphs. We introduce a graph-based indexing technique that leverages the hierarchical relationships between entities to prune the search space, thereby reducing the number of candidate entities to be ranked. Our experiments on a large-scale knowledge graph demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements in query response time while maintaining the accuracy of the search results.
