Accurate query intent detection is crucial for effective information retrieval. This paper presents a novel unsupervised approach, Hierarchical Graph Query Intent Detector (HGQID), which leverages graph neural networks to capture complex relationships between query tokens and their intent. Our method first constructs a hierarchical graph representation of the query, and then applies a graph attention mechanism to identify key intent-related tokens. Experimental results on a large-scale query log dataset demonstrate that HGQID outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by 12.5% in terms of intent detection accuracy, while also providing interpretable results.
