As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to ensure that older adults with cognitive impairments can fully participate in and benefit from these experiences. This paper presents a co-design approach that involves older adults with cognitive impairments as active participants in the design process. We explore the use of participatory design methods, including contextual inquiry, co-creation workshops, and usability testing, to inform the development of accessible VR experiences. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, familiarity, and user control in designing VR interfaces that are intuitive and enjoyable for this population. We also discuss the implications of our research for the development of inclusive VR experiences that can promote social engagement, cognitive stimulation, and overall well-being for older adults.
