Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) systems face significant scalability challenges when processing complex queries. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that reduces the dimensionality of query vectors while preserving semantic meaning. Our HQE method leverages a multi-layered neural network to learn hierarchical representations of query terms, enabling efficient document retrieval in large-scale DIR systems. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms existing query expansion techniques in terms of precision, recall, and query processing time.
