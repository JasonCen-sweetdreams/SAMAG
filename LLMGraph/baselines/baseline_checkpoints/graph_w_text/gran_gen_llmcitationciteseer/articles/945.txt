This paper introduces a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems by leveraging hierarchical graph attention networks (HGATs). Our proposed framework, 'CoorHGAT', enables agents to learn complex coordination strategies by aggregating information from neighboring agents and higher-level graph structures. We demonstrate the efficacy of CoorHGAT in a series of experiments involving decentralized traffic control and resource allocation problems, showcasing improved performance and scalability compared to existing methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies provide insights into the benefits of hierarchical graph attention in multi-agent coordination.
