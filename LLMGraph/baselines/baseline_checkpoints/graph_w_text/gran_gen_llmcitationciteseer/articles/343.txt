Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to enrich the original query to better capture the user's information need. While traditional QE methods rely on term co-occurrence analysis, we propose a novel approach that leverages semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between terms. Our method, 'SemQE', represents queries and documents as dense vectors and incorporates a novel attention mechanism to selectively weigh term importance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate that SemQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
