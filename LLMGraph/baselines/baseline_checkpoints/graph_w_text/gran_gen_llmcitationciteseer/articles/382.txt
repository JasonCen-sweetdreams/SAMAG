Query expansion is a crucial component in modern information retrieval systems, aiming to bridge the gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural relevance feedback framework, 'DeepRF', to enhance query expansion by incorporating user feedback and document semantics. Our model leverages a multi-task learning approach, jointly optimizing query expansion and relevance prediction tasks. Experimental results on the TREC datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
