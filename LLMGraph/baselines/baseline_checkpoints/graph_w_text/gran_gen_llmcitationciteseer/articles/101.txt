Hierarchical sentiment analysis is a complex task that involves identifying sentiment at multiple levels of granularity, from individual aspects to overall entities. This paper proposes a multi-task learning framework that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model the hierarchical relationships between aspects and entities. Our approach jointly learns sentiment analysis and aspect extraction tasks, leveraging the shared knowledge to improve performance on both tasks. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both aspect-level and entity-level sentiment analysis tasks.
