Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are increasingly used to index and query large-scale document collections. However, query performance remains a major bottleneck due to the high latency and bandwidth requirements of traditional indexing methods. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HierIndex', which leverages a multi-level tree structure to efficiently prune the search space and reduce query latency. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale text corpus demonstrates that HierIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 30% in terms of query throughput and 25% in terms of average query latency.
