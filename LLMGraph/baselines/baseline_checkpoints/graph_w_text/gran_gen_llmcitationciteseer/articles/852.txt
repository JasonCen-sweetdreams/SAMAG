Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in node classification tasks, but often struggle to capture complex relationships between nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based GNN architecture, 'HAGNN', which leverages attention mechanisms at multiple scales to selectively focus on relevant node neighbors. We evaluate HAGNN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in node classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art GNN models. Further analysis reveals that HAGNN is particularly effective in handling graphs with heterogeneous node degrees and community structures.
