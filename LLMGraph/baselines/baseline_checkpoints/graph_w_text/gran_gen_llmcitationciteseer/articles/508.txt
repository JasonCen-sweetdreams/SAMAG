Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the semantic gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepQL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query expansion. We formulate query expansion as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to select expansion terms that maximize the expected retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
