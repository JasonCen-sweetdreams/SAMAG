Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing framework, 'AIx', that dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query workloads and data distributions. We introduce a novel cost-based optimization algorithm that incorporates statistical models of query patterns and data correlations, enabling AIx to outperform existing indexing techniques by up to 30% in query response time. Experimental evaluations on a real-world DDS deployment demonstrate the effectiveness of AIx in improving query performance and reducing resource utilization.
