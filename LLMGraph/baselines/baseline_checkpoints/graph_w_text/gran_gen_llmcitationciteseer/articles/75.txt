Virtual meetings have become an essential tool for remote collaboration, but often suffer from poor camera angles and limited user engagement. This paper presents EyeGazeDirector, a novel gaze-based interface for autonomous camera control in virtual meetings. Our system uses machine learning-based gaze estimation to infer user attention and control camera movements, creating a more immersive and engaging experience. We evaluate EyeGazeDirector in a user study, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction and engagement compared to traditional manual camera control.
