With the increasing adoption of distributed databases, optimizing query processing for complex event processing (CEP) has become a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization framework, 'DistributedCEP', which leverages graph-based query decomposition and parallel processing to minimize latency and improve throughput. Our approach utilizes a cost-based optimizer that considers both data locality and communication costs to generate efficient query plans. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that DistributedCEP outperforms existing CEP systems by up to 3x in terms of query response time and scales to handle high-volume event streams.
