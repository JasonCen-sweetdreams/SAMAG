The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of time series data, posing significant challenges for query optimization in distributed database systems. This paper presents a novel approach, 'TSQR', which leverages a combination of indexing, caching, and parallel processing to accelerate query execution. TSQR employs a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify correlated time series segments and reorders query execution to minimize disk I/O and network communication. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrates that TSQR outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time and 2x in terms of system throughput.
