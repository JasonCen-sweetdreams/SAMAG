Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 50 participants, using a custom-built VR platform that incorporates real-time facial expression tracking and personalized avatar rendering. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, measured through self-reported satisfaction and objective metrics such as session duration and interaction frequency. We also identify key factors influencing user preference for personalized avatars, including facial similarity and customization options.
