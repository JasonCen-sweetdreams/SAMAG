Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely on query expansion techniques to improve retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'EmbExpan', which leverages word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. We introduce a new embedding-based similarity metric that incorporates both local and global context information. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval benchmark show that EmbExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
