The proliferation of online information has made it increasingly challenging for search engines to provide diverse and relevant search results. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, which incorporates user search history and preferences to generate expanded queries that capture the nuances of the original query intent. Our approach leverages a graph-based representation of the query context and employs a reinforcement learning-based ranking model to optimize the diversity of search results. Experimental results on a large-scale search engine dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search result diversity and user satisfaction.
