Explainable AI (XAI) has become a crucial aspect of modern recommendation systems, as users increasingly demand transparency into the decision-making process. This paper introduces a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) framework, 'ExplainRec', which integrates node-level explanations into the recommendation workflow. By modeling complex item relationships and user behaviors as a heterogeneous graph, ExplainRec leverages graph attention and hierarchical reasoning to generate personalized recommendations with accompanying explanations. Our experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate improved recommendation accuracy and enhanced user trust through explainable AI.
