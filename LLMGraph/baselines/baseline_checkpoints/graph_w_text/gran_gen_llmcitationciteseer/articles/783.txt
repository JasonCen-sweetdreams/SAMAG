Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using machine learning techniques. We develop a query optimizer that leverages a graph neural network to model the database schema and predict the optimal execution plan for a given query. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
