E-commerce platforms face the challenge of efficiently searching and ranking short-text product descriptions to provide users with relevant results. This paper proposes a novel hybrid retrieval model, 'HybridRank', which combines the strengths of term-based and semantic-based retrieval approaches. HybridRank incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and product descriptions, while leveraging sparse term-frequency representations to reduce computational overhead. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HybridRank achieves a 25% increase in recall and a 30% reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art retrieval models.
