In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We formulate the task allocation problem as a DCOP and propose a novel algorithm that leverages asynchronous communication and iterative constraint propagation to find near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on a synthetic benchmark dataset show that our approach outperforms existing decentralized methods in terms of solution quality and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale multi-agent systems.
