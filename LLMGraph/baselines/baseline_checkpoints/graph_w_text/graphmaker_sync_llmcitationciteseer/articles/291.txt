Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize the way we learn and interact with spatial information. However, the cognitive processes underlying spatial awareness in VR remain poorly understood. This paper presents an embodied cognition framework for enhancing spatial awareness in VR. We designed a VR environment that leverages gesture-based interactions and haptic feedback to facilitate spatial understanding. Our user study with 30 participants shows that our approach improves spatial accuracy and reduces cognitive load compared to traditional mouse-based interfaces. The results have implications for the design of VR-based training systems and spatial cognition research.
