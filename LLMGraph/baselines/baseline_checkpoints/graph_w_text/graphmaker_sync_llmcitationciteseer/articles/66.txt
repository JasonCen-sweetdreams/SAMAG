Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize experiences for people with visual impairments, but existing VR interfaces are often inaccessible. This paper presents an inclusive VR design framework that incorporates haptic feedback, audio cues, and voice commands to enable visually impaired users to navigate and interact with virtual environments. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, which revealed significant improvements in usability and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our framework provides a foundation for developing more accessible VR experiences, promoting equal access to immersive technologies for people with visual impairments.
