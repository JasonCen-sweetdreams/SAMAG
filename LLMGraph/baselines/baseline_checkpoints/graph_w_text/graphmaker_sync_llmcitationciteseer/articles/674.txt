Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but existing methods often suffer from scalability issues or poor performance on large graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages a hierarchical graph representation to reduce computational complexity. HGAT adaptively selects relevant neighbors at each layer, enabling efficient feature propagation and improved node classification accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT, achieving state-of-the-art performance on large-scale graphs while reducing inference time by up to 70%
