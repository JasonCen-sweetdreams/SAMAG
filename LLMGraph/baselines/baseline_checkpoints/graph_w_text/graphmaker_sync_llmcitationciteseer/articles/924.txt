Deep retrieval models have improved ad-hoc search performance, but often struggle to capture the nuanced semantics of complex queries. This paper introduces Hierarchical Query Embeddings (HQE), a novel approach that represents queries as hierarchical graphs of word and phrase embeddings. We show that incorporating HQE into a state-of-the-art deep retrieval model significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, particularly for challenging queries with multiple entities and relationships. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of HQE, outperforming existing query embedding methods in various evaluation settings.
