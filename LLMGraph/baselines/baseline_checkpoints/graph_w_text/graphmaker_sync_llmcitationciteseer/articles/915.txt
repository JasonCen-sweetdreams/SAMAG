Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive VR interfaces that cater to individuals with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with users with disabilities and developed a set of guidelines for accessible VR interaction. Our evaluation shows that the proposed interface significantly improves user experience and task performance for participants with disabilities, paving the way for more inclusive VR applications.
