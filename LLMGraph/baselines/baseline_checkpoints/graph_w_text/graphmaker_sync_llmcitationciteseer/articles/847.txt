Temporal graph databases have become increasingly popular for modeling complex relationships between entities over time. However, query optimization for such databases remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for temporal graph databases. Our method, called TemporalGraphRL, uses a graph neural network to learn a policy for selecting the most efficient query plan based on the graph structure, query patterns, and data distributions. Experimental results on real-world temporal graph datasets demonstrate that TemporalGraphRL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
