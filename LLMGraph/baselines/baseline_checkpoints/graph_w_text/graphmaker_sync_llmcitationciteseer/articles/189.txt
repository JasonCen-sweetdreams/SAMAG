Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in enhancing learning experiences, but user engagement remains a crucial factor in its adoption. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR-based learning environments. We designed an experiment where participants were randomly assigned to either a generic avatar or a personalized avatar that reflected their physical appearance and personality traits. Our results indicate that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, measured through self-reported surveys and behavioral metrics, compared to those with generic avatars. Furthermore, we found that the impact of personalized avatars varied across different learning tasks and user demographics.
