Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in modern information retrieval systems, as it enhances the retrieval performance by incorporating relevant terms into the original query. However, existing QE methods suffer from scalability issues, particularly when dealing with large datasets and complex queries. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Neural Network Embeddings (HNNE), which leverages the strengths of both neural networks and hierarchical clustering to generate effective query expansions. Our method models the semantic relationships between terms using a hierarchical neural network, allowing for efficient and effective query expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNNE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval performance and computational efficiency.
