Distributed database systems require efficient query optimization to minimize response times and resource utilization. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on rule-based approaches or statistical models, which may not capture complex relationships between query patterns and system dynamics. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn query execution plans. Our approach represents the database schema and query workload as a graph, which is fed into a GNN to predict optimal execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
