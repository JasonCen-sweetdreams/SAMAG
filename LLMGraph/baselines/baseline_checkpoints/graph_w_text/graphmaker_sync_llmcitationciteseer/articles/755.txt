In Internet of Things (IoT) networks, efficient task allocation is crucial for optimizing resource utilization and minimizing latency. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'DTRL', for distributed task allocation in IoT networks. DTRL employs a decentralized architecture, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on local observations and communicates with neighboring agents to achieve global optimality. We evaluate DTRL on a simulated IoT network and demonstrate significant improvements in task allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional centralized approaches.
