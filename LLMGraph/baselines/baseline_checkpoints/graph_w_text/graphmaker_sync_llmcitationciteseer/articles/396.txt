The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in smart grids necessitates the development of advanced control strategies. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for coordinating autonomous agents in smart grids. We design a two-level architecture, where a high-level agent learns to optimize the overall grid performance, while low-level agents focus on local voltage control. Our approach enables agents to adapt to dynamic grid conditions, reduce energy losses, and improve voltage stability. Simulation results on a realistic grid model demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing energy losses by up to 12% compared to traditional rule-based control methods.
