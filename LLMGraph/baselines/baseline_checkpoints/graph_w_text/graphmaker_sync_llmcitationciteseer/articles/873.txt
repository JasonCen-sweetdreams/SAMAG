Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but the impact of embodiment on social presence in VR remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining how different embodiment styles (e.g., full-body avatars, hand-tracking, or controller-based interactions) influence users' sense of social presence in VR. Our results show that full-body avatars significantly enhance social presence, while hand-tracking and controller-based interactions have a neutral effect. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR system design and future research on embodiment in HCI.
