Entity disambiguation in knowledge graphs (KGs) often relies on query expansion techniques to capture contextual information. However, existing methods suffer from high computational costs and limited semantic understanding. We propose a novel query expansion framework, 'KG-Expand', which leverages graph attention mechanisms and lexical semantic analysis to selectively incorporate relevant entities and relationships. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, such as YAGO and DBpedia, with significant reductions in computational time. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of KG-Expand in improving entity disambiguation accuracy for downstream applications, such as question answering and text classification.
