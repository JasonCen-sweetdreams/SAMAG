Multivariate time series forecasting is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and energy management. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity and poor scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical temporal convolutional network (HTCN) architecture that leverages both local and global temporal dependencies in multivariate time series data. Our approach reduces the computational cost by 30% compared to state-of-the-art methods while achieving competitive forecasting accuracy on several benchmark datasets.
