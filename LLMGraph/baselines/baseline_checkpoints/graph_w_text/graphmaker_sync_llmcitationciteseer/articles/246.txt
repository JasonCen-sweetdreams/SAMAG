As voice-based interfaces become increasingly prevalent, it is essential to ensure their accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice interface, 'EasyVocal', tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a series of participatory design workshops and usability studies to inform the design of EasyVocal, which incorporates features such as simplified language, visual feedback, and error forgiveness. Our evaluation results show that EasyVocal significantly improves the user experience and task completion rates for older adults with cognitive impairments, demonstrating the potential for voice interfaces to promote digital inclusion.
