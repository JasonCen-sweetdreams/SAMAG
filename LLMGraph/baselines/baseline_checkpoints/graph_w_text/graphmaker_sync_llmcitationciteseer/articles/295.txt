As Augmented Reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to develop strategies for managing cognitive load in AR-based systems. This paper presents an adaptive visualization framework, 'CogVis', which dynamically adjusts the complexity and content of AR visualizations based on real-time user feedback and cognitive load metrics. Our user study demonstrates that CogVis reduces cognitive load, improves task performance, and enhances user experience in AR-based learning and training applications. We also provide guidelines for incorporating cognitive load management into AR system design.
