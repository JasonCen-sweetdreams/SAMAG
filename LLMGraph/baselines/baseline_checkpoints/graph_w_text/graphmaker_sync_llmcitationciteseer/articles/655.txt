In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that involves assigning tasks to agents with varying capabilities. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'HeteroAssign', which leverages graph neural networks to model agent capabilities and task requirements. HeteroAssign uses a consensus-based optimization approach to allocate tasks in a decentralized manner, ensuring that agents with suitable capabilities are assigned tasks that maximize system efficiency. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that HeteroAssign outperforms existing centralized and decentralized methods in terms of task completion rate and system adaptability.
