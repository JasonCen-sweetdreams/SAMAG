Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and high traffic. However, optimizing query execution in DDS remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph-based reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in DDS. Our approach models the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to navigate the search space of possible query plans to minimize execution time. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
