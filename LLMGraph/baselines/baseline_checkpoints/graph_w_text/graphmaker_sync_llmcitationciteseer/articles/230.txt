Traffic signal control is a complex problem that requires real-time decision-making to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. This paper proposes a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'HMA-RL', that coordinates traffic signals across a network of intersections. HMA-RL consists of a top-level controller that learns to allocate green light times to different intersections and a set of low-level agents that adjust their signal phases based on local traffic conditions. We evaluate HMA-RL on a real-world traffic dataset and show that it outperforms traditional fixed-time and actuated signal control methods in terms of average travel time and queue length.
