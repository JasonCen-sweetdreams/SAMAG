Distributed dataspaces have emerged as a promising architecture for integrating heterogeneous data sources. However, optimizing queries in such environments remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and varying source capabilities. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'DQM', which leverages a combination of statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to efficiently identify optimal query plans. We demonstrate the efficacy of DQM through extensive experiments on a real-world distributed dataspace, showcasing significant performance improvements over existing optimization methods.
