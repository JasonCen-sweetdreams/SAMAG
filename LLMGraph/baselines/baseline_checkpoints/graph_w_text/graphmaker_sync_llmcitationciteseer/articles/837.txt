Virtual assistants (VAs) have become ubiquitous in modern life, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the application of gamification techniques to improve user interaction with VAs. We designed and developed a gamified VA prototype, incorporating features such as point systems, leaderboards, and personalized challenges. A user study with 120 participants demonstrated a significant increase in user engagement, with participants exhibiting higher motivation and enjoyment when interacting with the gamified VA compared to a standard VA. Our findings provide insights into the potential of gamification to enhance the user experience with VAs.
