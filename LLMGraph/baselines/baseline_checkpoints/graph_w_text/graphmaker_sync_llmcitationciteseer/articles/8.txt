Distributed search engines are crucial for efficient information retrieval in large-scale document collections. However, query rewriting remains a bottleneck due to the overhead of re-indexing and re-ranking. This paper proposes an incremental query rewriting approach, 'IQREW', which leverages query logs and document similarity to rewrite queries in real-time. IQREW reduces the number of re-indexed documents by 30% and improves retrieval efficiency by 25% compared to state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate IQREW on the TREC-8 dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing query latency while maintaining retrieval accuracy.
