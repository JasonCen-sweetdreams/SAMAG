Real-time data warehousing requires optimizing complex queries to minimize latency and ensure freshness of data. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQOpt', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn optimal query plans from historical query logs and system metadata. We design a hierarchical DQN architecture that incorporates domain knowledge from database optimization and explores the vast space of possible query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DeepQOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time and 2x in terms of system resource utilization.
