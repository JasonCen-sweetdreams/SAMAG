This paper proposes a novel framework for coordinating multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning with graph attention. We introduce a new architecture that incorporates graph attention mechanisms to learn agent relationships and coordination strategies. Our approach is evaluated on a series of benchmarks, including traffic control and robotic swarm coordination tasks. The results show significant improvements in coordination efficiency and task completion rates compared to existing methods. We also provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of our algorithm in decentralized settings.
