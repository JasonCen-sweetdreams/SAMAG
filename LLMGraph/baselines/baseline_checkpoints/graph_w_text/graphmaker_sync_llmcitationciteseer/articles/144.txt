This paper addresses the task allocation problem in cooperative multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and resource constraints need to collectively accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel auction-based framework, 'CoopAuction', which enables agents to bid for tasks based on their expected utilities. Our approach incorporates a probabilistic task model, allowing agents to reason about uncertainty and risk in task execution. Experimental results on a realistic autonomous vehicle scenario demonstrate that CoopAuction outperforms existing allocation methods in terms of system-wide efficiency, fairness, and adaptability to changing environments.
