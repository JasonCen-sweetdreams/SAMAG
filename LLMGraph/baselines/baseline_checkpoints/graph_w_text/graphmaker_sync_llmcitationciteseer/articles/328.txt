Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but existing avatar designs often neglect the emotional and social needs of users. This paper presents 'Empatho', a novel framework for creating emotive avatars that facilitate empathetic connections in VR. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants, which revealed that our avatars' emotional expressions and gestures significantly improved user engagement and social presence. We also developed a set of guidelines for inclusive avatar design, emphasizing the importance of cultural sensitivity and diversity representation.
