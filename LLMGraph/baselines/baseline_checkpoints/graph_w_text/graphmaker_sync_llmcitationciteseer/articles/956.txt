In real-world multi-agent systems, agents often have incomplete information about their environment and other agents' intentions. This paper proposes a novel approach to coordinated multi-agent planning that leverages graph attention networks to model agent relationships and infer missing information. Our method, called GAPLan, integrates a graph neural network with a planning framework to generate high-quality plans that account for uncertainty. We evaluate GAPLan in a complex rescue scenario and demonstrate improved planning performance compared to existing methods that rely on complete information.
