Voice assistants have the potential to improve the lives of older adults, but existing systems often neglect their unique needs and abilities. This paper presents a participatory design study that involved 20 older adults in the co-design of an inclusive voice assistant. We identified four key themes: simplicity, flexibility, trust, and social connection. Our findings inform the development of a prototype that incorporates these themes, including a simplified interface, flexible input methods, and trust-building features. Our study demonstrates the importance of involving older adults in the design process to create voice assistants that are accessible and usable for this growing population.
