Distributed database systems require efficient query optimization to ensure scalability and responsiveness. This paper presents a novel approach, Adaptive Indexing (AIx), which dynamically adjusts index structures based on query workload and data distribution. AIx leverages online learning to predict query patterns and adaptively creates or drops indexes to minimize query latency. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that AIx outperforms traditional indexing techniques by up to 30% in query response time, while reducing storage overhead by 25%. We also explore the trade-offs between query performance and indexing overhead in distributed database systems.
