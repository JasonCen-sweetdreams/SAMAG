Explainable AI (XAI) is crucial in recommender systems to build trust with users. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT) for XAI-powered recommenders. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to learn item relationships and hierarchically aggregates features to provide personalized explanations. We propose a novel attention-based explanation method to highlight influential items and attributes contributing to the recommendation. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate HGAT's superior recommendation performance and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
