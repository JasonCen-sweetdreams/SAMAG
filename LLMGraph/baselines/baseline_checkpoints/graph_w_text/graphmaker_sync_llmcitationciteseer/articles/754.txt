Neural search engines have shown promise in capturing semantic relationships between queries and documents. However, they often struggle with ambiguous or underspecified queries. This paper presents a context-aware query expansion framework that leverages both local and global contextual cues to disambiguate user queries. Our approach combines a graph-based query representation with a neural ranking model, allowing it to adapt to diverse search scenarios. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, especially for complex, open-domain queries.
