Deep neural networks are prone to overfitting when trained on noisy or mislabeled datasets. This paper presents a novel ensemble learning framework, 'AdaNoisy', which adaptively combines the predictions of multiple base models to improve robustness against noisy labels. Our approach utilizes a confidence-based weighting scheme, where the weights are learned dynamically during training. We also introduce a noisy label detection module that identifies and corrects mislabeled instances. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaNoisy achieves state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks, even in the presence of high label noise ratios.
