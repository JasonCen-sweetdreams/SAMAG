In this paper, we propose a novel approach to distributed task allocation for autonomous agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our method, called 'META', enables agents to learn decentralized policies that optimize task assignment in dynamic environments. We formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and employ a variant of deep Q-networks to learn effective allocation strategies. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that META outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
