This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the role of gesture-based interaction in shaping user experience. We designed a VR system that utilizes hand-tracking technology to enable users to manipulate virtual objects using natural hand gestures. Our study reveals that users who employed gestures to interact with virtual objects exhibited improved cognitive performance and enhanced sense of presence compared to those using traditional controllers. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of more intuitive and immersive VR interfaces.
