Sparse vector retrieval is a fundamental problem in information retrieval, where the goal is to efficiently search for similar sparse vectors in high-dimensional spaces. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing technique, 'SparseAdapt', which dynamically adjusts the indexing structure based on query patterns and data distribution. By exploiting the sparsity of the vectors, SparseAdapt achieves significant improvements in query performance, reducing the average response time by up to 40% compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate SparseAdapt on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in various retrieval scenarios.
