Autonomous vehicles rely on complex decision-making algorithms, but their lack of transparency hinders trust and accountability. This paper proposes a novel explainable reinforcement learning (ERL) framework for autonomous vehicle decision-making. Our approach integrates graph attention mechanisms to highlight critical road entities influencing the agent's policy. We introduce a novel attention-based explanation method, 'GraphExplain', which provides visual and quantitative insights into the decision-making process. Experimental results on a simulated driving environment demonstrate that our ERL framework achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods while providing meaningful explanations for the agent's actions.
