This study investigates the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to alleviate cognitive load in older adults when interacting with digital systems. We designed an ECA-based interface for a medication reminder system and conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 older adults. Our results show that participants experienced significantly reduced cognitive load when interacting with the ECA-based interface compared to a traditional text-based interface. Furthermore, we observed improved task completion time and reduced errors. Our findings have implications for the design of accessible and inclusive digital systems for older adults, and highlight the potential of ECAs as a means to support healthy aging.
