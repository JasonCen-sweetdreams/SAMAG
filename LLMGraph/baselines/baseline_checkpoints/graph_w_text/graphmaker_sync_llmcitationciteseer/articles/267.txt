Node classification in graph-structured data is a fundamental task in many real-world applications. However, the scarcity of labeled data in many domains hinders the performance of traditional graph neural networks. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture, which leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and edges in the graph. We demonstrate that HGAT can effectively adapt to few-shot learning scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we provide theoretical insights into the expressive power of HGAT and its ability to generalize to unseen graph structures.
