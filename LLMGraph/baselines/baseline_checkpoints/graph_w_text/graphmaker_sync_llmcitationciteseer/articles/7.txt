High-dimensional data indexing is a crucial component in various applications, including similarity search and data mining. Existing indexing methods, such as ball trees and locality-sensitive hashing, suffer from scalability issues and high computational costs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical hashing approach, dubbed 'HashTree', which leverages a recursive partitioning strategy to efficiently index high-dimensional data. Our approach achieves a significant reduction in query time and memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, making it suitable for large-scale datasets. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HashTree in various applications, including nearest neighbor search and clustering.
