Distributed document retrieval systems face significant scalability challenges in indexing and querying large document collections. This paper presents a novel hierarchical semantic indexing approach, 'HSI-DR', which leverages semantic embeddings to organize documents into a hierarchical structure. HSI-DR reduces the indexing time by 30% and query latency by 25% compared to state-of-the-art distributed indexing methods, while maintaining retrieval accuracy. We evaluate HSI-DR on a real-world dataset of 100 million documents and demonstrate its effectiveness in supporting complex queries and faceted search.
