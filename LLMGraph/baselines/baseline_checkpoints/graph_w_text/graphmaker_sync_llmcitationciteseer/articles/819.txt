Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but accurate gesture recognition remains a challenge. This paper explores the concept of embodiment in VR and its impact on gesture recognition. We designed an experiment to investigate how users' sense of embodiment influences their gesture patterns and recognition accuracy. Our results show that users with a higher sense of embodiment exhibit more natural and consistent gestures, leading to improved recognition accuracy. We propose a novel embodiment-based gesture recognition framework that incorporates user embodiment metrics, achieving an average accuracy of 92.5% on a benchmark dataset.
