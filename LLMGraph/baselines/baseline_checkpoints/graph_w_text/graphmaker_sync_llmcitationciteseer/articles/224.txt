Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to improve the quality of search results by incorporating relevant terms. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'QNExpand', which leverages semantic relationships between query terms and candidate expansion terms. QNExpand utilizes a dual-encoder architecture, where the query and candidate terms are separately embedded, followed by a attention-based interaction mechanism to predict the relevance of expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that QNExpand outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, yielding significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
