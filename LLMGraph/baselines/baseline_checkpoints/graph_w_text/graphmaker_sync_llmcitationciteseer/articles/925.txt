In multi-agent systems, effective task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, the presence of untrusted or Byzantine agents can compromise system performance. This paper introduces a novel decentralized task allocation framework, 'ATA', which incorporates adaptive trust mechanisms to mitigate the impact of malicious agents. ATA uses a Bayesian approach to update trust values based on agent behavior, and employs a distributed auction protocol to allocate tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that ATA outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate and robustness to agent failures.
