Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to provide immersive experiences for users with motor impairments. However, current VR interfaces often rely on precise hand or finger movements, limiting accessibility for individuals with mobility impairments. This paper presents a novel VR interface design that utilizes alternative input modalities, including gaze-based and voice-controlled interactions. Our user study with 20 participants with motor impairments shows that our designed interface significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. We also provide a set of design guidelines for creating accessible VR experiences.
