Virtual reality (VR) systems often lack nuanced haptic feedback, reducing immersion and user satisfaction. We present 'HapAxis', a novel framework that adaptively generates haptic effects based on real-time user behavior, environment, and task requirements. Our approach combines machine learning-driven prediction models with psychophysical analysis to optimize haptic feedback for diverse VR applications. A user study demonstrates that HapAxis significantly improves user engagement, task performance, and overall VR experience quality.
