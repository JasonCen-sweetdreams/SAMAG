With the increasing demand for real-time business intelligence, traditional row-store databases struggle to provide efficient query performance in data warehousing applications. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework that leverages column-store indexes to accelerate query execution. Our approach exploits the sparse nature of column-store data to reduce storage costs and improve query performance. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves up to 5x query speedup compared to traditional row-store databases, making it suitable for real-time data warehousing applications.
