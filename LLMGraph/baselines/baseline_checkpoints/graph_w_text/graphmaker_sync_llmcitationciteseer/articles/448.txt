In IoT networks, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient assignment of tasks to agents with varying capabilities. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using multi-agent reinforcement learning, where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their local observations and rewards. We introduce a novel algorithm, 'Distributed Task Allocation with Reinforcement Learning' (DTARL), which leverages the concept of graph convolutional networks to model agent interactions and optimize task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that DTARL outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
