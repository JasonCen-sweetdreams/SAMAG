Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed database systems. Our approach, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the system's current state and workload. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and system throughput compared to traditional optimization techniques.
