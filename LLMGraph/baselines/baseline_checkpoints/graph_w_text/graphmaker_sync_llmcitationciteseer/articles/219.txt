Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments, but current VR interfaces often exclude this population due to accessibility barriers. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CARE-VR', a novel VR interface tailored to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a user-centered design process involving 20 participants with mild cognitive impairment, resulting in a set of design guidelines and recommendations for inclusive VR interaction. Our evaluation study shows that CARE-VR significantly improves user engagement, task performance, and user experience compared to standard VR interfaces.
