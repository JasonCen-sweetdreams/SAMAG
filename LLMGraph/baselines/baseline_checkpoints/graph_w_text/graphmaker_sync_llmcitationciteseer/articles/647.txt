Multi-agent systems often face the challenge of task allocation, where agents must decide which tasks to execute in a distributed manner. This problem becomes even more complex when agents have incomplete information about the environment and other agents' capabilities. We propose a novel decentralized task allocation algorithm, called 'ITA', which utilizes a combination of local observation and communication to achieve near-optimal task assignments. ITA is based on a probabilistic graphical model that captures the uncertainty in agent capabilities and task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of ITA in achieving high task completion rates and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
