Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on simplistic term-weighting schemes. This paper proposes a novel QE approach that leverages deep learning-based contextualized embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and document content. Our model, 'EmbEx', incorporates a transformer-based architecture to generate dense, contextualized representations of query terms, which are then used to expand the query through a novel attention mechanism. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmbEx significantly outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving improved retrieval effectiveness and robustness to query ambiguity.
