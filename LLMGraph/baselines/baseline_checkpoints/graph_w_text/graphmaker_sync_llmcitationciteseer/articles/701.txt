Traditional ranking models in information retrieval often suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their applicability to large-scale document collections. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HierRank', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant document segments. By exploiting the document structure, HierRank reduces the computational overhead while maintaining state-of-the-art retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources.
