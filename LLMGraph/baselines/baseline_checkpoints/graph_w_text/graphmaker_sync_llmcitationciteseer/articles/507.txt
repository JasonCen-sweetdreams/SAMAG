Neural retrieval models have shown significant promise in information retrieval tasks, but they often struggle with limited training data and vocabulary mismatch. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to improve the performance of neural retrieval models. Our method, called 'NeuroXPand', uses a neural network to generate expansion terms from a set of pseudo-relevant documents, which are then incorporated into the original query. We evaluate NeuroXPand on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for rare and out-of-vocabulary terms.
