With the increasing scale of modern database systems, query optimization has become a critical component for achieving efficient data retrieval. This paper focuses on optimizing query performance in distributed database systems that employ multi-dimensional indexing. We propose a novel approach, 'DMIndex', which leverages a combination of clustering and caching techniques to reduce the number of disk I/O operations and minimize query latency. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database demonstrate that DMIndex outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
