Semantic search has become increasingly important in modern information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between entities. Our approach, called KGQE, uses a graph attention mechanism to select the most relevant entities and expand the query with contextual keywords. We evaluate KGQE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion methods. Furthermore, we show that KGQE can be efficiently integrated into existing search systems without requiring significant computational overhead.
