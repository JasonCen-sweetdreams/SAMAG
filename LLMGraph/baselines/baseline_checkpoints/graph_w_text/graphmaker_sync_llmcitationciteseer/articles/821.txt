Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants, have become ubiquitous in modern life. However, older adults often face difficulties using these systems, citing issues with understanding, trust, and usability. This paper presents a participatory design study with 20 older adults, co-designing and evaluating a conversational interface tailored to their needs. Our findings highlight the importance of speech recognition accuracy, clear and concise language, and personalized feedback. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating inclusive conversational interfaces that support older adults' autonomy and digital literacy. Our study contributes to the development of more accessible and user-centered conversational systems.
