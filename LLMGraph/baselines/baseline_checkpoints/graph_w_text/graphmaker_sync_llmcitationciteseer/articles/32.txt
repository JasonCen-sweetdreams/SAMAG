Skeleton-based action recognition has gained popularity in recent years, leveraging advances in computer vision and machine learning. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture, which models human skeletons as hierarchical graphs and incorporates attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant joints and sub-graphs. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmarks, including NTU-RGB+D and Kinectics, and demonstrates improved robustness to noise and occlusion. We also provide an ablation study to quantify the contributions of each component to the overall performance.
