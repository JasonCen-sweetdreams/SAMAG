Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering or expensive annotation processes. This paper proposes a neural semantic embedding-based approach, 'NeuroExpand', which learns to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and documents. Our method leverages a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query expansion and retrieval performance. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExpand outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving significant improvements in recall and precision while reducing the need for manual tuning.
