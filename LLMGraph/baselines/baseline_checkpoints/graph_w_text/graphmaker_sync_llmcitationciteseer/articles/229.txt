As main-memory databases become increasingly prevalent, query processing efficiency remains a major bottleneck. This paper explores the application of learned index structures to accelerate query execution in main-memory databases. We propose a novel neural network-based indexing approach, 'NeuroIX', which learns to predict the optimal query plan based on workload patterns and data distributions. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that NeuroIX achieves significant speedups over traditional indexing techniques, reducing query latency by up to 3.5x while maintaining comparable accuracy.
