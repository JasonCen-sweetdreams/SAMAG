In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a hierarchical task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments among agents. Our approach, called HTRL, learns to allocate tasks based on agent capabilities, task dependencies, and environmental constraints. We evaluate HTRL in a simulated warehouse management scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional decentralized methods. The proposed framework can be applied to various real-world domains, such as search and rescue, disaster response, and autonomous transportation systems.
