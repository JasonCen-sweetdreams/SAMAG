Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complex and technical nature of patent documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep semantic hashing (DSH) to improve the retrieval performance. Our method embeds patent queries and documents into a compact binary space, enabling efficient similarity search and query expansion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale patent dataset, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
