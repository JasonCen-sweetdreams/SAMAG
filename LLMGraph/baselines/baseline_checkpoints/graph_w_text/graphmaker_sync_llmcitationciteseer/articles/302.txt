Main-memory database systems (MMDBs) offer high performance, but indexing strategies remain crucial for query optimization. We propose an adaptive indexing approach, ADI, which dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distribution. ADI leverages a novel cost model that considers both query frequency and index maintenance overhead. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world MMDB system demonstrates that ADI achieves significant query performance improvements, up to 3.2x, compared to traditional static indexing techniques, while minimizing index maintenance costs.
