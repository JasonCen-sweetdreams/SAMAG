Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where multiple agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'CATAR', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task allocation in cooperative multi-agent systems. CATAR learns a decentralized policy that considers both local and global rewards, enabling agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that CATAR outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time, resource utilization, and system scalability.
