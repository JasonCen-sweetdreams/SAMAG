Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it can significantly improve the retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforced neural ranking model, 'RNN-Ranker', which learns to expand queries by generating context-aware and semantically relevant keywords. Our approach leverages a deep reinforcement learning framework to optimize the ranking model, allowing it to adapt to the complex query-document relationships. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RNN-Ranker outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving substantial improvements in precision and recall.
