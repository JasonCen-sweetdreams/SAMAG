Search engines often struggle to provide diverse search results, leading to a lack of novelty and redundancy in the retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which incorporates user search history and preferences to improve search result diversity. CAQE employs a graph-based method to model the semantic relationships between query terms and expands the query using contextualized embeddings. Experimental results on a large-scale web search dataset show that CAQE significantly improves search result diversity and novelty, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
