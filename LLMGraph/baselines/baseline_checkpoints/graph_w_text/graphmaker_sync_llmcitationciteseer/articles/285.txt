This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT) for explainable multi-agent reinforcement learning. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex agent interactions and hierarchical relationships in multi-agent systems. We propose a novel attention-based credit assignment algorithm that enables agents to learn from each other's experiences and provide interpretable explanations for their decision-making processes. Experimental results on a range of multi-agent domains demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in improving collaboration and coordination among agents while providing transparent and actionable insights into their behavior.
