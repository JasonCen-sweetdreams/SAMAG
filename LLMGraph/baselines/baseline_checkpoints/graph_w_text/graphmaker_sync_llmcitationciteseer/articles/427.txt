As smart home technology becomes increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need for intuitive and efficient human-computer interaction methods. This paper presents a novel gesture recognition system that adapts to individual users' preferences and habits in real-time. Our approach combines machine learning-based gesture classification with user feedback and contextual information from smart home sensors. We evaluate our system through a user study, demonstrating improved recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional gesture recognition systems. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of the impact of environmental factors on system performance.
