Ad-hoc search systems rely on users to formulate effective queries, but this can be a challenging task, especially for complex information needs. This paper presents a novel approach to leveraging query reformulation patterns to improve retrieval performance. We propose a graph-based model that captures the relationships between query reformulations and their corresponding search results. Our approach incorporates both syntactic and semantic features to identify effective reformulations and rerank the search results accordingly. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc search dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for difficult queries.
