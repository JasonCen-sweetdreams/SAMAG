earableSense is a novel wearable system that leverages machine learning and multimodal sensing to detect emotional states in real-time. Our system combines physiological signals from electrodermal activity, heart rate, and facial expressions to recognize emotional patterns. We introduce a context-aware framework that incorporates environmental and social factors, enhancing the system's accuracy and robustness. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that earableSense achieves an average F1-score of 0.92 in detecting four primary emotions, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. Our system has significant implications for mental health monitoring, personalized recommendation systems, and human-computer interaction.
