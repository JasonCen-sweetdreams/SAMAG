The proliferation of IoT devices and social media has led to an exponential growth in multidimensional data. However, existing query optimization techniques for NoSQL databases are inadequate for efficient processing of range queries. This paper proposes a novel cost-based optimization framework, 'RangeOpt', which leverages statistical correlations and data distribution insights to minimize query latency. Our approach integrates a probabilistic indexing scheme with a machine learning-based query planner to select the most efficient query execution plan. Experimental results on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that RangeOpt achieves up to 3x speedup over state-of-the-art optimization techniques for multidimensional range queries.
