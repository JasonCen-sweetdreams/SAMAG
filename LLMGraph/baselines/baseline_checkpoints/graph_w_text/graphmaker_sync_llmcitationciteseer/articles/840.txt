This paper proposes a novel decentralized optimization framework for coordinating multi-robot systems using agent-based methods. Our approach leverages a distributed optimization algorithm, which enables each robot to make decisions based on local information and communicate with its neighbors to achieve a global objective. We evaluate the performance of our framework using a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, demonstrating improved convergence rates and robustness compared to traditional centralized optimization methods. The proposed framework has potential applications in various domains, including disaster response, environmental monitoring, and surveillance.
