Gesture recognition is a crucial aspect of virtual reality (VR) systems, but accuracy can be affected by various factors, including sensory feedback. This study investigates the role of haptic feedback in enhancing gesture recognition accuracy in VR environments. We designed an experiment using a custom-built VR system with integrated haptic feedback and collected data from 30 participants performing a series of gestures. Our results show that the inclusion of haptic feedback significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy, especially for complex gestures. We also identify key factors influencing the effectiveness of haptic feedback, including feedback latency and gesture speed.
