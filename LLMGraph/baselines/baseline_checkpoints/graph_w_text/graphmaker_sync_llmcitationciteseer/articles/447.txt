Distributed database systems are critical for modern data-intensive applications, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'AdaOpt', which leverages machine learning and statistical models to adapt to changing workloads and data distributions. AdaOpt incorporates a scalable, hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify optimal query plans, and a reinforcement learning module to continuously refine the optimization process. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that AdaOpt achieves up to 3x performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
