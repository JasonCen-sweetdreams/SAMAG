In decentralized multi-agent systems, coordination and trust remain significant challenges. This paper proposes a blockchain-based reputation system, 'RepuChain', which enables agents to evaluate and reward reliable behavior in their peers. RepuChain leverages smart contracts to maintain a tamper-proof reputation ledger, ensuring that agents are incentivized to act cooperatively. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RepuChain in a simulated supply chain management scenario, showing improved collaboration and reduced malicious behavior compared to traditional reputation systems. Our approach has implications for decentralized autonomy in various domains, including IoT and edge computing.
