Cooperative learning in multi-agent systems is challenging due to the complex interactions between agents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) framework that enables agents to learn cooperative strategies in a decentralized manner. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent interactions and hierarchical representations to capture complex dependencies. We evaluate HAGNN on a range of cooperative tasks, including multi-agent navigation and resource allocation, and demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods. The proposed framework has potential applications in autonomous systems, robotics, and smart cities.
