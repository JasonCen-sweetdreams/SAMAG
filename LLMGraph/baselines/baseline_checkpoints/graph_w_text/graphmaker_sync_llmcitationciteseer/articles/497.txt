With the increasing prevalence of big data and cloud computing, heterogeneous database systems have become a norm. However, query optimization in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel distributed query optimization framework, 'HeteroOpt', which leverages machine learning and graph-based models to optimize query plans across disparate database systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HeteroOpt through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, showcasing improvements in query response time and resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
