Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on simplistic term weighting schemes. This paper explores the integration of deep neural embeddings with QE to improve retrieval effectiveness. We propose a novel framework, 'EmbExpan', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate contextualized term representations. These embeddings are then combined with a weighted term ranking algorithm to produce an expanded query. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain over state-of-the-art QE methods.
