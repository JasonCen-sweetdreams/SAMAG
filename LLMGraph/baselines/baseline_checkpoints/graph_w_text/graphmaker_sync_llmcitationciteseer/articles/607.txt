Traditional neural ranking models for information retrieval (IR) often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural document ranking framework that leverages hyperbolic embeddings to efficiently model complex document relationships. Our approach, called HyDR, learns a hierarchical representation of documents in hyperbolic space, enabling fast and accurate retrieval of relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyDR outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models while reducing computational costs by up to 40%.
