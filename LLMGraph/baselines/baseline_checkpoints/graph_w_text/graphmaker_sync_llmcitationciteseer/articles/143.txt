Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants, are increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility remains a concern for older adults with hearing impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an accessible conversational interface, 'HearMe', tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of semi-structured interviews and co-design workshops with older adults to identify key barriers and preferences. Our findings informed the design of HearMe, which incorporates audio enhancement, visual feedback, and adaptive dialogue management. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in comprehension, satisfaction, and overall experience compared to existing voice assistants.
