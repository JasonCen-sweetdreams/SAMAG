Virtual reality (VR) technology has seen significant advancements in recent years, but the lack of personalized avatars hinders user immersion. This study investigates the effect of tailoring avatars to individual users' physical characteristics, preferences, and behavioral traits on their VR experience. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, employing a mixed-methods approach to assess user engagement, presence, and satisfaction. The results show that personalized avatars lead to a significant increase in user satisfaction and presence, while also reducing feelings of discomfort and anxiety. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems and highlight avenues for future research.
