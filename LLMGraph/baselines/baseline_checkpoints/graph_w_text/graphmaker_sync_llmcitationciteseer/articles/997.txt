The increasing adoption of column-store databases for real-time analytics poses significant query optimization challenges. This paper presents 'CQN', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and graph-based methods to minimize query latency. CQN incorporates a cost-based optimization strategy that considers both data distribution and storage layouts, as well as a lightweight neural network to predict query execution times. Experimental evaluations on a 100-node cluster demonstrate that CQN outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 3.5x in query response times, while maintaining comparable resource utilization.
