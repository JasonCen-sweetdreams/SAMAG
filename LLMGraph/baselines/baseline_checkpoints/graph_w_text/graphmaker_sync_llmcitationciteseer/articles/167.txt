Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based applications. However, their computation is often hindered by the large scale of real-world graphs. This paper introduces 'HierGNN', a novel hierarchical clustering framework that efficiently processes large graphs by recursively aggregating node representations. Our approach leverages a density-based clustering algorithm to group nodes into hierarchical communities, reducing the computational complexity of GNNs. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that HierGNN achieves significant speedups while maintaining competitive performance with existing GNN models.
