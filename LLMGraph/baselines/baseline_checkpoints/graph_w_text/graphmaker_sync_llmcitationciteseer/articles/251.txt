In modern manufacturing systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects production efficiency and adaptability. This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation using autonomous agents, which can dynamically adjust to changes in the production environment. Our proposed framework, 'AgentMAP', leverages a decentralized multi-agent system to allocate tasks based on real-time resource availability and production constraints. We evaluate AgentMAP using a simulation-based case study of a flexible manufacturing system and demonstrate improved production throughput and adaptability compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
