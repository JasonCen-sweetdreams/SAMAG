This paper explores the application of multi-agent reinforcement learning to real-time traffic signal control. We propose a decentralized framework, 'TrafficMA', where each agent represents a traffic signal controller that learns to optimize traffic flow by interacting with neighboring agents. TrafficMA employs a novel, graph-based state representation that captures the spatial and temporal dependencies of traffic patterns. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that TrafficMA outperforms traditional, centralized optimization methods and adapts effectively to changing traffic conditions.
