Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults, but existing systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing accessible gesture recognition systems tailored to older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify key challenges and opportunities for gesture-based interaction. Our findings inform the development of a novel gesture recognition algorithm that adapts to age-related motor skill declines and cognitive impairments. We evaluate our system through a usability study, demonstrating improved recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
