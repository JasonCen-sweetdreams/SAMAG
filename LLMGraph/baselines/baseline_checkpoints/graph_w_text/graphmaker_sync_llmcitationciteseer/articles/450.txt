Autonomous multi-agent systems (AMAS) have been increasingly applied to various domains, such as robotics, traffic management, and smart grids. Task allocation is a critical problem in AMAS, where agents need to be assigned to tasks efficiently and adaptively. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the complex dependencies between agents and tasks. We design a GNN-based algorithm that enables agents to communicate and negotiate with each other to achieve optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated traffic management scenario demonstrate the scalability and adaptability of our approach in dynamic environments.
