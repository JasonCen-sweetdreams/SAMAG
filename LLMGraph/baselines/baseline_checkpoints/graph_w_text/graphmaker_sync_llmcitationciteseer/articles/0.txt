Modern column stores have revolutionized analytical workloads, but optimizing queries remains a challenging task. This paper presents 'ColSel', a novel framework that leverages machine learning to select the most effective indexes for a given query. By training a neural network on a dataset of query patterns and index statistics, ColSel can predict the optimal index configuration for a query, reducing the overhead of index creation and maintenance. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that ColSel outperforms existing rule-based index selection methods by up to 3x, while also providing insights into the underlying query patterns.
