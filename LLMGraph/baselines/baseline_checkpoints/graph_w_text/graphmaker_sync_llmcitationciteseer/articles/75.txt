Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) aim to provide transparent and interpretable suggestions to users. While existing ERS methods focus on modeling user-item interactions, they often neglect the complex relationships between items. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that captures both user preferences and item relationships. HAN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant items and their attributes, generating personalized explanations for each recommendation. Our experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
