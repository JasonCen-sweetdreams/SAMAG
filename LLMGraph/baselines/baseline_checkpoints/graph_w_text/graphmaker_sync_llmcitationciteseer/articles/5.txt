Multi-agent systems often require coordinated task allocation to achieve efficient and effective collaboration. This paper proposes a novel distributed constraint optimization approach, referred to as D-COORD, to tackle this problem. D-COORD leverages a combination of local search and message-passing algorithms to find near-optimal task assignments that satisfy constraints and minimize conflicts. Experiments on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that D-COORD outperforms existing centralized and decentralized approaches in terms of solution quality, communication overhead, and scalability. Our approach enables the development of more efficient and flexible multi-agent systems in real-world applications.
