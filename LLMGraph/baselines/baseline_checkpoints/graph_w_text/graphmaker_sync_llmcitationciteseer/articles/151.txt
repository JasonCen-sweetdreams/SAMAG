This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT) for multi-agent task allocation, a critical problem in decentralized AI systems. HGAT learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a hierarchical graph, enabling the model to capture complex relationships between agents, tasks, and their allocations. We demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of allocation efficiency and adaptability to changing task requirements. Experimental results on a large-scale drone surveillance scenario show that HGAT-based allocation policies reduce mission completion time by up to 30% compared to traditional optimization-based approaches.
