Query optimization is a critical component in distributed databases, as it directly affects the performance and scalability of the system. Traditional query optimization methods rely on rule-based or cost-based approaches, which may not adapt well to complex and dynamic database environments. This paper explores the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to query optimization in distributed databases. We propose a novel DRL framework, 'QOptRL', which learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database environment and receiving feedback in the form of execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that QOptRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
