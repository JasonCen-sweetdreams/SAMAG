Traditional query expansion techniques rely on manual feature engineering and heuristic-based approaches. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based method for semantic query expansion, dubbed 'DeepQE'. By leveraging pre-trained language models and a neural ranking framework, DeepQE learns to identify relevant terms and phrases in the query context, thereby improving the retrieval effectiveness of search engines. Experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and normalised discounted cumulative gain.
