Distributed database systems face significant challenges in maintaining data consistency and availability in the presence of node failures and network partitions. This paper proposes a novel data replication strategy, 'Replex', which leverages a combination of quorum-based replication and asynchronous logging to achieve high availability and fault tolerance. We demonstrate the performance and scalability of Replex through extensive experiments on a large-scale distributed database testbed, showcasing significant improvements over existing replication strategies in terms of write throughput and latency.
