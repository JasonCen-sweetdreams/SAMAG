Task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities need to be assigned to tasks to achieve global objectives. Existing approaches often rely on handcrafted heuristics or traditional optimization methods, which can be computationally expensive and suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for task allocation in multi-agent systems. Our approach leverages a graph neural network to learn a representation of the agent-task graph and a deep Q-network to optimize task assignments. Experimental results on a realistic disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
