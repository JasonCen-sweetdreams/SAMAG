Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to retrieve relevant documents due to the limited query context. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'QueryDX', which leverages query-driven document expansion to enrich the query representation. Our method incorporates a neural query encoder and a document expansion module, which generates additional query terms based on the semantic context of the original query. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that QueryDX improves retrieval performance by 15% compared to state-of-the-art models, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
