Knowledge graph embedding has become a crucial task in various AI applications. However, existing methods often fail to capture complex relationships between entities. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) to efficiently learn knowledge graph embeddings. Our approach leverages multi-level attention mechanisms to focus on relevant entities and relations, resulting in improved embedding quality. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HAN-based method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of link prediction and triplet classification tasks.
