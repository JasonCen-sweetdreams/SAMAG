Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, including education, entertainment, and social interaction. However, user engagement remains a significant challenge in VR environments. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, who were randomly assigned to either a personalized avatar group or a default avatar group. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, including increased time spent in the VR environment and improved task performance. We also analyzed the impact of avatar personalization on user experience and identified key design factors that influence user engagement.
