The increasing complexity of IoT networks necessitates efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper presents a decentralized agent-based approach, where autonomous agents are deployed on IoT devices to negotiate and allocate resources in a peer-to-peer manner. We propose a novel auction-based mechanism that incorporates device-centric utility functions and real-time resource pricing, enabling adaptability to dynamic network conditions. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT testbed demonstrate improved resource utilization and reduced latency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
