Ad-hoc retrieval continues to be a challenging problem in information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, called Neural Expansion (NE), uses a graph-based neural network to learn term embeddings that can effectively capture context and synonyms. We evaluate NE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion methods. Furthermore, we show that NE can be effectively integrated with existing retrieval models to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
