Few-shot learning has gained significant attention in recent years, but existing meta-learning methods often struggle with limited training data. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'AdaptiveMargin', which adaptively adjusts the margin of the classifier based on the complexity of the task. We introduce a meta-learning objective that incorporates a margin-based regularization term, allowing the model to learn more effective task representations. Experimental results on benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that AdaptiveMargin outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improved accuracy and robustness in low-data regimes.
