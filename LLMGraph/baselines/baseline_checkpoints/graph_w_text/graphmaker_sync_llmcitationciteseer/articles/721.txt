Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to improve healthcare communication, but their lack of transparency and explainability hinders trust and adoption. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to create intelligible ECAs that facilitate collaborative decision-making between patients and healthcare providers. We propose a framework that integrates cognitive architectures, natural language processing, and multimodal interaction to enable ECAs to provide clear explanations of their decision-making processes. A user study with 30 participants shows that our approach increases user trust and satisfaction with ECA-mediated healthcare communication.
