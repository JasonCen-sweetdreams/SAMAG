The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation mechanisms. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach based on multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents negotiate and allocate resources in a distributed manner. We propose a hybrid algorithm that combines game-theoretic and machine learning techniques to optimize resource utilization and minimize latency in IoT networks. Experimental results on a simulated IoT testbed demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in adapting to dynamic network conditions and improving overall system performance.
