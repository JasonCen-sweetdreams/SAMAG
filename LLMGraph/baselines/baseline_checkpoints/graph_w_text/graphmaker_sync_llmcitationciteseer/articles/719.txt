Real-time data warehouses require efficient query optimization to support fast and accurate decision-making. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'COIX', which leverages column-store indexing to reduce query latency. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that considers both data compression and storage layout to minimize I/O operations. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that COIX achieves an average query performance improvement of 3.5x compared to traditional row-store indexing, while maintaining comparable storage efficiency.
