Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when models are required to generalize to new classes with limited training data. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach, Hierarchical Prototypical Networks (HPN), which leverages a hierarchical structure to learn robust and transferable representations. HPN consists of a nested prototypical network architecture that captures both local and global patterns in the data, enabling effective adaptation to new classes. We demonstrate the efficacy of HPN on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-shot image classification tasks.
