Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. Our approach, called 'RL-QOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan from a large space of possible plans. We evaluate RL-QOpt on a real-world dataset and show that it achieves an average speedup of 2.5x compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
