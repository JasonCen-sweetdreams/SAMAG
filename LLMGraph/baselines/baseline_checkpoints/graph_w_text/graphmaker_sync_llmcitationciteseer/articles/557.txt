Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, especially for short text documents where the initial query may not provide sufficient context. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'DeepQE', which learns to expand the query by identifying relevant terms and phrases from the document collection. We employ a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and document content. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
