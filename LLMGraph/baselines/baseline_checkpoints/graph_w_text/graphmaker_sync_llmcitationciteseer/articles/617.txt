Sentiment analysis is a fundamental task in natural language processing, but existing models often struggle to generalize across diverse domains and datasets. This paper proposes a novel heterogeneous transfer learning framework, 'HTL- Sent', which leverages the strengths of multiple pre-trained models and knowledge graphs to adapt to new domains. Our approach combines adversarial domain adaptation with graph-based attention to selectively transfer knowledge from multiple sources. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HTL-Sent outperforms state-of-the-art models in multi-domain sentiment analysis, achieving an average improvement of 4.5% in accuracy.
