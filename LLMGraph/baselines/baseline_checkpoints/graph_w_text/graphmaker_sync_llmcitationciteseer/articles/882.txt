Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but current designs often fail to account for their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive conversational interfaces for this population. We conducted interviews and usability studies with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments to identify key challenges and design recommendations. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, clarity, and cognitive support in conversational interface design. We propose a set of design guidelines and a prototype system that incorporates these principles, demonstrating improved usability and user experience for older adults with cognitive impairments.
