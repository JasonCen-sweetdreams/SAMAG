Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for timely business decision-making. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages column-store indexing to accelerate query execution. We introduce a cost-based optimization strategy that considers both storage and processing costs, and demonstrate improved performance compared to traditional row-store indexing. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset show that ColOpt reduces query latency by up to 75% while maintaining data freshness.
