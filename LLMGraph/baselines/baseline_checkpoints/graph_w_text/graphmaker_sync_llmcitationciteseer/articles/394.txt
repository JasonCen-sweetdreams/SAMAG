Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments require efficient and adaptive task planning to achieve their objectives. This paper presents a novel hierarchical task planning framework, 'HTP-D', that integrates planning and execution in a unified framework. HTP-D leverages a probabilistic graphical model to represent the environment and agent capabilities, enabling the agent to reason about uncertainty and adapt to changes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HTP-D in a simulated robotic navigation scenario, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced planning times compared to state-of-the-art planning approaches.
