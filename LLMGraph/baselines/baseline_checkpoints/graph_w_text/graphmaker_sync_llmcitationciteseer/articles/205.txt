Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, requiring models to adapt quickly to new classes with limited data. This paper presents a hierarchical meta-learning framework, 'HML-FS', which leverages a novel combination of metric-based and optimization-based meta-learning techniques. HML-FS learns to generate task-specific prototypes and adapt the optimizer's initialization, leading to significant improvements in few-shot classification accuracy on several benchmark datasets. We also provide theoretical insights into the convergence properties of our approach, demonstrating its robustness to varying task distributions.
