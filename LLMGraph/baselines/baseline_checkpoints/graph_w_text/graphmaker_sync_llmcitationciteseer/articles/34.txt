E-commerce search engines rely heavily on query expansion techniques to improve retrieval accuracy. However, traditional methods often fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and products. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'SemExpan', which integrates semantic embeddings into the query expansion process. By leveraging pre-trained language models and product knowledge graphs, SemExpan generates context-aware expansion terms that better align with user intent. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search relevance and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art methods.
