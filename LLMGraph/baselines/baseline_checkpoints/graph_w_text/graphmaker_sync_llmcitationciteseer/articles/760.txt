In multi-agent systems, negotiation protocols enable autonomous agents to reach mutually beneficial agreements. However, real-world scenarios often involve incomplete information, where agents may not have access to the complete state of the environment or the preferences of other agents. This paper proposes a novel distributed negotiation protocol, 'DIP-Negotiate', which extends the traditional alternating offers protocol to accommodate incomplete information. We introduce a probabilistic inference mechanism that enables agents to infer the preferences of other agents based on observed actions and messages. Experimental results on a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate that DIP-Negotiate outperforms existing protocols in terms of negotiation efficiency and fairness, even in the presence of incomplete information.
