Voice assistants have the potential to improve the independence and quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing systems often fall short in accommodating the unique needs of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing an accessible voice assistant, 'EasyVoice', tailored to the cognitive and linguistic abilities of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability studies, resulting in a novel conversation flow and visualization framework that reduces cognitive load and promotes successful task completion. Our evaluation with 25 older adults with cognitive impairments demonstrates significant improvements in task accuracy and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
