Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and develop a deep Q-network-based algorithm to learn an optimal query plan. Our approach takes into account various factors, including data distribution, network latency, and resource availability. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
