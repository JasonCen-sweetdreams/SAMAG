Existing query expansion techniques often struggle to effectively capture domain-specific terminology, leading to suboptimal document retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-SD', which leverages a combination of lexical and semantic features to identify relevant expansion terms. Our method incorporates a domain-specific ontology to disambiguate polysemous terms and contextualize query concepts. Experimental results on a collection of specialized-domain datasets demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
