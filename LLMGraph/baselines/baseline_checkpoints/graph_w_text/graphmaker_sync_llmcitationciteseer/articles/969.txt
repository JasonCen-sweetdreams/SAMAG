Distributed database systems (DDBS) are increasingly used in modern applications, but optimizing query performance remains a challenging problem. This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query performance in DDBS. We propose a novel RL framework, 'QueryOpt', which learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database system. QueryOpt uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given query and database state. Our experiments on a real-world DDBS dataset show that QueryOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average query performance improvement of 30%. We also demonstrate the adaptability of QueryOpt to changing database workloads and query patterns.
