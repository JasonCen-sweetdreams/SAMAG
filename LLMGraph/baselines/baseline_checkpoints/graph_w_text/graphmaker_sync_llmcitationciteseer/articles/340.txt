Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective passage retrieval to provide accurate answers. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) framework, which leverages a two-stage approach to efficiently retrieve relevant passages from a large corpus. Our method first uses a coarse-grained dense retriever to select top-k passages, followed by a fine-grained retriever that re-ranks the passages using a hierarchical interaction mechanism. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR achieves significant improvements in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, while reducing the computational overhead compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
