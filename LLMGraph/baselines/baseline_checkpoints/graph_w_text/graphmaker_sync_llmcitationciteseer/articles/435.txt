Dialogue management in multi-agent systems remains a challenging task, particularly when agents have diverse goals and communication styles. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that models agent interactions and dialogue flows. Our HAN learns to selectively focus on relevant dialogue contexts and agent intentions, enabling more effective and efficient dialogue management. Experimental results on a large-scale multi-agent dialogue dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of dialogue coherence, agent goal achievement, and overall system performance.
