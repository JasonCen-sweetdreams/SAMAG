Autonomous vehicles require efficient decision-making in complex environments. We propose a novel reinforcement learning framework that leverages hierarchical graph attention to model the relationships between road entities. Our approach, 'GRAVITAS', enables the agent to focus on critical regions of the graph, reducing computational overhead and improving navigation performance. Experimental results on a simulated urban driving scenario demonstrate that GRAVITAS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of task completion rate and safety metrics.
