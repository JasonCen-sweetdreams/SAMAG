The proliferation of IoT devices has generated vast amounts of sensor data, posing significant challenges for real-time analytics. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'IoTBoost', designed to accelerate query processing on IoT sensor data. IoTBoost leverages a combination of data partitioning, indexing, and caching techniques to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that IoTBoost outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization approaches by up to 3x, while ensuring low latency and high throughput for real-time analytics.
