Query expansion is a crucial technique for improving the effectiveness of information retrieval systems. However, traditional methods based on term co-occurrence and frequency analysis often suffer from limited contextual understanding. This paper proposes a novel approach, GraphQE, which leverages graph-based embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our method represents the query and document graphs as dense vectors, enabling efficient similarity computation and query expansion. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art methods.
