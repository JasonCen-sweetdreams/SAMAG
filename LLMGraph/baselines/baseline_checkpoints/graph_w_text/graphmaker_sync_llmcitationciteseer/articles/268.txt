Coordinating multi-agent systems (MAS) to achieve complex tasks is a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task network (HTN) approach to coordinate MAS. We introduce a graph-based representation of the task hierarchy, which enables agents to reason about task dependencies and allocate resources efficiently. Our approach is evaluated on a real-world disaster response scenario, where multiple agents must collaborate to rescue people and extinguish fires. Experimental results show that our HTN-based approach outperforms traditional planning-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
