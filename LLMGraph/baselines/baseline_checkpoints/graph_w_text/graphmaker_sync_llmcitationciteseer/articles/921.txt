Data warehousing has become a crucial component of business intelligence, but traditional indexing techniques struggle to keep pace with real-time data ingestion. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'RTIndex', which leverages a combination of column-store indexing, delta encoding, and incremental clustering to facilitate efficient query processing in real-time data warehousing environments. We evaluate RTIndex using the TPC-H benchmark and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing indexing techniques, achieving query response times under 100ms for complex analytics workloads.
