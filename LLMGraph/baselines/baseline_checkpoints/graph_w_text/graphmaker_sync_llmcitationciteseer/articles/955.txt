Traditional information retrieval systems often struggle with capturing nuanced semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HNRM-QE', which leverages query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. By incorporating a dense passage retriever and a reranker with a hierarchical attention mechanism, HNRM-QE achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets. We demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing neural ranking models, especially for complex, open-domain queries.
