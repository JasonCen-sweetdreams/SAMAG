Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While existing methods often rely on hand-crafted features or supervised learning, we propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our approach leverages the graph structure of time series data to capture complex patterns and relationships. The hierarchical architecture enables the model to learn both local and global features, improving detection performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in identifying anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
