Cold-start recommendation, where user or item interactions are scarce, remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) framework, 'HetRec', which leverages multiple types of relationships between users, items, and attributes. We design a meta-learning based approach to adapt the HGNN to new, unseen items, and demonstrate its effectiveness in cold-start scenarios. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that HetRec outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios with extreme sparsity.
