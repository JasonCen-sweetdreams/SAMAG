Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in stroke rehabilitation, but the impact of personalized avatars on user engagement and motor skill recovery is not well understood. This study explores the effectiveness of customizable, anthropomorphic avatars in a VR-based stroke rehabilitation system. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Results show that participants in the personalized avatar group demonstrated significant improvements in arm mobility and cognitive function compared to the generic avatar group. Additionally, users with personalized avatars reported higher levels of motivation and enjoyment during the rehabilitation process.
