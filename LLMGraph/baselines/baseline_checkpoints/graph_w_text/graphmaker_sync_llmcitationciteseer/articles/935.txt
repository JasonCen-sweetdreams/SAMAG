In dynamic environments, task allocation among agents is a challenging problem due to the need to adapt to changing conditions and optimize performance. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages self-organizing agents to allocate tasks efficiently. We introduce a distributed, auction-based mechanism that enables agents to bid on tasks based on their current workload, capabilities, and environmental factors. Experiments in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and adaptability to changes in the environment.
