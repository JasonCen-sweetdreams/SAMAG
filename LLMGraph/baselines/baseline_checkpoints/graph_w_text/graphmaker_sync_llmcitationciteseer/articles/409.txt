Individuals with motor impairments often face significant barriers when interacting with modern computing devices. This paper presents a novel, adaptive gesture-based interface designed to accommodate users with varying levels of motor ability. Our approach leverages machine learning to dynamically adjust gesture recognition thresholds, enabling users to accurately interact with devices despite physical limitations. A user study involving 20 participants with motor impairments demonstrates significant improvements in interface usability and user satisfaction compared to traditional gesture-based interfaces.
