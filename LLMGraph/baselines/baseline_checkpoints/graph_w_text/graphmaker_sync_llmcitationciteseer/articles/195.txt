Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but often suffer from limited query representation capacity. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'KG-Expan', which leverages knowledge graph embeddings to enrich query representations. We incorporate entity disambiguation and relation inference to generate high-quality expansion terms, and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness on several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we show that KG-Expan can be seamlessly integrated with existing neural retrieval models, making it a versatile and practical solution for real-world IR applications.
