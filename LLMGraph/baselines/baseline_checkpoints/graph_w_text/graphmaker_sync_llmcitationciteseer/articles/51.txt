Query expansion techniques play a crucial role in enhancing the performance of information retrieval systems. However, existing methods often rely on simplistic term-weighting schemes, neglecting the nuanced relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HIER', which leverages hierarchical embeddings to capture semantic dependencies between query terms. By representing queries as dense, hierarchical vectors, HIER enables more effective expansion of query terms, leading to improved retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HIER over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
