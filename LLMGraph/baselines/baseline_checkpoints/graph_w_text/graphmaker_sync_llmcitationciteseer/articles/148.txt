Personalized icon design has gained popularity as a means to enhance user experience in mobile apps. However, its impact on user engagement remains understudied. This paper presents a large-scale study examining the effect of personalized icon design on mobile app engagement metrics, including session duration, interaction frequency, and abandonment rates. We developed a novel icon personalization framework that incorporates user behavior, preferences, and visual aesthetics. Our results show that personalized icon design significantly improves engagement metrics, particularly among users with high novelty-seeking tendencies. We discuss the implications of our findings for HCI practitioners and researchers.
