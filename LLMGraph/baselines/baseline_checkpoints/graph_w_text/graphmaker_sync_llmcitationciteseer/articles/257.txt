Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval from a large corpus to answer user queries. Existing dense passage retrieval (DPR) models suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. We propose Hierarchical DPR (HDPR), a novel approach that leverages hierarchical representations to reduce the dimensionality of passage embeddings. Our method employs a coarse-grained retriever to select top-k passages and a fine-grained reranker to re-score the retrieved passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDPR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational costs by 75% compared to standard DPR models.
