Short-text retrieval is a fundamental task in modern search engines, where queries often lack sufficient context. This paper introduces a novel adaptive context-aware query expansion framework, 'ACE', which leverages semantic embeddings and attention mechanisms to incorporate relevant contextual information. ACE adaptively adjusts the weight of expansion terms based on the query's ambiguity and the user's search intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ACE achieves significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and relevance compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
