Real-time analytics on distributed column-stores is crucial for various applications, including IoT and financial services. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'RIO', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning-based cost modeling and dynamic reordering of join operations. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world column-store system demonstrates that RIO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3.5x in terms of query latency and 2.2x in terms of resource utilization. We also provide a theoretical analysis of RIO's performance guarantees under varying data distributions and query workloads.
