Ad-hoc search systems rely on query expansion to improve retrieval performance. Traditional methods employ hand-crafted rules and thesauri, which can be brittle and domain-specific. This paper proposes a novel neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuroQE', which learns to expand queries by capturing semantic relationships between terms. We leverage a large-scale corpus to train a neural network that maps terms to dense vectors, and then use these vectors to generate expansion terms. Experiments on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of MAP and NDCG, while requiring minimal domain knowledge and tuning.
