Multi-agent systems often require efficient task allocation to achieve complex goals. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for cooperative task allocation, dubbed 'CATARINA'. By leveraging graph neural networks and attention mechanisms, CATARINA enables agents to learn effective task assignments and coordination strategies in dynamic environments. We evaluate CATARINA in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.
