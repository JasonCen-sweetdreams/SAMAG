In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'DRL-TA', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in real-time. Each agent learns to select tasks based on its local observations, and a decentralized communication protocol enables information sharing and coordination among agents. We evaluate DRL-TA on a simulated search and rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional auction-based methods.
