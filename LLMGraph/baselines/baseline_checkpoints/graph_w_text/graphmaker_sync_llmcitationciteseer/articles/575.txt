Multi-tenant database systems cater to diverse workloads, leading to complex query optimization challenges. This paper presents a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, 'QueryOpt', that adapts to dynamic workload patterns and optimizes query execution plans. QueryOpt leverages a Deep Q-Network to learn a policy that balances query performance and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world benchmark demonstrate that QueryOpt achieves up to 30% improvement in query response times and 25% reduction in resource consumption compared to traditional optimization techniques.
