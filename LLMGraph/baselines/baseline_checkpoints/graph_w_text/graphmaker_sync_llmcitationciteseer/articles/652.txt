Query expansion is a crucial component in search engines, but its computational overhead can significantly impact query response times. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'QEIndex', that facilitates efficient query expansion for real-time search applications. By leveraging a combination of term co-occurrence analysis and clustering-based document representation, QEIndex reduces the number of candidate expansion terms while preserving retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate a 3x reduction in query expansion latency compared to state-of-the-art techniques, making QEIndex a promising solution for modern search engines.
