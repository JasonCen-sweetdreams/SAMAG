Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complexity of patent documents and the ambiguity of search queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to improve patent retrieval performance. Our method, called DeepQE, uses a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn a dense representation of patent documents and expand search queries with relevant terms. Experiments on a large patent dataset show that DeepQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 25% increase in recall and a 15% increase in precision.
