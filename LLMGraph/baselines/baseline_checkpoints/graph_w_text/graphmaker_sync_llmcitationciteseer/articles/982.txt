Time series forecasting is a crucial task in many applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages graph-based representations to model complex temporal dependencies. HGAT uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to identify relevant time series components and their interactions, providing interpretable insights into forecasting decisions. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of forecasting accuracy while offering improved model interpretability.
