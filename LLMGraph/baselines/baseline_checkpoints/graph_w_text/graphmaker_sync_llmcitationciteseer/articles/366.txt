As the global population ages, it is essential to design interfaces that are accessible and usable for older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a gesture-based interface designed specifically for this population, with a focus on reducing cognitive load and improving usability. We conducted a user-centered design process, involving co-design workshops and usability testing with older adults, to develop a novel gesture set and interface layout. Our evaluation results show that the proposed interface significantly improves task completion time and reduces errors compared to traditional touchscreen interfaces, demonstrating the potential of gesture-based interfaces to enhance accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments.
