Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. While deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that detects anomalies while providing explanations for its predictions. Our HAN model consists of a hierarchical encoder that captures both local and global patterns in the time-series data, followed by an attention mechanism that highlights the most relevant features contributing to the anomaly score. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting anomalies while providing insights into the decision-making process.
