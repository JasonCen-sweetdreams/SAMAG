This study explores the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR)-based gesture recognition systems. We designed an experimental framework that utilizes VR to simulate real-world scenarios, while participants performed gestures with varying levels of embodiment. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly enhances gesture recognition accuracy, particularly in scenarios requiring fine-grained motor control. We also observed a positive correlation between embodiment and user engagement. These findings have implications for the design of more effective and engaging gesture-based interfaces in VR applications.
