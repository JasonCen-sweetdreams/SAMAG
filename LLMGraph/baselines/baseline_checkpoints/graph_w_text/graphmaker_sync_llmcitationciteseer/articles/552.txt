Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents need to coordinate to achieve common goals. This paper presents a decentralized coalition formation algorithm, called CoFoTAS, which enables agents to dynamically form coalitions and allocate tasks based on their capabilities and availability. CoFoTAS leverages a distributed constraint optimization framework to ensure that the formed coalitions are feasible and efficient. Experimental results on a logistics transportation scenario demonstrate that CoFoTAS outperforms existing decentralized task allocation algorithms in terms of solution quality and scalability.
