Modern recommendation systems rely on graph-based models to capture complex user-item relationships. However, these models often struggle with scalability and suffer from over-smoothing issues. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture, which leverages a hierarchical graph structure to model user and item relationships at multiple scales. By incorporating attention mechanisms and a novel graph pooling strategy, HGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while reducing computational complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in a realistic recommendation system and discuss its potential for large-scale industrial applications.
