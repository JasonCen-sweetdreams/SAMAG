Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach that leverages the structural properties of query graphs to efficiently prune unnecessary joins and reduce query execution time. Our approach is designed to work with various query optimization techniques and is adaptable to different data distribution scenarios. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization methods by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
