Short-text retrieval is a challenging problem in information retrieval due to the limited context and ambiguity of query terms. This paper presents a novel query expansion method that leverages graph-based keyword embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our approach constructs a graph of co-occurring keywords and uses graph convolutional networks to learn dense representations of query terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, particularly for short queries with fewer than five terms.
