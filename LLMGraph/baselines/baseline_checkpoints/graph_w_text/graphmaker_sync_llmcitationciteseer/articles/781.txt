This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, enabling them to dynamically form coalitions and allocate tasks in complex, dynamic environments. We leverage graph theory to model agent relationships and propose a distributed algorithm, 'GraphCoalition', which enables agents to negotiate and form coalitions based on their capabilities and task requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphCoalition outperforms traditional centralized task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utility, while maintaining scalability and robustness in the presence of agent failures.
