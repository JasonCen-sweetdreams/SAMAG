In decentralized multi-agent systems, coordinating autonomous agents to achieve a common goal is a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel blockchain-based approach to incentivize agents to cooperate and make decisions that benefit the overall system. We design a decentralized coordination mechanism that leverages smart contracts to facilitate the exchange of rewards and penalties between agents. Our approach ensures that agents are motivated to behave honestly and contribute to the system's overall utility. Experimental results demonstrate that our mechanism outperforms traditional centralized coordination methods in terms of efficiency and fairness.
