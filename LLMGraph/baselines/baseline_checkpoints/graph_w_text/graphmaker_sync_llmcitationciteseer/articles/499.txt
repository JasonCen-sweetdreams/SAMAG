Virtual reality (VR) has shown immense potential in various domains, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We designed and implemented a novel avatar customization framework, incorporating real-time facial recognition and machine learning-based preference modeling. Our user study involving 100 participants reveals that personalized avatars significantly enhance user engagement, with increased feelings of presence and enjoyment. We discuss the implications of our findings and propose future research directions for personalized VR systems.
