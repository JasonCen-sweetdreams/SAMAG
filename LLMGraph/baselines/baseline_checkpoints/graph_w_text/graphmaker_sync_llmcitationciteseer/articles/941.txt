This paper proposes a decentralized, multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for autonomous traffic signal control. We model each traffic signal as an autonomous agent, and utilize a decentralized deep Q-network (DDQN) to learn optimal control policies. Our approach allows agents to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions and communicate with neighboring agents to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. Simulation results on a realistic traffic network demonstrate improved performance compared to traditional, centralized control methods, with a 23% reduction in average travel time and a 17% decrease in congestion.
