Virtual reality (VR) technology has enabled the development of gesture recognition systems that can be used in various applications. However, the lack of tactile feedback can lead to user frustration and decreased performance. This study investigates the effect of visual feedback on user experience in VR-based gesture recognition. We designed a VR system that provides users with real-time visual cues about their gesture accuracy and compared it to a system without feedback. Our results show that visual feedback significantly improves user performance, reduces error rates, and enhances overall user experience. We also found that users with prior VR experience benefited more from visual feedback than novice users.
