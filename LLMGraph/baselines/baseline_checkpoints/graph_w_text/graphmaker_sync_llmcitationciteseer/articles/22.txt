Temporal graph forecasting is a crucial task in many real-world applications, such as traffic prediction and disease spread modeling. However, existing methods often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying dynamics. We propose Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN-Forecast), a novel framework that incorporates hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes, edges, and timestamps. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while providing explainable predictions through attention visualization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN-Forecast in a case study on traffic flow prediction, showcasing its potential for real-world deployment.
