The rapid growth of visual data has made image retrieval a challenging task, particularly in large-scale databases. This paper proposes a novel deep semantic hashing (DSH) approach that learns compact binary codes for efficient image retrieval. Our method leverages a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes image representation, semantic embedding, and hash code generation. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that our DSH approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy, while reducing storage requirements and improving query efficiency.
