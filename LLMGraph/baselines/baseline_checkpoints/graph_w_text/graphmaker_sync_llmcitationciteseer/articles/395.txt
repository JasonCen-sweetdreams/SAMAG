Personalized recommendation systems often suffer from a lack of diversity in their suggested items. This paper introduces a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) model that tackles this issue by incorporating both item-level and user-level graph attention mechanisms. HGAT adaptively captures complex relationships between users, items, and their associated attributes, leading to improved recommendation diversity and novelty. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art methods in terms of diversity metrics while maintaining competitive performance in terms of accuracy and ranking metrics.
