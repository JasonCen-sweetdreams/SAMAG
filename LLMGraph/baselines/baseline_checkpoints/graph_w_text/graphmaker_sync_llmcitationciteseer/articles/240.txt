Deep neural networks are prone to errors when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Existing methods for OOD detection often rely on complex and computationally expensive techniques. This paper proposes a novel approach based on hierarchical Gaussian mixture models (HGMMs) that can efficiently detect OOD samples. Our method leverages the hierarchical structure of HGMMs to model the underlying data distribution and identify anomalies. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting OOD samples while achieving significant speedups over existing methods.
