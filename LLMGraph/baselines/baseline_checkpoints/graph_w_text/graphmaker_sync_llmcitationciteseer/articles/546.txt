As autonomous systems become increasingly pervasive, it is essential to develop explainable planning mechanisms that provide transparency into their decision-making processes. This paper presents a novel hierarchical task network (HTN) framework, XPlan, which integrates symbolic planning with neural networks to generate interpretable plans for autonomous agents. XPlan leverages a hierarchical representation of tasks to identify relevant sub-goals and generate visual explanations for the planned actions. We evaluate XPlan in a simulated autonomous driving scenario, demonstrating improved explainability and planning efficiency compared to traditional planning approaches.
