Query expansion is a crucial step in medical information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents from large biomedical databases. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion framework, 'MedExpan', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of medical concepts. We introduce a multi-task learning approach that jointly optimizes query expansion and document ranking, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-CDS dataset demonstrate that MedExpan outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly for complex clinical queries.
