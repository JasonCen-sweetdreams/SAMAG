Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed graph databases. Our method, called GraphQLearn, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan from a set of possible execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that GraphQLearn outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
