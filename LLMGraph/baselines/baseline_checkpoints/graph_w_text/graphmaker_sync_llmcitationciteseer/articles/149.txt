In multi-agent systems, trust management is crucial for ensuring reliable interactions and decision-making. This paper proposes a decentralized trust management framework, 'BlockTrust', which leverages blockchain technology to establish a transparent and tamper-proof reputation mechanism. BlockTrust enables agents to rate and evaluate each other's behavior, and reputation scores are stored on a blockchain, allowing for secure and efficient trust computation. We evaluate the performance of BlockTrust in a simulated multi-agent environment, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting and mitigating malicious behavior.
