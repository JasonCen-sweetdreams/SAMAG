Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when faced with novel tasks and limited data. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning approach, 'AdaptiveTaskEmbed', which leverages task embeddings to capture the underlying relationships between tasks. Our approach adaptively updates task embeddings based on the support set, allowing the model to better generalize to unseen tasks. We evaluate our method on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods.
