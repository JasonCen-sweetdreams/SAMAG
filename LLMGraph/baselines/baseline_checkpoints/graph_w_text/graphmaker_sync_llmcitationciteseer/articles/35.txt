Virtual reality (VR) systems often struggle to provide an optimal user experience due to the lack of nuanced user input. This paper presents an innovative approach to leveraging eye-gaze tracking to create an adaptive interface that dynamically responds to user attention and intentions. Our system, 'GazeGuide', uses machine learning-driven gaze analysis to infer user goals and adjust the virtual environment accordingly. We conducted a user study demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction when using GazeGuide compared to traditional VR interfaces.
