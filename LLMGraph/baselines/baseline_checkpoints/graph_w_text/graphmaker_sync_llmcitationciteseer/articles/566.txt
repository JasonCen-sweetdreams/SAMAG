Passage retrieval is a crucial step in open-domain question answering systems, requiring accurate ranking of relevant passages. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and passages. Our model incorporates a multi-head self-attention mechanism to capture complex contextual relationships between query terms and passage content. Experimental results on the TREC CAR dataset demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 12% improvement in mean average precision.
