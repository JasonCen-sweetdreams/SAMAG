Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in data integration and knowledge graph construction. Existing approaches often suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large datasets. This paper proposes a novel entity disambiguation framework, 'EDEmbed', which leverages knowledge graph embeddings and graph attention mechanisms to efficiently disambiguate entities. We introduce a hierarchical attention scheme that captures both local and global context, enabling accurate disambiguation even in the presence of noisy or incomplete data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EDEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
