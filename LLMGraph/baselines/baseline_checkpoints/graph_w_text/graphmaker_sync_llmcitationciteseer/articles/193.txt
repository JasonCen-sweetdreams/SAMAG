As distributed databases increasingly support multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) for improved transactional throughput, query optimization becomes a critical challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MVCCO', which leverages a combination of static analysis, runtime profiling, and machine learning-based prediction to identify optimal query execution plans for MVCC-enabled databases. Our experimental evaluation on a benchmark dataset demonstrates that MVCCO reduces average query latency by up to 35% compared to existing optimization techniques, while maintaining strong consistency and correctness guarantees.
