Recommendation systems have become ubiquitous in modern e-commerce, but their opacity hinders user trust and understanding. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework for explainable recommendation systems. Our approach leverages multi-level attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant user and item features, generating interpretable explanations for recommended items. We evaluate our HAN model on three real-world datasets, demonstrating improved recommendation accuracy and explanatory power compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
