High-dimensional data indexing is crucial for efficient query processing in various applications. Existing indexing techniques, such as k-d trees and ball trees, often suffer from the curse of dimensionality. This paper introduces a novel indexing approach, 'HierGrid', which leverages hierarchical grids to partition the data space. By adaptively adjusting the grid resolution and pruning irrelevant regions, HierGrid significantly reduces the indexing time and improves query performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HierGrid outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, particularly in high-dimensional spaces.
