Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various node classification tasks. However, they often require large amounts of labeled data, which can be scarce in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention-based GNN framework, HAGNN, that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs for few-shot node classification. We introduce a novel meta-learning objective that adapts the attention weights to the target task, enabling the model to generalize to unseen graphs and classes. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN in few-shot node classification scenarios.
