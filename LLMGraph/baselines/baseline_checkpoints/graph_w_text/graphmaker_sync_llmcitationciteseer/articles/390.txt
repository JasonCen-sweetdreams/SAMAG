Task allocation is a critical problem in multi-agent systems, especially in dynamic environments where agent capabilities and task requirements change over time. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt task allocation policies in real-time. Our method, 'MATA-RL', uses a decentralized, multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to optimize task assignments based on agent expertise, task urgency, and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MATA-RL in a simulated disaster response scenario, showcasing improved response times, reduced task failures, and enhanced overall system resilience.
