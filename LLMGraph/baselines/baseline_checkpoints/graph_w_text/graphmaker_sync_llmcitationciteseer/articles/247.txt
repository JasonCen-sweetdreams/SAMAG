Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a crucial task in various AI applications. However, existing methods often neglect the hierarchical structure inherent in many knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a novel KGE approach, 'HierAtt', which leverages hierarchical attention networks to capture both local and global relationships between entities. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierAtt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of link prediction and entity classification tasks, while reducing the number of required model parameters.
