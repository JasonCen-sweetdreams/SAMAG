As voice assistants become increasingly prevalent in smart homes, older adults face unique challenges in using these systems. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an accessible voice assistant tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 participants, aged 65-85, to identify pain points and design preferences. Our findings highlight the importance of intuitive voice commands, personalized feedback, and visual cues to support cognitive impairments. We propose a novel architecture integrating these features and evaluate its usability and accessibility using the W3C's Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.
