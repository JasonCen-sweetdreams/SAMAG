Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query formulations. We propose a hierarchical query expansion framework, RLEXPAND, that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query refinement. RLEXPAND models the query expansion process as a Markov decision process, learning to iteratively refine queries by selecting relevant terms and phrases from a hierarchical representation of the document collection. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for challenging, ambiguity-prone queries.
