Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to retrieve relevant documents due to incomplete or imperfect query representations. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, QEDEX, which leverages contextualized embeddings to enrich the query and document representations. QEDEX adaptively selects the most informative terms from the top-ranked documents to augment the original query, thereby improving the retrieval effectiveness. Our experiments on the TREC-COVID dataset demonstrate that QEDEX outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
