Neural search engines have gained popularity in recent years, but their performance is often limited by the quality of the query representation. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of expansion terms. Our approach, dubbed 'ReinforceQE', uses a neural agent to learn a policy for selecting expansion terms based on their expected impact on retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ReinforceQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, leading to significant improvements in search accuracy and efficiency.
