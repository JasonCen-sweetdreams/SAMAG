Time-series databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large amounts of temporal data. However, optimizing query performance for these databases remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for time-series databases. Our approach, dubbed 'TSRLE', uses a Markov decision process to model the query optimization problem and learns to optimize query plans using a deep Q-network. Experimental results on a real-world time-series dataset demonstrate that TSRLE outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
