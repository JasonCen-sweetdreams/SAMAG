Query optimization is a crucial task in relational databases, but existing methods often rely on hand-crafted heuristics or expensive search procedures. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn query optimization strategies. We represent query plans as graphs and train a GNN model to predict the optimal execution plan. Our experiments on a suite of benchmark queries demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers in terms of query execution time and plan quality. We also explore the interpretability of our model, providing insights into the decision-making process of the optimizer.
