Coordinating heterogeneous agents in dynamic environments is a challenging task, particularly when dealing with complex tasks that require cooperation and adaptability. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical task graph (HTG) framework that enables efficient coordination of agents with diverse capabilities and goals. We propose a decentralized planning algorithm that leverages HTGs to generate adaptive plans, which are then executed by the agents in a distributed manner. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, where HTGs improved coordination efficiency by 35% compared to traditional flat task graphs.
