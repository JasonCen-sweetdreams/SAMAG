Virtual assistants have become ubiquitous, but their reactive nature often leads to frustration and inefficiency. This paper presents a novel approach to proactive virtual assistance by detecting users' intentions through gaze patterns. We develop a machine learning model that leverages eye-tracking data to predict user goals and desires, allowing the virtual assistant to take preemptive actions. Our user study reveals that our gaze-based intention detection system achieves an accuracy of 87.3% and improves overall user satisfaction by 35.2%. The system's applicability is demonstrated in a smart home scenario, where it enables more efficient and personalized automation.
