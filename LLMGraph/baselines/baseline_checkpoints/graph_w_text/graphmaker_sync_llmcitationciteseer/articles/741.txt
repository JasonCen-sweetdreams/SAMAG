In multi-agent systems, social influence can significantly impact the emergence of global behavior. This paper introduces a novel framework for coordinating agents using norm-based social influence. We propose a probabilistic model that captures the dynamics of social influence, and develop a decentralized algorithm for agents to adapt to changing norms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a series of simulations, showcasing its ability to promote cooperation and achieve system-level goals in complex, dynamic environments.
