Distributed search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from a massive, geographically dispersed corpus. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-DSE', which leverages both local and global term statistics to generate context-aware query representations. Our method adaptively selects relevant terms from a hierarchical vocabulary graph, allowing for more effective pruning of irrelevant documents and improved retrieval efficiency. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HQE-DSE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of both retrieval accuracy and query latency.
