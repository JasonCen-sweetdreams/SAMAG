Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, which aims to enhance the retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. Traditional methods rely on statistical techniques, but they often suffer from noise and ambiguity. In this paper, we propose a neural re-ranking approach, which leverages a deep neural network to learn the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our method, called NeuralQE, first generates a set of expansion terms using a language model, and then re-ranks the candidate terms based on their semantic similarity to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuralQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a relative improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision.
