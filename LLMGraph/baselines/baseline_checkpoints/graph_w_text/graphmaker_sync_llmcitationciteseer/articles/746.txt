Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been increasingly adopted in various applications, but it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can manipulate the learning process. This paper proposes a novel attention-based anomaly detector, 'AADRL', to identify malicious attacks in DRL. Our approach leverages the attention mechanism to selectively focus on the most critical state-action pairs, enabling the detection of subtle anomalies. We evaluate AADRL on a range of DRL scenarios and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting adversarial attacks, outperforming existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness.
