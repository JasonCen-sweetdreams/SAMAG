Few-shot learning has garnered significant attention in recent years, but existing approaches struggle to scale to large graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture, which leverages hierarchical graph representations to efficiently process graphs of varying sizes. HGAT incorporates a novel attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant subgraphs, enabling effective few-shot learning on large graphs. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
