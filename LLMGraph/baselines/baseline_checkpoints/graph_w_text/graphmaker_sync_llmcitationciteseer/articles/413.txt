Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used to store and manage large-scale datasets. Efficient processing of multi-dimensional range queries is critical in various applications. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'DRIQUE', which leverages a combination of bit-sliced indexing and hierarchical clustering to accelerate query processing on DDS. Our experiments on a real-world climate dataset demonstrate that DRIQUE outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time, while maintaining a competitive storage overhead.
