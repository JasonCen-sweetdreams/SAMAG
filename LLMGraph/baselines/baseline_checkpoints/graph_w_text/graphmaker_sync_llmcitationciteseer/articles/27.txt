This paper addresses the problem of distributed task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have varying capabilities and tasks require different resources. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'HetroMAL', which trains agents to learn optimal task assignment policies in a decentralized manner. HetroMAL leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and task dependencies, and uses a hierarchical actor-critic architecture to balance exploration and exploitation. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HetroMAL outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
