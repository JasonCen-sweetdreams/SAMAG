In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, dynamic resource constraints and agent heterogeneity often lead to suboptimal allocations. This paper presents a novel decentralized algorithm, 'DynaCAT', which leverages graph-based modeling and distributed constraint optimization to allocate tasks in real-time. DynaCAT adaptively adjusts to changes in resource availability and agent capabilities, ensuring efficient and flexible task assignments. Experiments on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and resource utilization compared to existing approaches.
