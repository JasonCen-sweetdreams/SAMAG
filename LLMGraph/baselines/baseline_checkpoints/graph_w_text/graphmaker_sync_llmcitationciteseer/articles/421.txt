Multi-tenant database systems are increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing query performance for diverse workloads remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select optimal query plans based on feedback from the database system. Our approach leverages a combination of exploration strategies and a custom reward function to efficiently explore the vast space of possible query plans. Experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset show that our RL-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and throughput.
