Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages contextualized embeddings to better capture the semantic relationships between query terms. Our approach, called ConEx, uses a pre-trained language model to generate contextualized embeddings for query terms, which are then used to expand the original query with relevant terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ConEx significantly outperforms existing query expansion techniques, particularly for queries with ambiguous or rare terms.
