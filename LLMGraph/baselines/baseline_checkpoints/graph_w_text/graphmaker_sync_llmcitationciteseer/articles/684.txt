Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it aims to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn semantic query representations. DeepQE is designed to adapt to varying query lengths and complexities, and can effectively handle out-of-vocabulary terms and synonyms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of both precision and recall.
