Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a complex problem, particularly when agents have different capabilities and preferences. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach, called HeteroAgent, uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal task allocation policy based on agent characteristics, task requirements, and environmental constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that HeteroAgent outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate, agent satisfaction, and system adaptability.
