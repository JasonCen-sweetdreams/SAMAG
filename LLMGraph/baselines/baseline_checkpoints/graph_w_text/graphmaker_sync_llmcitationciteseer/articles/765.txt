Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on superficial term co-occurrences, neglecting deeper semantic relationships. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'SemExpan', which leverages deep semantic embeddings to capture nuanced associations between query terms and relevant documents. By integrating a graph-based neural network with traditional retrieval models, SemExpan significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, especially for short and ambiguous queries. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of SemExpan over state-of-the-art expansion techniques.
