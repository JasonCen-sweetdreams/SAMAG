Graph-structured data has become ubiquitous in various domains, and node classification is a fundamental task in graph analysis. However, existing methods often struggle with multi-label node classification, where each node can belong to multiple classes. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture both local and global patterns in the graph. HGAT consists of a hierarchical encoder that aggregates node features at multiple scales, followed by a multi-label classifier. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of F1-score and AUC-PR, especially on datasets with diverse label distributions.
