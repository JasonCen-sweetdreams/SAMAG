Distributed databases are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but their performance is often bottlenecked by inefficient query execution. This paper presents AWAR, an adaptive workload-aware replication strategy that dynamically adjusts data placement and replica selection to minimize query latency. AWAR leverages machine learning-based workload prediction and proactive rebalancing to ensure that hotspots are effectively mitigated. Our experimental evaluation using the TPC-C benchmark demonstrates that AWAR achieves up to 40% improvement in query throughput and 25% reduction in latency compared to state-of-the-art replication schemes.
