Ad-hoc retrieval faces challenges in capturing the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework, 'NQE-PRF', that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to refine query representations. Our approach combines a neural query encoder with a relevance-based feedback mechanism, allowing the model to adapt to the retrieval scenario. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that NQE-PRF outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
