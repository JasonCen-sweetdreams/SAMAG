Traditional indexing methods struggle to efficiently query high-dimensional data, leading to poor performance in various applications. This paper proposes a learned index structure, 'HDIndex', which leverages deep neural networks to approximate the underlying data distribution. By learning a compact representation of the data, HDIndex enables fast and accurate query execution. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that HDIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving up to 5x improvement in query response time and 3x reduction in storage requirements.
