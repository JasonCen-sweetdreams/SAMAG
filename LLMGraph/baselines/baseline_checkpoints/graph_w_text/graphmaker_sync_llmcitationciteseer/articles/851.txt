Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for businesses to make timely decisions. However, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using column store indexes, which leverages the benefits of both column-store and row-store indexing techniques. We propose a cost-based optimization algorithm that dynamically selects the most efficient indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that our approach achieves an average query performance improvement of 3.5x compared to traditional row-store indexing, while reducing storage costs by 30%.
