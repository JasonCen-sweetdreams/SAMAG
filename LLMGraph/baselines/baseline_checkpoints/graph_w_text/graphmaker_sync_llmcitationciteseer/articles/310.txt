The increasing popularity of multidimensional arrays in various domains demands efficient query optimization techniques for distributed database systems. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ArrayOpt', that leverages a combination of array restructuring, data partitioning, and parallel query execution to minimize query response times. We introduce a cost model that accurately estimates the optimization benefits and demonstrate the effectiveness of ArrayOpt using a real-world climate dataset. Experimental results show that ArrayOpt achieves up to 3x speedup compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques for multidimensional arrays.
