Distributed database systems (DDS) are widely used in modern data centers, but optimizing query performance remains a major challenge. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages learned index structures (LIS) to improve query efficiency in DDS. We propose a framework, 'LIS-Distributed', that integrates LIS with traditional indexing techniques to reduce query latency and improve resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that LIS-Distributed achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods, while maintaining scalability and fault tolerance.
