Query expansion is a crucial step in retrieval-based question answering systems, as it enables the retrieval of relevant passages that may not contain the exact keywords. However, traditional query expansion methods rely on hand-crafted rules or statistical models, which may not capture the nuances of natural language. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. We leverage a pre-trained language model to generate a set of expansion terms that capture the semantic intent of the original query. Our experimental results on the SQuAD dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and answer accuracy compared to traditional methods.
