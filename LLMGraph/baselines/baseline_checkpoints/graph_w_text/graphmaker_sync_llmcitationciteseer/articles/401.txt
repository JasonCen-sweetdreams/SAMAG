Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in Information Retrieval (IR) that aims to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion is a popular technique used to improve retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, dubbed 'QE-DL'. QE-DL leverages a neural network to learn dense query embeddings that capture semantic relationships between query terms and the document collection. Our experiments on several standard IR datasets demonstrate that QE-DL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
