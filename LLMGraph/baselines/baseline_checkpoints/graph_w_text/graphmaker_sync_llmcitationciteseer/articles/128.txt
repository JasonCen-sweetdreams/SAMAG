Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework that leverages context-aware embeddings to better model query semantics. We introduce a two-stage approach, wherein the initial query is first expanded using a graph-based method, and then further refined using a contextualized embedding model. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.
