Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, aiming to mitigate the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepCE', which leverages deep contextualized embeddings to capture semantic relationships between words. We propose a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion and relevance ranking, enabling the model to learn context-aware representations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepCE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
