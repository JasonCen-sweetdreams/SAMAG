Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interfaces often neglect the needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create personalized voice assistants that cater to users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with diverse disabilities, resulting in a set of design principles and guidelines for inclusive voice interaction. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptable dialogue management, multimodal feedback, and customizable accessibility features. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a prototype voice assistant, which significantly improves user satisfaction and task completion rates for users with disabilities.
