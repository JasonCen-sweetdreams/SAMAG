The increasing adoption of blockchain technology has led to the development of distributed database systems that leverage blockchain's immutability and transparency. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the decentralized nature of the data. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'BlockchainAware', that exploits the blockchain's underlying structure to improve query performance. We introduce a cost-based optimization approach that considers factors such as block height, transaction latency, and smart contract overhead. Experimental evaluation on a real-world blockchain-based database system demonstrates that BlockchainAware achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional optimization techniques.
