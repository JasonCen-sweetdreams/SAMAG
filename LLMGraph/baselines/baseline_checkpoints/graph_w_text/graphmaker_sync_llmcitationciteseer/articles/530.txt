Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, efficient query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph queries and the distributed nature of the data. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages graph structural properties and distributed indexing techniques to reduce query latency and improve throughput. We introduce a cost-based optimization approach that adaptively selects the most efficient query plan based on the underlying data distribution and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of throughput.
