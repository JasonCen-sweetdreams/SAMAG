Node classification in attributed graphs is a fundamental task in many real-world applications, such as social network analysis and recommender systems. This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework, 'DeepGAT+', which leverages graph attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant node features and neighbors. We introduce a hierarchical attention architecture that adaptively weighs node attributes and graph structure, leading to improved performance on node classification tasks. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepGAT+ in achieving state-of-the-art performance.
