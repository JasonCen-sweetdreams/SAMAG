This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to model complex agent interactions. Our approach, called 'GNN-TA', utilizes a distributed GNN architecture to learn a task allocation policy that adapts to dynamic agent capabilities and environmental changes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-TA through extensive simulations, showing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized allocation methods.
