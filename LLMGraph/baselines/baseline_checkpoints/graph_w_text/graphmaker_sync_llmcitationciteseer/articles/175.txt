In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem that requires efficient coordination among agents. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. Our approach, called 'AgentQL', uses a multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to learn a decentralized policy that adapts to changing task requirements and agent capabilities. Experiments on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that AgentQL outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and agent utilization. We also analyze the robustness of our approach under varying levels of communication noise and agent failures.
