Traditional query expansion techniques rely on term co-occurrence or synonyms, which may not capture nuanced semantic relationships. This paper proposes a graph-based approach, 'GraphExpan', that leverages word embeddings to model complex relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. We construct a graph where nodes represent words, and edges denote semantic similarity. Our method efficiently prunes the graph using a novel scoring function, resulting in a more accurate and diverse set of expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness to query ambiguity.
