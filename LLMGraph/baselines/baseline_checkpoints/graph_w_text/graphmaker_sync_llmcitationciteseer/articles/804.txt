Optimizing complex queries in distributed relational databases is a challenging task, especially in scenarios with large amounts of data and diverse query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn query optimization strategies. Our method, called QOpt-GNN, represents the database schema and query patterns as graphs and trains a GNN to predict optimal query plans. Experimental results on the TPC-H benchmark demonstrate that QOpt-GNN outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based query optimizers, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x in query execution time.
