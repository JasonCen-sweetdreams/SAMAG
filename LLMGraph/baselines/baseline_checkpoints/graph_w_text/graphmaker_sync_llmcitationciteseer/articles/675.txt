Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of complex queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query representation model, Hierarchical Attention-based Query Encoder (HAQE), which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant aspects of the query. By recursively applying attention at the word, phrase, and sentence levels, HAQE generates enriched query representations that better capture the query intent. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval benchmark demonstrate that HAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query encoding methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
