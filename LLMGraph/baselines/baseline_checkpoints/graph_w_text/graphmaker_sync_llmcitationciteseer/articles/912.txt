Traditional document retrieval methods often struggle to effectively incorporate semantic query expansion, leading to suboptimal ranking performance. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking-based neural model, 'QRex', which integrates query expansion into a unified neural ranking framework. QRex leverages a multi-task learning objective, combining ranking loss with a query expansion reconstruction loss. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that QRex outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving significant improvements in NDCG@10 and MAP metrics.
