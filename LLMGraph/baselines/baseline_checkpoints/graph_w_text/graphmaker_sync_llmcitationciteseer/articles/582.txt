This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for cooperative task allocation in autonomous systems. Our approach, called MARL-TA, leverages deep Q-networks to learn decentralized policies for task assignment and scheduling. We introduce a new reward function that balances individual agent performance with global system efficiency, and demonstrate improved robustness to agent failures and environmental uncertainties. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario show that MARL-TA outperforms baseline methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system utility.
