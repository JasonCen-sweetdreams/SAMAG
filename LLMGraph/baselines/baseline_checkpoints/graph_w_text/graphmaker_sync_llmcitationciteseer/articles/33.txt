In-memory column stores have become increasingly popular for analytical workloads due to their high performance and low latency. However, indexing schemes in these systems often suffer from high memory overhead and poor update performance. This paper introduces Hierarchical Bloom Filters (HBF), a novel indexing technique that leverages the hierarchical structure of Bloom filters to reduce memory consumption and improve query performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HBF on a range of benchmarks, showing up to 30% reduction in memory usage and 25% improvement in query throughput compared to state-of-the-art indexing schemes.
