Coordinating task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in domains with complex interactions and dependencies between tasks. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies. We represent the task allocation problem as a graph, where agents and tasks are nodes, and edges capture their relationships. Our GNN-based model, 'GraphTA', learns to predict the optimal task assignments by aggregating information from neighboring nodes. Experimental results on a range of benchmark problems demonstrate that GraphTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improved task completion rates and reduced coordination costs.
