As the global population ages, designing accessible interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments becomes increasingly important. This paper presents a novel gesture-based interface framework that adapts to individual cognitive abilities and motor skills. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, using a custom-built gesture recognition system. Our results show that the adaptive interface significantly improved gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional static interfaces. We also present a machine learning-based model that predicts cognitive impairment levels based on gesture patterns, enabling early detection and personalized interface adaptations.
