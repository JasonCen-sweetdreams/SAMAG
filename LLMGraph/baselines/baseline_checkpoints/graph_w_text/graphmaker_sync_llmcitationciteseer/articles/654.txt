Coordinating multiple agents to achieve complex tasks is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems. This paper presents a novel approach based on hierarchical task network (HTN) planning, which allows agents to reason about abstract tasks and their decomposition into primitive actions. We introduce a decentralized HTN planning algorithm that enables agents to coordinate their plans while minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results on a logistics domain demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of plan quality and execution time.
