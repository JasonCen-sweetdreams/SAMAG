As data volumes continue to grow, real-time analytics in distributed databases demands efficient query optimization strategies. This paper presents 'ElaOpt', a novel elasticity-aware query optimization framework that dynamically adjusts to changing workload patterns and resource availability. ElaOpt leverages a hybrid cost model that integrates both data and resource heterogeneity, enabling up to 3x improvement in query response times compared to state-of-the-art optimizers. We evaluate ElaOpt on a large-scale distributed database and demonstrate its effectiveness in supporting real-time analytics workloads.
