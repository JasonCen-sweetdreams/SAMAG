The proliferation of IoT devices and real-time data streaming has created a pressing need for efficient indexing and querying of time-series data in distributed databases. This paper introduces 'TSIRIS', a novel indexing framework that leverages a combination of in-memory caching, hierarchical clustering, and distributed query optimization to achieve low-latency query performance for time-series data. Experimental results on a 100-node distributed cluster demonstrate that TSIRIS outperforms state-of-the-art indexing schemes by up to 5x in terms of query latency and 3x in terms of storage efficiency.
