The proliferation of IoT devices and real-time analytics has led to an increased demand for efficient query optimization in data warehouses. This paper presents 'AdaOpt', a novel adaptive query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and statistical models to optimize query plans in real-time. AdaOpt dynamically adjusts to changing data distributions, query patterns, and system workloads, ensuring optimal performance and minimizing latency. Our experiments on a realistic dataset demonstrate that AdaOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
