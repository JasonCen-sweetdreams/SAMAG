In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph attention networks (GATs) to adaptively allocate tasks among agents. Our method, called 'AgentGAT', leverages the structural dependencies between agents and tasks to learn a attention-based allocation policy. Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that AgentGAT outperforms traditional task allocation methods, such as auction-based approaches, in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
