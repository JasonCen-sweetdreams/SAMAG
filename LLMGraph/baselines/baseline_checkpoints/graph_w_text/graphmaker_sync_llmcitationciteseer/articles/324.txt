Knowledge graph embeddings have become a crucial component in various AI applications, but their interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for learning explainable knowledge graph embeddings. HGAT leverages multi-hop relationships to capture both local and global graph structures, while attention mechanisms facilitate the identification of relevant entities and relations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on knowledge graph completion and link prediction tasks, while providing insights into the learned embeddings through attribution analysis.
