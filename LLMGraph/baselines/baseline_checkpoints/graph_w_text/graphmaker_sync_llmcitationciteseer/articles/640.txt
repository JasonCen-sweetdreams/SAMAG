Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their interaction modalities can be inaccessible to individuals with speech or language disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing conversational interfaces that are more inclusive and accommodating of diverse user needs. We propose a set of guidelines for voice assistant designers, focusing on multimodal input support, adaptive difficulty adjustment, and personalized feedback mechanisms. Our user study with 30 participants demonstrates that our approach improves the usability and satisfaction of voice assistants for users with disabilities, while also enhancing overall system efficiency.
