Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAT-GNN) approach for effective anomaly detection in time-series data. HAT-GNN leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between time-series data and captures temporal dependencies using hierarchical attention. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and false positive rates.
