Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can lead to misclassification and security breaches. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect adversarial attacks using Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT). HGAT integrates both local and global feature representations to identify subtle patterns indicative of adversarial attacks. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting various types of attacks, including white-box, black-box, and gray-box attacks. Our results show that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting adversarial attacks, achieving an average detection rate of 95.2%.
