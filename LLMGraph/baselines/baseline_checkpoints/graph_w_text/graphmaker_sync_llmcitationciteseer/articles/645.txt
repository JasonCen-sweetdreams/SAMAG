Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent from short, ambiguous queries. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural topic models to identify latent topics in the query and generate semantically relevant expansion terms. Our method, called NeuroTE, uses a variational autoencoder to learn a compact representation of the query, which is then used to generate expansion terms via a topic-based language model. Experimental results on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroTE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
