As distributed databases continue to scale, multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) has emerged as a crucial technique for ensuring transactional consistency. However, MVCC introduces additional overheads in query processing, particularly in distributed settings. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization framework, 'MVCC-Opt', which leverages statistical models to predict query execution times and dynamically adjusts the MVCC protocol to minimize latency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MVCC-Opt using a comprehensive experimental evaluation on a distributed database benchmark, showing improvements of up to 30% in query throughput and 25% in latency reduction compared to existing MVCC approaches.
