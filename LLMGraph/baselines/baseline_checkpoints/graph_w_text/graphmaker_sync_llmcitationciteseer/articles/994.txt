Data warehousing has become an essential component of business intelligence, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing technique, 'HIQ', that combines the benefits of B+ trees and bitmap indexing. HIQ dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns, data distribution, and storage constraints. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HIQ achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional indexing methods, while reducing storage overhead by 20%. We also provide theoretical bounds on the optimality of HIQ under various query workloads.
