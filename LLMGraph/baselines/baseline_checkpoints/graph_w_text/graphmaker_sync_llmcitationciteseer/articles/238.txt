Real-time analytics on temporal graphs has become increasingly important in various domains, such as social network analysis and IoT data processing. However, existing query optimization techniques are limited by their inability to handle the unique properties of temporal graphs. This paper presents 'ChronoOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages the temporal and structural characteristics of graphs to minimize query latency and improve system scalability. We propose a cost-based optimization algorithm that incorporates graph summarization and temporal indexing to reduce the search space and accelerate query execution. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate ChronoOpt's effectiveness in reducing query latency by up to 5x compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
