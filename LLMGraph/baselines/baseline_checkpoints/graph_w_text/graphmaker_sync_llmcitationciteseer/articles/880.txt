As augmented reality (AR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) become increasingly prevalent, ensuring secure user authentication is crucial. This paper explores the feasibility of gaze-based authentication for AR HMDs, leveraging the device's built-in eye-tracking capabilities. We propose a novel approach, 'GazeAuth', which combines machine learning-based gaze pattern analysis with user behavior modeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GazeAuth achieves a high accuracy of 95.2% in distinguishing legitimate users from impostors, while also providing a seamless and non-intrusive authentication experience.
