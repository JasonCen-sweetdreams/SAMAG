Dense passage retrieval (DPR) models have shown remarkable performance in information retrieval tasks. However, their computationally expensive nature hinders their deployment in real-world applications. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that significantly reduces the computational overhead of DPR models while maintaining their retrieval effectiveness. HQE leverages a hierarchical clustering of the passage representations to prune the search space and selectively expand the query. Experimental results on the MS MARCO and Natural Questions datasets demonstrate that HQE achieves a 3x speedup over traditional DPR models while sacrificing only 2% in retrieval accuracy.
