Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach that leverages dense passage embeddings and hierarchical clustering to prune the search space. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR achieves a 30% increase in retrieval recall at a lower computational cost compared to state-of-the-art sparse retrieval methods. We further analyze the effectiveness of HDR in downstream QA tasks, showing improved answer accuracy and reduced latency.
