This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to improve gesture-based interaction for older adults. We designed a VR system that incorporates bodily gestural cues to facilitate intuitive interaction with virtual objects. Our user study with 30 older adults (ages 65-85) demonstrates a significant reduction in interaction time and error rate compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. Furthermore, our analysis of EEG and behavioral data reveals increased cognitive engagement and reduced cognitive load when using the gesture-based system. Our findings have implications for the design of accessible and inclusive VR interfaces for older adults.
