Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach, dubbed 'DistributedQuery', which reformulates the query optimization problem as a graph partitioning task. By modeling the database as a graph and queries as subgraphs, we develop an efficient algorithm that minimizes communication overhead and reduces query latency. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DistributedQuery outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time.
