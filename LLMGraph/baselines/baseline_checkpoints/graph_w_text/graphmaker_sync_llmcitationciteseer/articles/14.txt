Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial task in natural language processing, enabling businesses to gain insights from customer reviews. However, existing ABSA models struggle to generalize across multiple domains and datasets. This paper proposes a novel graph attention network (GAT) architecture, 'AspectGAT', which leverages the graph structure of review documents to capture complex relationships between aspects, sentiments, and contextual information. Our experiments on a multi-domain review dataset demonstrate that AspectGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ABSA models, achieving improved aspect extraction and sentiment prediction accuracy.
