Decentralized task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems is a challenging problem due to the complexities of task dependencies, agent capabilities, and communication constraints. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'HeteRAL', which learns to optimize task allocation policies in a decentralized manner. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and task relationships, and incorporates a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture to handle task dependencies. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse robotics scenario demonstrate that HeteRAL outperforms traditional optimization methods and achieves near-optimal task allocation efficiency.
