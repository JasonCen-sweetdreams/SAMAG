In multi-agent systems, effective exploration is crucial for efficient task allocation and resource utilization. We propose a novel approach, Graph Attention-based Coordinated Exploration (GACE), which leverages graph attention networks to model agent interactions and coordination. GACE enables agents to share knowledge and adjust their exploration strategies based on the graph structure, leading to improved coverage and reduced redundancy. Our experiments on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that GACE outperforms traditional decentralized exploration methods, achieving higher task completion rates and shorter exploration times.
