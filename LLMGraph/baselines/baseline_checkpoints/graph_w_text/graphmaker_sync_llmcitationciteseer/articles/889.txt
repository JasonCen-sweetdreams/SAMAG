 Gesture recognition systems have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but current approaches often struggle with individual variations in gesture patterns. This paper presents a novel framework that leverages machine learning to create personalized gesture recognition models tailored to each user's unique motor abilities and habits. Our approach combines transfer learning with a Bayesian optimization technique to adapt to individual users' gesture datasets, resulting in significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction. We evaluate our system with a diverse user group, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling accessible interaction for individuals with disabilities.
