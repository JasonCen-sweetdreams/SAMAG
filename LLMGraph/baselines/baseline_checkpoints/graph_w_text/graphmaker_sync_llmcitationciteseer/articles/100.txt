Autonomous vehicles rely on accurate and efficient object detection to ensure safety. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian neural architecture search (NAS) approach, 'AutoDetect', to optimize real-time object detection models for autonomous vehicles. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian optimization framework that incorporates domain knowledge and performance metrics to search for the optimal neural architecture. Experiments on the KITTI dataset show that AutoDetect achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy while reducing inference latency by up to 30% compared to manually designed models.
