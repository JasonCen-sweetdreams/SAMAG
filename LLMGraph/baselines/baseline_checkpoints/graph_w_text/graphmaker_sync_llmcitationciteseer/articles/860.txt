Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges when interacting with web applications. This paper presents EyeTrackingLens, a novel web browser extension that leverages real-time gaze tracking to enable intuitive, hands-free interaction. Our approach utilizes a machine learning-based gaze estimation model, which is fine-tuned on a large dataset of eye movement patterns. We evaluate EyeTrackingLens on a range of web tasks, demonstrating improved accessibility and usability for users with motor impairments. Our results show that EyeTrackingLens reduces interaction time by 35% and error rate by 45% compared to traditional assistive technologies.
