Distributed databases have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a challenging problem due to the complex interactions between query plans and data distribution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a Markov decision process to model the query optimization problem and develop a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers and achieves an average speedup of 2.5x in query execution time.
