Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the precision and recall of search results. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query expansion, leveraging semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed 'GraphExpan', represents the query and its expansion candidates as nodes in a graph, where edge weights are learned from a large corpus of text. We demonstrate that GraphExpan outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, such as Rocchio and relevance feedback, on several benchmark datasets, while requiring fewer computational resources.
