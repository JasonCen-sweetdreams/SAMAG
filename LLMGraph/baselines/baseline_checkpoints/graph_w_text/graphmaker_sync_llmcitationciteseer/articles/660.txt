Multivariate time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper presents a novel graph attention network (GAT) approach, dubbed 'TS-GAT', which leverages the inherent relationships between variables in multivariate time series data. TS-GAT adaptively learns attention weights for each variable, enabling effective feature extraction and anomaly detection. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of TS-GAT over state-of-the-art methods, including traditional statistical approaches and deep learning-based methods.
