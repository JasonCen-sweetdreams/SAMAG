Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the quality of retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using neural semantic embeddings, which capture the nuances of word meanings and relationships. We present a deep learning model that learns to generate expanded queries by projecting user queries into a high-dimensional semantic space. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in precision and recall.
