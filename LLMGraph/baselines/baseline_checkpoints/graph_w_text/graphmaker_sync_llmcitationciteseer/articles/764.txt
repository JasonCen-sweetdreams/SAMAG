In multi-agent systems, trust models play a crucial role in facilitating cooperation and decision-making. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic trust metrics that fail to account for uncertainty in the environment. This paper proposes a novel adaptive trust model, 'ATM-U', which integrates probabilistic reasoning and machine learning techniques to estimate trust values in uncertain environments. We evaluate ATM-U in a simulated environment and demonstrate its ability to adapt to changing conditions, outperforming traditional trust models in terms of cooperation success rates and resilience to manipulative agents.
