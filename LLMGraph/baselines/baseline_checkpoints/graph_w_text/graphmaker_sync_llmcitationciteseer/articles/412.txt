Traditional query expansion techniques often struggle with heterogeneous information networks, where documents exhibit diverse structural and semantic properties. We propose an adaptive query expansion framework, 'AQE-HIN', which leverages graph neural networks to capture complex relationships between documents and queries. AQE-HIN dynamically adjusts the expansion strategy based on the query's semantic context, resulting in improved retrieval performance and reduced computational overhead. Our experiments on a large-scale heterogeneous dataset demonstrate significant gains in precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art methods.
