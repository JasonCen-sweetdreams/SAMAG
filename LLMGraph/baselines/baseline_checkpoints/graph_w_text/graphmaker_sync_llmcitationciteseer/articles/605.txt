Traditional learning-to-rank models for document retrieval often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking approach, 'HierRank', which leverages a two-stage architecture to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. The first stage employs a lightweight neural network to filter out irrelevant documents, while the second stage fine-tunes ranking using a more expressive, but computationally expensive, neural model. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierRank achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational costs by an order of magnitude.
