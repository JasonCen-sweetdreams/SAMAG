In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive solutions. This paper proposes a novel decentralized approach, 'GNN-TA', that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to agents in a distributed manner. We model the agent-task interaction as a graph and use GNNs to learn a representation of the agents' capabilities and task requirements. Our approach enables agents to make local decisions while ensuring global optimality, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in simulations of a disaster response scenario.
