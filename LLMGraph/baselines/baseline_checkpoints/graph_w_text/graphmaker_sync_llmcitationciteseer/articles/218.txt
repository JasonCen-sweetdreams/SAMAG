This paper proposes a novel approach to autonomous task allocation in dynamic multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. We present a decentralized framework, 'RL-Allocator', that enables agents to learn optimal task assignments in real-time, adapting to changing environmental conditions and agent availability. Our approach leverages a multi-agent Q-learning algorithm, which incorporates local and global state information to minimize task completion times and maximize overall system efficiency. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-Allocator in reducing task completion times by up to 30% compared to traditional auction-based allocation methods.
