Short-text datasets, such as those found in social media and messaging platforms, pose significant challenges to traditional information retrieval (IR) systems. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages semantic role labeling and entity recognition to better capture the nuances of short-text queries. Our experiments on a large-scale Twitter dataset demonstrate that CAQE improves the retrieval performance of a state-of-the-art IR system by up to 23% in terms of mean average precision, while reducing query latency by an average of 37%. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the impact of contextual features on query expansion and ranking.
