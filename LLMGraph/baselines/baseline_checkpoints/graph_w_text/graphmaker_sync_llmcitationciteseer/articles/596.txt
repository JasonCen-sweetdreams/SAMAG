Multi-label image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, where an image can be associated with multiple labels. Existing methods often suffer from label dependencies and lack of attention to relevant regions. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention neural network (HAN) that leverages label correlations and spatial attention to improve performance. Our HAN model consists of a label-aware attention module that selectively focuses on relevant labels and a spatial attention module that adapts to the image context. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in achieving state-of-the-art performance and robustness to label noise.
