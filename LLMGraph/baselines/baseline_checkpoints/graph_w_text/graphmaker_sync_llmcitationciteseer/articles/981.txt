This paper proposes a novel hybrid multi-agent system (HMAS) for adaptive traffic signal control. The HMAS integrates decentralized autonomous agents with a centralized optimization framework to optimize traffic signal timings in real-time. We develop a novel communication protocol that enables agents to share local traffic information and coordinate their actions to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. Simulation results on a real-world traffic network demonstrate that the HMAS outperforms traditional fixed-time and decentralized signal control methods, achieving an average reduction of 23.4% in travel times during peak hours.
