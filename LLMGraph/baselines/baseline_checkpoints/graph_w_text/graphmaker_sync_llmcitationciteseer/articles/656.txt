This paper presents a novel gestural interaction design for augmented reality (AR)-based cognitive training systems. We propose a taxonomy of gestures that leverages hand and finger movements to facilitate cognitive exercises, such as attention, memory, and executive function tasks. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that our gestural interface improves engagement, enjoyment, and cognitive performance compared to traditional keyboard-mouse inputs. We also investigate the effects of gesture complexity and feedback on user experience and cognitive outcomes, providing insights for designing effective AR-based cognitive training systems.
