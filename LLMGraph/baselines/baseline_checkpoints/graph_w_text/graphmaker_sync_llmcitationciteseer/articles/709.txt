As autonomous agents become increasingly prevalent in complex systems, understanding their decision-making processes is crucial. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision-making. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant environmental cues and agent interactions, generating interpretable rationales for joint action selection. Experimental results on a real-world traffic management scenario demonstrate improved explainability and decision quality compared to existing reinforcement learning methods.
