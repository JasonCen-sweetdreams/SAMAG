Time series data is ubiquitous in many applications, including finance, healthcare, and climate science. However, clustering time series data remains a challenging task due to its high dimensionality and complex patterns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach that leverages the representational power of deep neural networks. Our method, called HierTS, uses a combination of convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks to extract robust features from time series data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierTS outperforms state-of-the-art clustering algorithms in terms of clustering quality and scalability.
