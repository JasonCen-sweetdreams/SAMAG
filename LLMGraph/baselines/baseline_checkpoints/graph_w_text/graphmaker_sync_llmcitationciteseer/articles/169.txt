Real-time traffic flow optimization is a complex problem that requires coordinating multiple agents with varying goals and constraints. This paper presents a novel decentralized coordination framework, 'SmartFlow', which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize traffic signal control. SmartFlow integrates graph neural networks to model traffic dynamics and attention mechanisms to selectively focus on critical intersections. Our experiments on a realistic traffic simulation platform demonstrate that SmartFlow reduces congestion by 23% and travel times by 17% compared to state-of-the-art traffic management systems.
