Distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) has emerged as a powerful framework for coordinating multi-agent systems. However, existing DCOP approaches often rely on centralized coordination or assume uniform communication topologies. This paper presents a novel, decentralized DCOP algorithm, 'Distributed Optimal Assignment' (DOA), which leverages local search and asynchronous communication to efficiently allocate tasks among agents. We demonstrate DOA's scalability and robustness in simulated domains, including disaster response and supply chain management, and provide theoretical guarantees on its convergence properties.
