This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems, using deep reinforcement learning to optimize the allocation of tasks among agents. We introduce a hierarchical framework that considers both local and global task dependencies, and uses a decentralized decision-making process to allocate tasks to agents. Our approach is evaluated on a variety of scenarios, including disaster response and supply chain management, and shows significant improvements in task completion efficiency and overall system performance compared to traditional allocation methods.
