Node classification in large-scale graphs is a fundamental task in graph-based machine learning. However, existing methods suffer from high computational complexity and memory requirements. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages a hierarchical graph representation to reduce the complexity of node classification. HGAN uses a bottom-up approach to aggregate node features and attention weights, enabling efficient processing of large graphs. We evaluate HGAN on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
