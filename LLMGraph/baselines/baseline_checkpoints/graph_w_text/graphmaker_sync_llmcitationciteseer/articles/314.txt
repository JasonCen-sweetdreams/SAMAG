This paper presents a novel approach to task assignment in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, called Adaptive Task Assignment (ATA), learns to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, availability, and the dynamic environment. ATA uses a decentralized, multi-agent Q-network to optimize task assignments and minimize overall system latency. We evaluate ATA in a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and agent utilization compared to traditional, rule-based assignment methods.
