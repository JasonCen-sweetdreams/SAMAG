Temporal graph databases have become increasingly important for modeling dynamic relationships in various domains. However, querying these databases efficiently remains a significant challenge. We propose a novel indexing technique, 'TempoGraph', which leverages the temporal locality of graph updates to reduce query latency. TempoGraph utilizes a combination of graph partitioning and temporal clustering to facilitate fast retrieval of temporal graph snapshots. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TempoGraph outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in query performance.
