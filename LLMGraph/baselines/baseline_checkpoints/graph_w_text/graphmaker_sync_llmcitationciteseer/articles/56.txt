In today's information-intensive world, efficient retrieval of relevant documents from dynamic collections is crucial. This paper proposes a novel indexed query expansion (IQE) approach that leverages the strengths of both keyword-based and semantic-based retrieval methods. IQE constructs a compact index of document semantics and utilizes a probabilistic query expansion strategy to adapt to changing document collections. Experimental results on the TREC dataset demonstrate that IQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world information retrieval applications.
