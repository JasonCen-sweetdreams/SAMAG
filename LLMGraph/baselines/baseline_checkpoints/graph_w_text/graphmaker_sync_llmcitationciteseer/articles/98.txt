In distributed database systems, join order enumeration significantly impacts query performance. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, leading to suboptimal solutions. We propose 'JoinRL', a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize join order enumeration. JoinRL leverages a graph neural network to represent query graphs and a policy network to generate join orders. Experimental results on various TPC-H benchmarks demonstrate that JoinRL outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving up to 3x improvement in query execution time.
