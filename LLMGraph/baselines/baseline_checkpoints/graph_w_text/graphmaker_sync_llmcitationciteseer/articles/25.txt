Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval, but existing methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper presents a neural query expansion approach, 'NQE', which leverages a transformer-based architecture to learn query-document representations. NQE combines keyword extraction, semantic role labeling, and contextualized embeddings to generate expanded queries that better capture user intent. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to traditional query expansion methods.
