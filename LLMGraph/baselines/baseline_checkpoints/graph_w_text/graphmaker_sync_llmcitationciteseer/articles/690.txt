Multi-agent task allocation is a challenging problem in distributed systems, where agents must coordinate to complete tasks while minimizing communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepMARL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn decentralized task allocation policies. Our algorithm combines graph attention networks with multi-agent Q-learning to efficiently allocate tasks to agents in large-scale systems. Experiments on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that DeepMARL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and communication efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-world applications.
