As distributed relational databases become increasingly prevalent, optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel graph-based approach for query optimization, which leverages the structural properties of query plans to identify efficient execution paths. Our method, 'GraphOpt', constructs a weighted graph representation of the query plan and applies a custom-designed graph clustering algorithm to identify optimal join orders and execution strategies. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
