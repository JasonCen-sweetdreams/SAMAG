Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural phrase embeddings to better model query semantics. Our method, termed NPEx, represents queries as dense vectors in a semantic space, enabling more effective expansion of query terms and phrases. Experiments on the TREC-8 and Robust04 datasets demonstrate that NPEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
