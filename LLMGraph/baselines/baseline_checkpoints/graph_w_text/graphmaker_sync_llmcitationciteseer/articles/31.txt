This study investigates the design of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) tailored to older adults, focusing on cognitive load and user experience. We developed an ECA system incorporating multimodal interaction (speech, gesture, and facial expressions) and evaluated its effectiveness in a user study with 30 older adults. Results show that our ECA design reduces cognitive load and improves user experience compared to traditional text-based interfaces. We also identify key design factors influencing user engagement and perceived trustworthiness, providing valuable insights for the development of ECAs that cater to the needs of older adults.
