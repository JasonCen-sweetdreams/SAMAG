This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents have different capabilities and tasks have varying requirements. We propose a graph neural network (GNN) based framework that learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a graph, and allocates tasks by predicting the optimal assignment of agents to tasks. Our approach leverages the strengths of both model-based and learning-based methods, and is scalable to large systems. Experimental results on a variety of scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving system performance and robustness.
