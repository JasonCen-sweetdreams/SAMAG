Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, particularly for short texts where query terms may not adequately capture user intent. This paper presents a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'QNLP', which leverages semantic role labeling and contextualized word embeddings to expand queries. QNLP incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to adaptively weight query terms and expansion candidates, leading to improved retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several short-text datasets demonstrate significant gains in precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
