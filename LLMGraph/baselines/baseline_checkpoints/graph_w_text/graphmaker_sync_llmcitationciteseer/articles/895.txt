In heterogeneous multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective allocation strategies. We model the agent-task interaction as a graph and use GNNs to learn a latent representation of the agents' capabilities and task requirements. Our approach enables agents to make local decisions while considering global constraints, resulting in improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability to changing system dynamics. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
