The increasing volume of digital data demands efficient indexing techniques for information retrieval systems. This paper presents a novel document indexing approach, 'HierIndex', which leverages hierarchical clustering and sparse matrix representations to reduce index size and query latency. We evaluate HierIndex on a large-scale document collection and demonstrate significant improvements in indexing time, query performance, and storage efficiency compared to existing methods. Our approach is particularly suitable for real-time search applications and distributed information retrieval systems.
