The increasing scale of big data analytics has led to a surge in the use of column-oriented storage systems. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'COLOPT', which leverages the columnar storage layout to reduce query latency and improve system throughput. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that takes into account the column-wise data distribution and storage layout to generate efficient query plans. Experimental results on a real-world big data analytics workload demonstrate that COLOPT outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
