Autonomous agents operating in complex environments require efficient task allocation strategies to achieve their goals. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for distributed task allocation among autonomous agents. Our approach leverages a decentralized actor-critic architecture, where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on local observations and communicates with neighboring agents to achieve global optimality. We evaluate our approach on a simulated warehouse management scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to centralized task allocation methods.
