Voice assistants have the potential to improve the daily lives of older adults, but existing systems often fail to account for age-related changes in cognition, hearing, and speech. This paper presents a participatory design approach to creating accessible voice assistants tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted co-design workshops with 15 older adults and identified key design recommendations, including simplified voice commands, personalized feedback mechanisms, and error correction strategies. We implemented these recommendations in a prototype voice assistant and evaluated its usability with 20 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
