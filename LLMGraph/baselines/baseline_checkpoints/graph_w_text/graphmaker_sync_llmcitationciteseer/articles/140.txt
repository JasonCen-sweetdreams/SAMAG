Nearest neighbor search (NNS) is a fundamental problem in many applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and recommender systems. However, exact NNS algorithms are often computationally expensive, especially for large-scale datasets. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph indexing approach, called 'HGI-ANN', which accelerates approximate NNS queries by exploiting the structural properties of the data graph. Our method leverages a balanced binary tree to partition the data space and a graph-based indexing scheme to prune the search space. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGI-ANN achieves significant speedup over state-of-the-art approximate NNS algorithms while maintaining comparable accuracy.
