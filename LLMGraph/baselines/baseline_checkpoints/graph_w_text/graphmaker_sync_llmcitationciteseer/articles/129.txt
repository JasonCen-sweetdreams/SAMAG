The exponential growth of big data has rendered traditional query optimization techniques ineffective. This paper presents a novel approach to optimize queries for multidimensional big data analytics, focusing on reducing the computational overhead and improving response times. We propose a hierarchical query decomposition framework that leverages statistical correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction to prune unnecessary data access. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate significant performance gains over existing approaches, with an average query execution time reduction of 43.7%.
