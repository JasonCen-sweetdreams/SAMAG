Neural ranking models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but they often rely on simple term frequency-based query representations. This paper proposes an adaptive term weighting approach for query expansion, which selectively incorporates relevant terms from the top-ranked documents. Our method leverages a neural network to predict term importance and dynamically adjusts the weights based on the query context. Experimental results on the TREC 2004 dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the retrieval performance of neural ranking models, outperforming existing query expansion techniques.
