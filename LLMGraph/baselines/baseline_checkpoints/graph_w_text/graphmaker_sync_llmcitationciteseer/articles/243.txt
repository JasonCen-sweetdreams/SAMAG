Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of personalized avatars on user experience in VR environments. We designed and implemented a novel avatar generation system that incorporates user preferences and personality traits. Our user study results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, sense of presence, and overall satisfaction. Furthermore, we identify key factors influencing user preferences and discuss implications for VR system design.
