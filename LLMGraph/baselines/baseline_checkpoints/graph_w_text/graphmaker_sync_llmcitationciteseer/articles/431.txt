Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current VR interfaces often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces that accommodate users with varying levels of visual impairment. We conducted a participatory design study with 15 participants, resulting in the development of four key design principles: audio-centric navigation, tactile feedback, personalized audio cues, and adaptable font sizes. We implemented these principles in a VR game and evaluated its usability with 10 visually impaired participants, demonstrating significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates.
