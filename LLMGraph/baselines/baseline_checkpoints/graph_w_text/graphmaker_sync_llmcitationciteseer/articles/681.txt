E-commerce search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving and ranking relevant products from vast catalogs. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'DNR-EC', which leverages the strengths of both lexical and semantic matchings. We incorporate a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture complex query-product relationships and a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize ranking and retrieval tasks. Experimental results on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that DNR-EC outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of precision, recall, and query latency, making it a promising solution for real-world e-commerce search engines.
