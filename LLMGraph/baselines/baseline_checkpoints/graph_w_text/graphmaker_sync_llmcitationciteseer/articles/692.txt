Neural ranking models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in information retrieval tasks, but they often suffer from limited query representation and shallow relevance feedback. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'PRF-NE', which leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to generate high-quality expansion terms. We introduce a neural pseudo-relevance feedback module that iteratively refines the query representation by incorporating relevance signals from top-ranked documents. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that PRF-NE outperforms existing query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in NDCG@10.
