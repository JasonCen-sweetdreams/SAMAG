As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly pervasive, the need for secure and convenient authentication methods grows. This paper presents a novel eye movement-based authentication approach tailored to AR devices. We leverage the high-resolution eye tracking capabilities of modern AR head-mounted displays to capture unique saccadic patterns, which are then used to verify user identities. Our proposed system, 'EyeGuard', achieves an equal error rate of 2.1% on a dataset of 100 participants, outperforming existing authentication methods in AR scenarios. We also conduct a comprehensive security analysis, demonstrating the robustness of EyeGuard against various spoofing attacks.
