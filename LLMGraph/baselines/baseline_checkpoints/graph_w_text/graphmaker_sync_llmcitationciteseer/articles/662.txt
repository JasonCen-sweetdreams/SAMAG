Query intent identification is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it significantly impacts the relevance and diversity of search results. Existing approaches often rely on fixed ranking models, which can lead to suboptimal performances for queries with diverse intents. This paper proposes a novel adaptive re-ranking framework, 'AdaptIR', which dynamically adjusts the ranking function based on the query context and user behavior. Our approach leverages a graph-based neural network to model the relationships between queries, documents, and user interactions, and incorporates a reinforcement learning mechanism to optimize the ranking policy. Experiments on a large-scale search engine dataset demonstrate that AdaptIR improves both relevance and diversity metrics compared to state-of-the-art methods.
