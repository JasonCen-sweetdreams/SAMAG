Column-oriented NoSQL databases have gained popularity in big data analytics due to their high storage efficiency and query performance. However, supporting multi-dimensional range queries (MDRQs) on these databases remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'CORI', which leverages the columnar storage layout to efficiently process MDRQs. CORI uses a combination of tree-based indexing and bitvector compression to reduce the query response time and storage overhead. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that CORI outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 3x in query performance while maintaining a comparable storage footprint.
