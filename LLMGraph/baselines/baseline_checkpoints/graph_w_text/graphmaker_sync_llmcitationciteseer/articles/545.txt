Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in many domains, but the need for efficient models that can handle high-dimensional data has become increasingly important. This paper proposes a novel deep neural architecture search (NAS) framework, 'TS-NAS', which automatically designs compact and accurate time-series forecasting models. TS-NAS leverages a hierarchical search space and a differentiable NAS algorithm to jointly optimize the model architecture and hyperparameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-NAS on several real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results with significant reductions in model size and inference time.
