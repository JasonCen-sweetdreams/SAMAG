Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between data distribution, query patterns, and system resources. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world graph dataset shows that the RL-based approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
