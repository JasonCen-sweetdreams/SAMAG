Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability for older adults is limited due to cognitive and physical impairments. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction framework for designing inclusive voice assistants. Our approach integrates speech, gesture, and gaze recognition to provide intuitive and adaptive interfaces for older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+ and found significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional voice-only interfaces. Our findings inform the development of accessible and empowered smart home experiences for older adults.
