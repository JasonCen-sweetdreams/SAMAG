Anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) data is a crucial task in various applications, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture for MTS anomaly detection. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model complex relationships between variables and capture hierarchical patterns in MTS data. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency. Our approach is particularly effective in identifying anomalies in high-dimensional MTS data with complex correlations.
