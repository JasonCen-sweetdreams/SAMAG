Entity retrieval in knowledge graphs (KGs) is a crucial task in various applications, including question answering and recommendation systems. However, the performance of KG-based entity retrieval models is often hindered by the limited scope of user queries. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, 'KG-Expand', which leverages the semantics and structure of KGs to generate relevant expansion terms. KG-Expand combines a graph attention mechanism with a mutual information-based ranking function to select the most informative expansion terms. Our experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-Expand significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a relative improvement of up to 23% in terms of mean average precision.
