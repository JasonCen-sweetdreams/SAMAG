The advent of neural information retrieval (NIR) models has led to significant improvements in search engine performance. However, the query expansion component remains a bottleneck, often relying on traditional term-based methods. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion framework, 'NeuroExp', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate semantically rich expansions. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively selects relevant terms and phrases from the query context, resulting in improved retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of NeuroExp over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
