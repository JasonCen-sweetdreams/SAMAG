Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) is a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the varying importance of different modalities. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that adaptively weights and fuses modalities to recognize emotions more accurately and efficiently. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific attention modules, a hierarchical fusion mechanism, and a multimodal emotion recognition module. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recognition accuracy and computational efficiency.
