Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging problem in information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to capture complex semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, called NeuroQE, uses a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query representation and expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving an average increase of 15% in mean average precision.
