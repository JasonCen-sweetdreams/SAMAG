Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to efficiently match queries with relevant documents, particularly in large-scale collections. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document embedding (HDE) approach that captures multi-level semantic relationships between documents. Our method leverages a graph-based neural network to learn dense vector representations of documents, which are then organized into a hierarchical index for fast query-document matching. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Gov2 datasets demonstrate that HDE outperforms state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and query latency.
