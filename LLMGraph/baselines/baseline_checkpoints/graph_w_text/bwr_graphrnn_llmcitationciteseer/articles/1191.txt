Traditional information retrieval systems rely on hand-crafted features and shallow models, leading to suboptimal performance and inefficient querying. This paper introduces a novel approach, Hierarchical Convolutional Neural Networks for Document Ranking (HCNN-DR), which learns rich representations of documents and queries through hierarchical convolutional and pooling operations. Our model adaptively weights and combines multiple ranking signals, enabling efficient and effective retrieval. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and query latency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
