Video anomaly detection is a crucial task in surveillance and monitoring applications. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational costs and limited generalizability. We propose a novel hierarchical contrastive learning framework, 'HiCAD', which learns to detect anomalies in videos by contrasting hierarchical representations of normal and anomalous patterns. HiCAD leverages a multi-resolution feature fusion strategy to capture both local and global contextual information, enabling efficient detection of anomalies at various scales. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiCAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
