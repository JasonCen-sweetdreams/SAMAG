Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular in modern data analytics, but query optimization remains a significant performance bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to changing workload patterns and data distributions. Our method, 'RL-QO', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy from a set of candidate plans. We evaluate RL-QO on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
