Traditional information retrieval systems rely on simple keyword matching, which often fails to capture the semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural network (HNN) architecture for document ranking, which learns to represent queries and documents as dense vectors in a shared semantic space. Our approach leverages both local and global context information to improve the relevance and diversity of retrieved documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HNN-based ranking model outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving significant improvements in terms of NDCG and MAP metrics.
