Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning (ML) to optimize query execution plans in DDS. We develop a ML-based query optimizer, 'QOpt', which learns from historical query patterns and adapts to changing workload characteristics. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that QOpt outperforms traditional rule-based optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
