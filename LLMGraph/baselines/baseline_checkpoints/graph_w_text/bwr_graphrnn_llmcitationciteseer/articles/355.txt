Neural search models have shown promising results in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, but often struggle with vocabulary mismatch between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, NPREF, which leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to adaptively generate expansion terms. NPREF uses a neural reranker to estimate the relevance of top-ranked documents and then applies a modified Rocchio algorithm to extract expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC Deep Learning Track dataset demonstrate that NPREF significantly improves the performance of a state-of-the-art neural search model, outperforming traditional query expansion methods.
