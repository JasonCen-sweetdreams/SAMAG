Distributed column-store databases have become increasingly popular for analytics workloads, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel cost-based optimizer, 'ColOpt', that leverages statistical models and machine learning techniques to efficiently explore the query plan space. We introduce a hierarchical query representation that captures both logical and physical optimization opportunities, and develop a reinforcement learning-based search strategy that adapts to the underlying data distribution and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColOpt outperforms existing state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
