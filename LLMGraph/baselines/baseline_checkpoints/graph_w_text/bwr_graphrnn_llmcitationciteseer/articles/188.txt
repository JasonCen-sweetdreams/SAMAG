Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from multiple sources. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach to query reformulation, dubbed 'DeepQR', which learns to rewrite queries to better match the indexed representations of documents in each source. We leverage a hierarchical neural network architecture to model the semantic relationships between query terms and document representations, and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to traditional query expansion techniques. Experimental results on a large-scale DIR dataset show that DeepQR reduces the average retrieval time by 35% while improving the mean average precision by 12%.
