Voice assistants have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but individuals with disabilities often face barriers in using these systems. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive voice assistants that accommodate diverse abilities and needs. We conduct a mixed-methods study, involving surveys, interviews, and usability testing with 50 participants with disabilities. Our findings inform the development of a set of design guidelines and a proof-of-concept voice assistant, 'AccessibleVoice', which incorporates features such as personalized speech recognition, multimodal input, and real-time transcription. Our evaluation shows that AccessibleVoice significantly improves the user experience and satisfaction of individuals with disabilities.
