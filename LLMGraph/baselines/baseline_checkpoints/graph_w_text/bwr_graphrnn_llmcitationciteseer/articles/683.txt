Virtual reality (VR) has transformed human-computer interaction, but the design of intuitive interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the application of embodied cognition theory to gesture-based interface design in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, comparing three interface conditions: gesture-only, gesture-plus-haptic feedback, and gesture-plus-visual cues. Results show that incorporating haptic feedback significantly enhances user performance and reduces cognitive load. We also identified key design implications, including the importance of gesture naturalness and feedback timing. Our findings have implications for the development of more immersive and usable VR interfaces.
