The exponential growth of biomedical literature has necessitated the development of efficient and effective information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'BioHQE', which leverages domain-specific ontologies and semantic embeddings to disambiguate query terms and expand the search space. Our experiments on the PubMed dataset demonstrate that BioHQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 25% increase in mean average precision and a 30% reduction in query response time.
