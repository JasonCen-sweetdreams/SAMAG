Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way humans interact with digital information. However, the relationship between users' visuospatial abilities and their performance in gesture-based VR interfaces remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study examining the correlation between visuospatial ability and gesture recognition accuracy in a VR environment. Our results show that individuals with higher visuospatial abilities exhibit improved gesture recognition accuracy and reduced cognitive load. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of more inclusive and efficient VR interfaces.
