This paper addresses the problem of task allocation in large-scale multi-agent systems, where agents have diverse capabilities and tasks have varying priorities. We propose an auction-based mechanism, called ' ScalAuction', which enables efficient and scalable task allocation. ScalAuction uses a hierarchical auction framework to reduce communication overhead and incorporates a novel bidding strategy that takes into account agents' capabilities and task priorities. Experimental results show that ScalAuction outperforms existing mechanisms in terms of solution quality, computational efficiency, and robustness to agent failures.
