Voice assistants have the potential to support older adults in daily tasks, but existing systems often fail to accommodate their unique needs and abilities. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing inclusive voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a series of interviews and usability studies to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Based on our findings, we propose a set of conversational strategies that incorporate explicit guidance, error tolerance, and personalized feedback. A prototype system was developed and evaluated with 20 older adults, demonstrating improved task completion rates and user satisfaction.
