Temporal graph databases have become increasingly important for analyzing large-scale network data. However, indexing techniques for efficient query processing remain limited. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, TempHierBloom, which leverages hierarchical Bloom filters to accelerate temporal graph queries. By adaptively partitioning the graph into hierarchical clusters and leveraging Bloom filter properties, TempHierBloom achieves significant improvements in query performance and reduces memory overhead. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in supporting various temporal graph queries.
