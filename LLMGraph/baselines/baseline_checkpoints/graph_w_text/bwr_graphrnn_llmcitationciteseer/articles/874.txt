Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval (IR) due to the complexity of user queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepExpander', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of expansion terms. We model the query expansion process as a Markov decision process and use a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate that DeepExpander significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing the computational overhead.
