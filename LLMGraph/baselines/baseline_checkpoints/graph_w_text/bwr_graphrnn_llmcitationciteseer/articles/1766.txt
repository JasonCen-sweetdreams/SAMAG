Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires reasoning over multiple entities and relations in a knowledge graph. This paper proposes a novel knowledge graph embedding method, 'Hop2Vec', which learns to represent entities and relations in a vector space that captures their semantic and structural properties. Hop2Vec uses a graph attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant entities and relations during the embedding process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Hop2Vec on several MHQA benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results and outperforming existing methods by a significant margin.
