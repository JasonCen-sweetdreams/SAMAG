Personalization in human-computer interaction aims to tailor interfaces to individual users' needs and preferences. While personalization has shown promise in enhancing user engagement, its impact on user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of personalization in adaptive interfaces, focusing on its effects on user satisfaction, efficiency, and cognitive load. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants, using a novel adaptive interface framework that incorporates machine learning-driven personalization. Our results indicate that personalization significantly improves user satisfaction and efficiency, but may also increase cognitive load in certain contexts. We discuss the implications for HCI design and provide recommendations for balancing personalization with user experience.
