In large-scale distributed information retrieval (IR) systems, efficient query processing is crucial for providing timely results to users. This paper presents an adaptive index skipping technique, called 'AISkip', which dynamically adjusts the number of index segments to skip during query execution. AISkip leverages statistical analysis of query patterns and index structures to minimize unnecessary disk I/O and reduce query latency. Our experiments on a real-world web corpus demonstrate that AISkip achieves up to 30% improvement in query response time compared to traditional static index skipping approaches, while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy.
