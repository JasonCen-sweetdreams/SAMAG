Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education by providing immersive and interactive learning experiences. However, the role of embodiment in VR-based learning environments remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the effects of embodiment on user experience and learning outcomes in a VR-based educational platform. We designed and implemented a VR system that allowed users to manipulate virtual objects using gestures and body movements. Our results show that embodiment significantly enhances user engagement, spatial awareness, and cognitive load reduction. We also identify key design recommendations for VR-based learning systems that incorporate embodiment.
