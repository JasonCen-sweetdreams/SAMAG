In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HRL-TA', which enables agents to learn task allocation policies in a decentralized manner. HRL-TA combines a high-level task allocator with low-level agent controllers, allowing agents to adapt to changing task requirements and environmental conditions. We evaluate HRL-TA in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
