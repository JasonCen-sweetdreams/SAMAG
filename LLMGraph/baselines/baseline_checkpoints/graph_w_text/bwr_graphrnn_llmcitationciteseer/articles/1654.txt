Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval that aims to refine the original query to better capture the user's intent. Traditional methods rely on term co-occurrence and frequency-based approaches, which often fail to capture semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based query expansion method, dubbed 'QNLP', which leverages the semantic capabilities of pre-trained language models to generate expanded queries. We evaluate QNLP on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach also shows robustness to query ambiguity and ambiguity, making it a promising solution for real-world IR applications.
