Few-shot image classification remains a challenging task, particularly when labels are scarce. We propose a novel hierarchical meta-learning approach, 'MetaHier', which leverages a nested few-shot learning framework to adapt to new tasks with limited labels. Our method learns to generate task-specific priors and adaptively updates the model parameters using a hierarchical attention mechanism. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that MetaHier outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot classification methods, achieving competitive performance with only a few labeled examples.
