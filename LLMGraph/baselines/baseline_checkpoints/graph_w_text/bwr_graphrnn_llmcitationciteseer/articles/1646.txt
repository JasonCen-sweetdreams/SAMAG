Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query formulations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of expansion terms. Our approach, dubbed 'RL-QE', learns to balance the trade-off between query specificity and coverage by interacting with a simulated search environment. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, improving mean average precision by up to 15%.
