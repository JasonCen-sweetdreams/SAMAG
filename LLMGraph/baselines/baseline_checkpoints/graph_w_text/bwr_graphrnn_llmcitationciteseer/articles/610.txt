Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but its adoption is hindered by user discomfort and fatigue. Haptic feedback has been proposed as a solution, but its effectiveness is highly dependent on the feedback type and intensity. This paper presents a user study evaluating the impact of adaptive haptic feedback on user experience in VR. We propose a novel haptic feedback system that adjusts its intensity and type based on the user's physiological responses, such as heart rate and skin conductance. Our results show that adaptive haptic feedback significantly improves user satisfaction and reduces discomfort, while also enhancing the sense of presence in VR.
