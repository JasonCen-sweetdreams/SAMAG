Ad-hoc retrieval systems struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using hierarchical document embeddings, dubbed 'HDQE'. By leveraging a hierarchical clustering of document representations, HDQE identifies semantically cohesive clusters that are used to generate expanded queries. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HDQE outperforms existing query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
