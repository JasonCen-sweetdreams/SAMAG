Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their usability and accessibility remain concerns, particularly for individuals with disabilities. This study investigates the impact of cognitive load on user experience in voice-based interactions. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, exploring the effects of cognitive load on task performance, user satisfaction, and mental workload. Our results show that personalized voice assistant responses can reduce cognitive load and improve user experience. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants, emphasizing the need for adaptive feedback, clear instructions, and error forgiveness.
