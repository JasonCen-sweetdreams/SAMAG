As Virtual Reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the factors that influence social presence in VR environments is crucial. This study explores the role of embodiment in fostering social presence in VR, examining how the level of bodily representation and agency affects users' sense of co-presence and engagement with virtual agents. Our results show that higher levels of embodiment lead to increased social presence, but also reveal individual differences in response to varying levels of embodiment. The findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to facilitate social interaction and collaboration.
