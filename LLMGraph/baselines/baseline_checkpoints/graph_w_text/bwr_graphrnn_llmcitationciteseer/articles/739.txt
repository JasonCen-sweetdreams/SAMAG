Query optimization is crucial for distributed database systems, where join order enumeration plays a significant role in determining query performance. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'Jasper', which leverages graph neural networks to learn the optimal join order from query patterns and database statistics. Jasper outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of query execution time and scalability, particularly for complex queries involving multiple joins. We evaluate Jasper on a real-world database benchmark and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing query latency.
