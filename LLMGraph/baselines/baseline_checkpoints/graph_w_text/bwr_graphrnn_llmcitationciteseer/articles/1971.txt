Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their performance degrades significantly when interacting with users having non-standard accents. This paper presents a comprehensive study on adapting voice assistants to accented speech, focusing on the Indian English accent. We propose a novel accent adaptation framework, 'AccentAware', which leverages transfer learning and multi-task learning to improve speech recognition accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AccentAware outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a relative improvement of 23.4% in word error rate. We also conduct a user study, revealing that AccentAware's adaptations lead to increased user satisfaction and trust in voice assistants.
