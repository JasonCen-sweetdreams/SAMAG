This paper presents EyeGazeType, a novel keyboard system that leverages machine learning and eye-gaze tracking to improve text entry efficiency. By analyzing users' eye movements, our system predicts the intended character and auto-completes words, reducing the need for manual typing. We evaluate EyeGazeType using a large-scale user study, demonstrating a significant reduction in typing time and error rate compared to traditional keyboard systems. Furthermore, we explore the use of transfer learning to adapt our model to individual users, resulting in improved performance and personalization.
