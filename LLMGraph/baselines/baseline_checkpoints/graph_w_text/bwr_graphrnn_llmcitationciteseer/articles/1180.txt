Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complexity of patent documents and the ambiguity of user queries. This paper proposes an adaptive document re-ranking approach that leverages BERT-based query embeddings to better capture query intent. Our method, called AQE-Rerank, fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model on a large patent dataset to generate dense query embeddings. These embeddings are then used to compute a weighted similarity score between the query and patent documents, which are re-ranked accordingly. Experimental results on the CLEF-IP 2019 dataset demonstrate that AQE-Rerank outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
