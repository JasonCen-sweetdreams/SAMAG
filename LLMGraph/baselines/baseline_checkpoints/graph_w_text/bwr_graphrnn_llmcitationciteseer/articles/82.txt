Graph query optimization is crucial for various applications, including social network analysis and recommendation systems. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on heuristics, which often lead to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to optimize graph queries. We introduce 'GraphLix', a framework that learns to predict the most efficient query execution plan based on historical query patterns and graph topology. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphLix outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2x reduction in memory usage.
