Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using machine learning techniques. We develop a graph neural network-based model that learns to predict the optimal query plan based on the graph structure and query patterns. Our experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
