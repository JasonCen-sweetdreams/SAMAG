This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach for autonomous traffic signal control. We model the traffic signal control problem as a Markov game, where each agent represents a traffic signal and learns to optimize its control policy in a decentralized manner. Our approach, called Decentralized Multi-Agent Q-Network (DMAQN), utilizes a Q-network to approximate the action-value function and a consensus algorithm to share information among agents. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate that DMAQN outperforms traditional centralized control methods and other MARL approaches in terms of reducing congestion and travel time.
