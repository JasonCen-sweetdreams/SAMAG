Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to provide immersive experiences for people with visual impairments, but the lack of visual feedback can hinder their ability to interact with virtual objects. This paper investigates the effectiveness of gestural feedback in VR for individuals with visual impairments. We designed a VR system that uses haptic, auditory, and vibrotactile feedback to convey spatial information and conducted a user study with 20 participants. Our results show that the gestural feedback significantly improves the participants' ability to navigate and interact with virtual objects, and that the combination of haptic and auditory feedback is more effective than vibrotactile feedback alone.
