In multi-robot systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires coordinating heterogeneous agents with varying capabilities and constraints. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn a decentralized task allocation policy. Our method, called 'HeteroAgent', uses a graph neural network to model the interactions between agents and a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework to learn a coordination strategy. Experiments in a simulated warehouse environment demonstrate that HeteroAgent outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion efficiency and robustness to agent failures.
