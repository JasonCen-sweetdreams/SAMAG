Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often pose significant accessibility barriers for this population. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'CognitiveEase', a novel VR interface that incorporates accommodations for cognitive impairments, such as simplified menu systems, audio cues, and gesture-based input. We conducted a user study with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to existing VR interfaces.
