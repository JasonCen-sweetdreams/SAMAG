As data volumes and velocities continue to increase, traditional database systems struggle to keep pace with real-time analytics demands. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'RTQO', designed for distributed databases. RTQO leverages a combination of machine learning-based query prediction, resource-aware query scheduling, and in-memory data caching to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Experimental results on a 50-node distributed database cluster demonstrate that RTQO achieves up to 3x improvement in query response times and 2x increase in system throughput compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
