Real-time data warehousing poses significant challenges in terms of query optimization, particularly in scenarios involving high-volume and high-velocity data streams. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach, 'SmartOpt', which leverages query patterns and historical optimization data to predict optimal query plans. We develop a scalable framework that integrates with popular data warehousing systems, demonstrating improved query performance and reduced latency in experiments with real-world IoT datasets.
