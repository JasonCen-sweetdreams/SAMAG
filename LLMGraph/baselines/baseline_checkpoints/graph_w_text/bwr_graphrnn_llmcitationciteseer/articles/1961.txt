Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly popular in recent years, but their impact on user performance and cognitive load remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of cognitive load on user performance in gesture-based interfaces. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built gesture recognition system and a cognitive load manipulation task. Our results show that high cognitive load significantly impairs user performance, leading to increased error rates and decreased gesture recognition accuracy. We also found that users' cognitive load levels can be accurately predicted using machine learning models trained on physiological and behavioral data. Our findings have important implications for the design of gesture-based interfaces and highlight the need for cognitive load-aware interaction techniques.
