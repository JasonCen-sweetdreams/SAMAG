Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense passage embedding (HDPE) approach, which leverages a two-level hierarchical framework to represent passages at both sentence and document levels. Our experiments on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that HDPE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art dense passage retrieval methods, achieving a 15% increase in top-1 passage retrieval accuracy while reducing indexing time by 30%. We also show that HDPE is robust to varying passage lengths and can be easily integrated with existing ODQA pipelines.
