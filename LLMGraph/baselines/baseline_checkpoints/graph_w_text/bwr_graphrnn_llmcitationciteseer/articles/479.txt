Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed relational databases. Our approach, called 'RL-QEP', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query execution plan based on the database's performance metrics. We evaluate RL-QEP using the TPC-DS benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
