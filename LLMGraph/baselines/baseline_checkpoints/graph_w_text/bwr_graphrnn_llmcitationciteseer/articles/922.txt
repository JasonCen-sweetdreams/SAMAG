Existing information retrieval systems rely on predefined query intent categorizations, which can be limiting and inflexible. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach to discover query intent patterns using deep clustering on ad-hoc retrieval datasets. Our method, dubbed 'IntentCluster', leverages a combination of word embeddings and clustering algorithms to automatically identify underlying query intent categories. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that IntentCluster outperforms state-of-the-art intent detection methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
