Cold start problem is a long-standing challenge in recommendation systems, where user-item interactions are scarce. This paper proposes a hybrid retrieval model, 'HybCR', that combines the strengths of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering. HybCR leverages a graph neural network to learn user and item representations from their attributes, and then employs a dense retrieval mechanism to generate recommendations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HybCR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cold start scenarios, achieving an average improvement of 23.1% in recall and 17.4% in normalized discounted cumulative gain.
