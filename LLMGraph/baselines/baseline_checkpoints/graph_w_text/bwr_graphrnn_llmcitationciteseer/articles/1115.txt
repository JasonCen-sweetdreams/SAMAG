We present a novel approach to distributed task allocation using multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our framework, 'MARL-TA', enables agents to learn cooperative strategies for task assignment in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce a decentralized reward function that incorporates both local and global performance metrics, promoting efficient task allocation while respecting agent capabilities and resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MARL-TA outperforms traditional centralized optimization methods in large-scale task allocation scenarios, achieving significant improvements in overall system throughput and robustness.
