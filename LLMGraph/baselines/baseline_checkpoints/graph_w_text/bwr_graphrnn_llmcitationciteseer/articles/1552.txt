As document-oriented databases become increasingly popular, optimizing query performance is crucial for scalable data processing. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'DocOQ', designed specifically for distributed document-oriented databases. DocOQ leverages a combination of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to identify optimal query plans, minimizing latency and resource utilization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DocOQ through extensive experiments on a real-world dataset, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to existing optimization techniques.
