Conventional information retrieval systems rely on exact keyword matching, neglecting semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepHash-QE', which integrates deep semantic hashing and query expansion to improve document retrieval efficiency. Our method learns compact binary representations of documents and queries, enabling fast similarity search and reducing the need for exact matching. Experimental results on the TREC-COVID dataset demonstrate that DeepHash-QE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.
