Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of distributed query optimization. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed database systems. Our approach, called 'RL-QEP', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query execution plan based on the database system's workload and performance metrics. Experimental results show that RL-QEP outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
