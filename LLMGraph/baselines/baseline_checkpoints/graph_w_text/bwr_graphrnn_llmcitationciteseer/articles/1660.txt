The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of sensor data, making real-time aggregation queries a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'RTAgg', which leverages the temporal and spatial correlations inherent in IoT data to accelerate query processing. RTAgg utilizes a hierarchical indexing structure that adaptively partitions the data into hot and cold regions, enabling efficient aggregation and filtering. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrates that RTAgg outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query response time and storage efficiency.
