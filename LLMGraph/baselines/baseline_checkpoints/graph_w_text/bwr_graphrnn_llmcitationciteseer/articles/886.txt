Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but existing methods suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture that leverages multi-scale graph representations to improve node classification efficiency. HGAN adaptively selects relevant nodes and features at each hierarchy level, reducing the computational cost while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate HGAN's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and running time.
