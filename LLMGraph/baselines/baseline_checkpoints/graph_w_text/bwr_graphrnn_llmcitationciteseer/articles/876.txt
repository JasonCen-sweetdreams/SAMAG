Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process of recommendation models. This paper proposes a novel heterogeneous graph attention network (HGAT) for ERS, which integrates user, item, and knowledge graph data to generate personalized explanations. We design a graph attention mechanism that captures complex relationships between users, items, and knowledge entities, and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of both recommendation performance and explanation quality.
