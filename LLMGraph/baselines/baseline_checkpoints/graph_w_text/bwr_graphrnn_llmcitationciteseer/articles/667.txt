Traditional document retrieval systems often rely on bag-of-words representations, ignoring the rich contextual relationships between query terms and document contents. This paper proposes a novel graph-based neural re-ranking model, 'GraphRerank', which leverages the graph structure of query-document interactions to improve retrieval efficiency. By adaptively weighting term importance and capturing semantic dependencies, GraphRerank achieves significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and reduces computational overhead. Experimental results on the TREC 2020 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming state-of-the-art neural re-ranking models.
