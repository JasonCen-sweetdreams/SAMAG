Ad-hoc retrieval continues to be a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural semantic role labeling (SRL) to better capture the contextual relationships between query terms. Our method, dubbed NeuroQL, uses a pre-trained language model to generate semantic role embeddings, which are then incorporated into a probabilistic relevance feedback framework. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that NeuroQL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision.
