Augmented reality (AR) technology has been increasingly used in various applications, but its user interface remains a significant bottleneck. This paper explores the potential of gaze-based interaction for AR, focusing on user experience and performance. We designed and implemented a gaze-based AR system and conducted a user study with 24 participants. Our results show that gaze-based interaction can significantly reduce task completion time and improve user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based methods. We also identify several design implications and future research directions for gaze-based AR interfaces.
