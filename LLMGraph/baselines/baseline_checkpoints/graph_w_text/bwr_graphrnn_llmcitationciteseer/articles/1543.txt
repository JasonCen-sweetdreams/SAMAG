Distributed database systems (DDS) are crucial for supporting large-scale applications, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize query execution plans in DDS. We design a DRL agent that learns to select the optimal plan based on query characteristics, system workload, and resource availability. Our experiments on a real-world DDS dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques, achieving up to 30% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in resource utilization.
