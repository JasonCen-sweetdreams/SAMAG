We present a novel graph attention network (GAT) framework, HeteroGAT, designed to tackle the complex task allocation problem in multi-agent systems. By explicitly modeling heterogeneous agent and task relationships, HeteroGAT learns to allocate tasks efficiently and adapt to dynamic environmental changes. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global dependencies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in simulated and real-world robotic scenarios.
