The proliferation of IoT devices and real-time analytics applications has created a pressing need for efficient indexing and querying of time-series data in distributed database systems. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'TS-Tree', which leverages a combination of spatial and temporal locality to reduce query latency and improve data freshness. We evaluate TS-Tree on a large-scale distributed database system and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing indexing methods, achieving up to 3x faster query times and 2x better data freshness.
