Autonomous vehicles operating in dynamic environments require efficient task planning to adapt to changing circumstances. This paper presents a novel hierarchical task network planning framework, 'HTNP-AV', which integrates symbolic and geometric planning to generate feasible and optimal plans. HTNP-AV utilizes a layered architecture to reason about tasks, motions, and trajectories, allowing it to handle complex scenarios with multiple goals and constraints. Experimental results in a simulated urban environment demonstrate the effectiveness of HTNP-AV in reducing planning time and improving vehicle safety compared to traditional planning approaches.
