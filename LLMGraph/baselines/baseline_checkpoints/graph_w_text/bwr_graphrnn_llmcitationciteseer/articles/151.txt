Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must adapt to dynamic environments and allocate tasks efficiently. This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework, 'SOATA', which leverages self-organizing agents to optimize task allocation in real-time. SOATA integrates a distributed auction-based mechanism with a self-organizing neural network that learns to predict task requirements and agent capabilities. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that SOATA outperforms existing decentralized task allocation approaches in terms of task completion rate, latency, and robustness to agent failures.
