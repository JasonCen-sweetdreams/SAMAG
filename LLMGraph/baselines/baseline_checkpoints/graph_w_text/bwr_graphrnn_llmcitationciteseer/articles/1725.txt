The exponential growth of digital documents has necessitated the development of efficient hierarchical clustering algorithms for document retrieval. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'HierDoc', which leverages the properties of graph theory to cluster documents in a hierarchical manner. By representing documents as nodes in a graph and edges as similarity measures, we develop a divisive clustering algorithm that recursively partitions the graph into densely connected subgraphs, enabling efficient retrieval of relevant documents. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HierDoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering quality and retrieval efficiency.
