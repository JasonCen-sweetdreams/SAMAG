Distributed databases have become increasingly prevalent in modern data management, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents AIDA, an adaptive indexing framework that dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution. AIDA leverages a hybrid indexing approach that combines traditional B-tree indexing with a novel, compact indexing scheme tailored for distributed environments. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that AIDA achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques, while maintaining a low storage overhead.
