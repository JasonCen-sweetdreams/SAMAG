Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has become a widely adopted paradigm for open-domain question answering. However, DPR systems often struggle to retrieve relevant passages when the query does not contain sufficient keywords. We propose a novel query-driven document expansion approach, 'QDE', which generates synthetic passages that capture the semantic context of the query. Our experiments demonstrate that QDE significantly improves the retrieval performance of a state-of-the-art DPR system, particularly for queries with limited contextual information. We also show that QDE can be seamlessly integrated with existing DPR architectures, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.
