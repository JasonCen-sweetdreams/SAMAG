Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various node classification tasks. However, existing methods often overlook the hierarchical structure present in many real-world graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to capture hierarchical dependencies between nodes. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a bottom-up node representation learning phase, and (2) a top-down attention-based node classification phase. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms existing GNN models, especially on graphs with complex hierarchical structures.
