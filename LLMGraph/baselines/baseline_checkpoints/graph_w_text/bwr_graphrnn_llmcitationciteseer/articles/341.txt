Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it can significantly impact retrieval accuracy. This paper proposes a neural semantic embedding-based query expansion approach, dubbed 'NeuroQE', which leverages the power of deep learning to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. We employ a graph-based neural network to learn dense vector representations of words and phrases, which are then used to compute semantic similarity scores for expansion term selection. Experimental results on several benchmark IR datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness.
