Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query representations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to adaptively select and weight expansion terms. Our approach uses a double-deep Q-network to learn a policy that balances the trade-off between query drift and relevance improvement. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
