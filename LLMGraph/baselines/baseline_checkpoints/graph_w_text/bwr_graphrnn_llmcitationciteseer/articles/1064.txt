As virtual assistants become increasingly pervasive, it is essential to understand the factors influencing user trust. This study investigates the role of embodiment in shaping trust in virtual assistants. We conducted a controlled experiment with 120 participants, comparing a humanoid robot, achatbot, and a voice-only assistant. Results show that users perceive the humanoid robot as more trustworthy and likable, while the chatbot is seen as more efficient. However, we found no significant difference in task performance across conditions. Our findings have implications for the design of virtual assistants and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of embodiment in HCI.
