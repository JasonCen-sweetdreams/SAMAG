As big data analytics continues to grow in scale and complexity, query optimization becomes a critical bottleneck. This paper introduces GraphIndex, a novel graph-based indexing technique that accelerates query execution by up to 5x. By modeling data correlations as a graph, GraphIndex identifies optimal query plans that minimize I/O overhead and leverage parallel processing. We evaluate GraphIndex on a range of real-world datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing methods.
