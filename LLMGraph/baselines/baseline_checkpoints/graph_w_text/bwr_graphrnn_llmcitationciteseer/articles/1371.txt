Touch-based interfaces are ubiquitous in modern devices, but users with motor impairments often struggle to interact with them effectively. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'AdapTouch', a novel interface framework that dynamically adapts to the abilities and needs of users with motor impairments. We employ a machine learning-based approach to analyze the user's touch behavior and adjust the interface parameters, such as button size and sensitivity, in real-time. Our user study involving 20 participants with motor impairments demonstrates significant improvements in interaction accuracy and speed, as well as enhanced user satisfaction, when using AdapTouch compared to traditional interfaces.
