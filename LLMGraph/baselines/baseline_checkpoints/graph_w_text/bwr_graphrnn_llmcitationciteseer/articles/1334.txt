Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to improve the retrieval effectiveness by reformulating the original query. This paper proposes a neural re-ranker based query expansion approach, which leverages the semantic relationships between the query terms and the documents to generate effective expansion terms. Our model, named NeuralExpansion, employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture the contextual information and a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the expansion process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuralExpansion outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
