Query expansion is a crucial step in improving the effectiveness of ad-hoc retrieval systems. This paper presents a novel neural embedding-based approach to term selection, which leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. Our model, called NeuroTE, learns to represent query terms and documents as dense vectors, enabling the identification of informative expansion terms that are semantically close to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroTE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance.
