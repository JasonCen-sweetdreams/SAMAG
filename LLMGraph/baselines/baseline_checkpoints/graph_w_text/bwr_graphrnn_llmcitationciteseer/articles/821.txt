Ad-hoc search systems struggle to effectively capture the nuanced semantics of user queries, leading to subpar retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel neural retrieval framework, 'QADE', which leverages query-aware document embeddings to better align query-document similarities. We introduce a dual-encoder architecture that jointly learns query and document representations, incorporating a novel attention mechanism to focus on relevant query terms. Experiments on the TREC-8 ad-hoc search benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and showcasing the potential of QADE for real-world search applications.
