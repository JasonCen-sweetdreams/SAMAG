Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has witnessed significant progress with the advent of dense passage retrieval (DPR) models. However, existing approaches suffer from high computational costs and memory requirements, limiting their scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense indexing (HDI) framework that accelerates passage retrieval by 3.5x while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art DPR models. We introduce a hierarchical clustering strategy that groups semantically similar passages, enabling efficient indexing and querying. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of HDI in reducing inference latency and improving overall ODQA performance.
