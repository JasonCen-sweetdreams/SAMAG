 Gesture recognition systems are increasingly popular in human-computer interaction, but their performance often degrades for individuals with motor impairments. This paper presents a novel adaptive gesture recognition framework, 'AdapGesture', which leverages machine learning and sensor fusion to accommodate varying levels of motor ability. AdapGesture utilizes a personalized calibration phase to learn user-specific gesture patterns and adaptively adjusts its recognition thresholds based on user performance. Our user study involving 20 participants with motor impairments demonstrates significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing gesture recognition systems.
