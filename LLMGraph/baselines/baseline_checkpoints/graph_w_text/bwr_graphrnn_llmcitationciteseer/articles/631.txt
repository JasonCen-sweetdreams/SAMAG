Virtual reality (VR) systems often rely on visual and auditory cues to provide users with a sense of immersion. However, the lack of haptic feedback can lead to a disconnect between the user's actions and the virtual environment. This paper investigates the impact of vibrotactile feedback on user experience in VR. We designed a study to compare user performance and satisfaction in a VR task with and without vibrotactile feedback. Our results show that vibrotactile feedback significantly improves user performance and reduces user frustration, particularly in tasks requiring fine motor control. We also present a novel framework for integrating vibrotactile feedback into VR systems, which can be adapted to various applications.
