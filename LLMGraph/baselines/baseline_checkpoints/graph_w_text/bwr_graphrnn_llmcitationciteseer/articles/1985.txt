Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to improve the retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach for query expansion, which leverages semantic term embeddings to capture the nuanced relationships between terms. Our approach, dubbed 'TermEmb', uses a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn dense vector representations of terms that are aware of their context and semantic meaning. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that TermEmb significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving an average improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG).
