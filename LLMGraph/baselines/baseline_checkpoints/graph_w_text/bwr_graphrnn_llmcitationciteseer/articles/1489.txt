Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short and ambiguous queries. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuQE', that leverages deep neural ranking models to estimate the relevance of expansion terms. We propose a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes the ranking loss and a regularization term encouraging diversity in the expanded query. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 benchmarks demonstrate that NeuQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% relative improvement in mean average precision.
