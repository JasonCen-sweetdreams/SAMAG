Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained popularity, but existing methods struggle to capture complex relationships between users, items, and contextual factors. We propose a novel context-aware knowledge graph embedding (CAKGE) approach that integrates multi-relational knowledge graphs with contextual information. CAKGE learns entity and relation embeddings that incorporate contextual dependencies, enabling the generation of interpretable explanations for recommendations. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that CAKGE outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
