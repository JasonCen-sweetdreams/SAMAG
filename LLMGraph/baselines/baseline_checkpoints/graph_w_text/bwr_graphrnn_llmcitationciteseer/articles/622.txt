Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in data integration, but it becomes increasingly challenging when dealing with large-scale distributed databases. This paper presents a novel approach to entity disambiguation using graph-based neural networks, which can efficiently handle massive datasets and scale horizontally. Our method, dubbed 'GraphDis', leverages the power of graph convolutional networks to model complex relationships between entities and their contextual information. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphDis outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, while being capable of handling distributed data sources.
