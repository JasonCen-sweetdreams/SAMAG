The growing popularity of Resource Description Framework (RDF) has led to an increased need for efficient query processing techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of various indexing techniques for scalable RDF query processing. We implement and compare four indexing approaches, namely, B-Tree, Hash, Trie, and Bitmapped indexing, using a real-world RDF dataset. Our experimental results show that the choice of indexing technique significantly impacts query performance, with Bitmapped indexing outperforming other approaches by up to 30% in certain scenarios. We also discuss the trade-offs between indexing techniques and provide guidelines for selecting the most suitable approach based on query patterns and dataset characteristics.
