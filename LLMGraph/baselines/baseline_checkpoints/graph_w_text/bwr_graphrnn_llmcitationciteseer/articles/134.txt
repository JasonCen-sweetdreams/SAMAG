The increasing complexity of modern search systems demands more efficient and adaptive learning-to-rank (LTR) models. This paper proposes ElasticRank, a novel LTR framework that leverages online learning and transfer learning to adapt to dynamic search environments. ElasticRank utilizes a hierarchical neural network architecture to model complex query-document relationships and incorporates a meta-learning component to rapidly adapt to changing user behavior and query distributions. Experimental results on a large-scale search engine dataset demonstrate that ElasticRank significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LTR methods in terms of ranking quality, computational efficiency, and adaptability to environmental changes.
