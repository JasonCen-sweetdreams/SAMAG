Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when dealing with novel classes. This paper proposes a new deep metric learning approach, 'HierProto', which leverages hierarchical prototypes to improve few-shot classification performance. Our method learns to represent each class as a hierarchical structure of prototypes, capturing varying levels of abstraction and semantic similarity. Experimental results on popular benchmarks, including mini-ImageNet and Fewshot-CIFAR100, demonstrate that HierProto outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains in accuracy and robustness.
