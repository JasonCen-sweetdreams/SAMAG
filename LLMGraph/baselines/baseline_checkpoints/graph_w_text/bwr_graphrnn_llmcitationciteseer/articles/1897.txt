Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing large-scale graph data, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans for distributed graph databases by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
