Main-memory databases have become increasingly popular in recent years, but existing indexing structures are often optimized for disk-based storage, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes QR-Tree, a novel indexing structure designed specifically for main-memory databases. QR-Tree leverages the properties of modern CPU architectures to minimize memory access patterns and reduce query latency. Our experimental evaluation on a range of real-world workloads demonstrates that QR-Tree outperforms state-of-the-art indexing structures by up to 3x in terms of query throughput and response time.
