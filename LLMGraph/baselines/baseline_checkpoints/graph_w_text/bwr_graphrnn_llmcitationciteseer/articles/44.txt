This paper explores the application of embodied cognition theory to gesture-based interaction in virtual reality (VR). We designed a VR environment that simulates everyday tasks, such as cooking and puzzle-solving, and investigated how users' gestures influence their problem-solving strategies and cognitive load. Our results show that gestures can significantly impact cognitive processing, with users exhibiting improved performance and reduced mental workload when allowed to use gestures. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more intuitive and effective VR interfaces, and highlight the potential of embodied cognition principles to inform future HCI research.
