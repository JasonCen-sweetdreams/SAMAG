Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face scalability challenges as they process increasingly large query volumes. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing framework, 'AIx', which dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and document distributions. Our approach leverages machine learning models to predict query frequencies and optimize index creation, resulting in improved query performance and reduced storage overhead. Experiments on a large-scale DIR testbed demonstrate AIx's ability to achieve up to 30% query latency reduction and 25% index size reduction compared to traditional indexing methods.
