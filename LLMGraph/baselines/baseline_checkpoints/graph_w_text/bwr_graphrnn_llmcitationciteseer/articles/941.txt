The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors has led to an explosion in time-series data, necessitating efficient storage and querying mechanisms. This paper presents a novel secondary indexing approach, 'TSIndex', tailored for column-oriented NoSQL databases. TSIndex exploits the inherent properties of time-series data to reduce storage overhead and improve query performance. Our experiments on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that TSIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3.5x in query latency and 2x in storage efficiency, while maintaining data freshness guarantees.
