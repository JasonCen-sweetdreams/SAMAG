This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effect of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) on user experience in virtual reality (VR) environments. We designed and implemented a VR-based platform that integrates ECAs with varying levels of anthropomorphism and explored their influence on user engagement, trust, and cognitive load. Our results show that ECAs with moderate anthropomorphism lead to improved user experience, while highly realistic or cartoonish agents negatively impact user interaction. We also identify significant correlations between ECA design and user personality traits, highlighting the need for personalized ECA adaptations in VR applications.
