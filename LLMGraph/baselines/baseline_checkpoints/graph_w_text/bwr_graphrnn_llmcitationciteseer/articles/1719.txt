The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has created a need for efficient resource allocation mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel autonomous agent-based negotiation framework for multi-resource allocation in IoT networks. We design a decentralized, multi-issue negotiation protocol that enables agents to negotiate over multiple resources simultaneously, while considering the dynamic constraints and preferences of each agent. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of allocation efficiency, fairness, and robustness to changes in the network.
