Entity disambiguation in multilingual queries remains a challenging task in information retrieval. This paper proposes a hybrid retrieval model, 'HybridED', which integrates semantic embeddings with graph-based entity disambiguation. HybridED leverages pre-trained language models to capture contextualized semantic relationships between entities and queries, while also exploiting graph structure to resolve ambiguity. Experimental results on a large-scale multilingual dataset demonstrate significant improvement in entity disambiguation accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art models by up to 12% in F1-score.
