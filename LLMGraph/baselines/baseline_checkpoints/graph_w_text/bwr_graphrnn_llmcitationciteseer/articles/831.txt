As the global population ages, it is essential to design voice-based interfaces that are accessible and usable by older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an intelligent conversational agent that accommodates the unique needs of this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with caregivers and older adults to identify key design requirements, including simplification of dialogue flows, personalized feedback mechanisms, and error tolerance. Our prototype, 'EasyTalk', was evaluated in a usability study, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
