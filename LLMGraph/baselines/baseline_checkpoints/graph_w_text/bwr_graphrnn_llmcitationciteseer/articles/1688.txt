Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image segmentation tasks, but their computational complexity and memory requirements hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. This paper proposes a novel neural architecture search (NAS) method, 'SegNAS', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the search process for efficient image segmentation models. SegNAS explores a vast search space of potential architectures and identifies a family of models that achieve competitive performance to state-of-the-art models while requiring significantly fewer parameters and computations. We evaluate SegNAS on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in finding efficient and accurate image segmentation models.
