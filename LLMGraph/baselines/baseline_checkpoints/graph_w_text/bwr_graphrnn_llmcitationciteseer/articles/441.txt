Column-store databases have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to efficiently store and query large amounts of data. However, optimizing subquery processing in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize subquery processing in column-store databases. We present a predictive model that learns from historical query patterns and optimizes subquery execution plans to reduce query latency and improve system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional optimization techniques.
