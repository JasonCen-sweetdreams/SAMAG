Ad-hoc retrieval often relies on query expansion to improve retrieval performance. However, traditional methods suffer from either limited vocabulary coverage or increased computational complexity. This paper proposes a neural query expansion approach, 'NQE', which leverages document embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain. We also show that NQE is computationally efficient and can be easily integrated into existing retrieval systems.
