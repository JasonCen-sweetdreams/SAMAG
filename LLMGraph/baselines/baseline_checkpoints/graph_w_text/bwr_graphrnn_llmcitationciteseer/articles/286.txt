Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory co-design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with 15 older adults, resulting in 25 design recommendations that prioritize simplicity, flexibility, and multimodal interaction. We implemented these recommendations in a prototype voice assistant and evaluated its usability with 20 older adults, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion and user satisfaction. Our findings contribute to the development of more accessible and user-centered voice assistants for older adults.
