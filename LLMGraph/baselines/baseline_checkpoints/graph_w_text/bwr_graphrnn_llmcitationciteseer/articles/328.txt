Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) systems require efficient query optimization to ensure low latency and high throughput. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We propose a DRL framework that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the RTDW system and receiving rewards based on query performance. Our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by adapting to changing workload patterns and exploiting opportunities for parallelism. Experimental results on a realistic RTDW benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and system throughput.
