Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural word embeddings to model semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, QE-NWE, uses a deep neural network to learn a dense representation of the query context, which is then used to generate a set of expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QE-NWE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
