In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient coalition formation. This paper presents a novel distributed algorithm, 'DCFA', which enables agents to form coalitions and allocate tasks in a decentralized manner. DCFA leverages graph neural networks to learn agent embeddings and a distributed constraint optimization framework to find optimal coalitions. We evaluate DCFA on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate improved task allocation efficiency and robustness compared to centralized approaches.
