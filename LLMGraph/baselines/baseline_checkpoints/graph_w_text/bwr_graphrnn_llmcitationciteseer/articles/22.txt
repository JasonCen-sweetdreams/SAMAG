The growing adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has raised concerns about their vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect such attacks using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). We model the AV's sensor data as a graph and leverage GCNs to learn a robust representation of the vehicle's state. Our approach can detect subtle perturbations in the sensor data, indicative of an adversarial attack. Experimental results on a large-scale AV dataset show that our method outperforms traditional anomaly detection techniques, achieving a detection accuracy of 95.2% with a false positive rate of 2.1%
