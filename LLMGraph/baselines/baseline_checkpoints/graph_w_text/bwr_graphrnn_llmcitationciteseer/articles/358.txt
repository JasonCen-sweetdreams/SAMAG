In multi-agent systems, efficient resource allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach that combines deep reinforcement learning with graph neural networks to coordinate agents in adaptive resource allocation tasks. Our method, 'DRL-GNN', learns to optimize resource allocation policies by modeling the complex interactions between agents and their environment. Experimental results in simulated smart grid scenarios demonstrate that DRL-GNN outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of resource utilization and adaptability to changing environment conditions.
