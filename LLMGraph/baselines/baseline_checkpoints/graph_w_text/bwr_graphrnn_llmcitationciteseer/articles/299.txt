Coordinating multiple agents in complex systems is challenging due to the exponential growth of possible interactions. This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model agent interactions at multiple scales. HGAT enables efficient coordination of agents by learning hierarchical representations of their relationships and adapting to changing environmental conditions. Our experiments on a simulated urban traffic control scenario demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of coordination efficiency and adaptability.
