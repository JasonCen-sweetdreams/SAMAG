The proliferation of big data and the increasing complexity of queries have made query optimization a critical component of distributed database systems. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GPU-Opt', that leverages the parallel processing capabilities of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate query execution. We propose a GPU-aware cost model that estimates the execution time of queries on both CPU and GPU architectures, enabling the optimizer to make informed decisions about query execution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GPU-Opt achieves an average speedup of 3.2x compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
