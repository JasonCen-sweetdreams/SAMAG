This paper presents a novel approach to gesture recognition systems that adapt to the motor abilities of individuals with motor impairments. Our system, 'AdaptiveGest', uses a machine learning-based framework to learn the characteristic movement patterns of each user and adjust the recognition threshold accordingly. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with varying levels of motor impairment and found that AdaptiveGest outperformed existing gesture recognition systems in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. Our results demonstrate the potential of adaptive gesture recognition systems to improve the accessibility of human-computer interfaces for individuals with motor impairments.
