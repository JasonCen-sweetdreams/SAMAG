Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. This paper proposes a novel ranking-based neural query expansion approach, 'RaNQE', which leverages a neural network to learn semantic query representations. Our approach iteratively expands the query by incorporating relevant terms from the top-ranked documents, while simultaneously refining the query representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RaNQE on several benchmark datasets, including TREC-8 and Gov2, and show significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
