Context-aware retrieval systems aim to capture complex relationships between query and document entities. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that models both local and global contextual dependencies. HGAT employs a hierarchical structure to encode query and document graphs, and attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant entities and their relationships. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset show that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, and provides interpretable insights into the contextual reasoning process.
