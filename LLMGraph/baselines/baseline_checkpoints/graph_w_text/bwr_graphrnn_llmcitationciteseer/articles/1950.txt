Cooperative multi-agent systems often require agents to learn from each other's experiences to achieve common goals. However, existing approaches struggle to scale to large agent populations and complex graph-structured environments. This paper proposes a novel graph attention network (GAT) architecture, 'CoopGAT', which enables efficient and flexible knowledge sharing among agents. By incorporating attention mechanisms, CoopGAT adaptively weights the importance of neighboring agents' experiences, leading to improved cooperation and faster convergence. Experiments on a range of multi-agent tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of CoopGAT in promoting cooperative behavior and achieving superior performance over baseline methods.
