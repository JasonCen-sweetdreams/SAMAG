Traditional document representation techniques in information retrieval (IR) rely on bag-of-words or shallow neural networks, neglecting the rich structural information present in document graphs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention model, 'GraphIR', which learns to represent documents as a hierarchical composition of node and graph-level features. Experimental results on several benchmark IR datasets demonstrate that GraphIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency, particularly for documents with complex structures and relationships.
