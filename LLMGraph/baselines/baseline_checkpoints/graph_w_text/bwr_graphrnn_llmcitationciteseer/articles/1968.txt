Knowledge graph construction is a crucial step in many artificial intelligence and natural language processing applications. Entity disambiguation (ED) is a key challenge in this process, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in the text. This paper proposes a novel approach to ED using graph attention networks (GATs) that leverages the structural information in the knowledge graph. Our model, called GAT-ED, learns to attend to relevant nodes and edges in the graph to disambiguate entities. We evaluate GAT-ED on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
