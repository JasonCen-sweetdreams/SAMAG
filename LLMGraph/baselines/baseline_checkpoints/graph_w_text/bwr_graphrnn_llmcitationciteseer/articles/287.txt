Optimizing queries on multi-dimensional data is crucial for many applications, including data warehousing, scientific simulations, and machine learning. Existing indexing techniques, such as R-trees and quadtrees, have limitations in terms of query performance and storage efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'HiDim', which combines the strengths of different indexing methods to achieve faster query execution and reduced storage overhead. We evaluate HiDim on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query performance and storage efficiency.
