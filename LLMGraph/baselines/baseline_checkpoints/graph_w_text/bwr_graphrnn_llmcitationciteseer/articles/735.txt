Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Traditional approaches rely on manual tuning or simple heuristics, which often fail to adapt to changing workloads and system dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization framework based on deep reinforcement learning. Our approach learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database system and receiving rewards based on execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of resource consumption.
