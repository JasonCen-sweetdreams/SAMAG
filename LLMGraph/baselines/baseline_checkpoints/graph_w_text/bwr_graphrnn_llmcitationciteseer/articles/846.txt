In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework, 'DMA', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic environments. We design a novel multi-agent Q-network that incorporates graph attention mechanisms to model agent interactions and task dependencies. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that DMA outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
