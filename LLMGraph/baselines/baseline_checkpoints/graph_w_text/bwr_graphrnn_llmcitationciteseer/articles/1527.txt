Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing effective VR experiences remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of anthropomorphic avatars in enhancing user experience in VR. We conducted a user study to investigate how the presence and customizability of avatars influence user engagement, sense of presence, and emotional response. Our results show that users who interacted with customized avatars reported higher levels of engagement and sense of presence, and exhibited increased emotional arousal. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR systems and propose a set of guidelines for incorporating avatars in VR applications.
