Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a massive corpus to answer a given question. Existing dense retriever models, while effective, are computationally expensive and struggle to scale. This paper presents Hierarchical Dense Retrieval (HDR), a novel approach that leverages hierarchical representations to efficiently retrieve passages. HDR employs a lightweight, coarse-grained retriever to identify promising passages, followed by a fine-grained, dense retriever to rank the top candidates. Our experiments on popular ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that HDR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational costs by up to 75%.
