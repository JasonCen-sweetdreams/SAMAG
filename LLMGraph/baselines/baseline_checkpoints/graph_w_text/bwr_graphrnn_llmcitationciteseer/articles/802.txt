Ad-hoc information retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to semantic query expansion using graph attention networks (GATs). By modeling the query and document graphs as heterogeneous networks, our approach leverages attention mechanisms to identify salient entities and relationships, thereby enhancing the retrieval process. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for queries with ambiguous or complex semantics.
