In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework, 'DHAT-MA', which leverages distributed hash tables (DHTs) to enable agents to autonomously allocate tasks. We propose a hierarchical DHT structure that allows agents to discover and allocate tasks in a self-organized manner, while ensuring load balancing and minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of DHAT-MA in achieving higher task completion rates and lower response times compared to traditional centralized approaches.
