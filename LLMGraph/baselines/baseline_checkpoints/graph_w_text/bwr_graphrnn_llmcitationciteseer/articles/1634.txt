As robots increasingly collaborate with humans in shared workspaces, understanding the factors that influence trust is crucial. This study explores the role of embodiment in human-robot collaboration, examining how the physical presence and anthropomorphic design of robots affect users' trust and cooperation. Our user study involves 120 participants interacting with either an embodied or non-embodied robot in a collaborative task, with results showing that embodiment significantly enhances trust and task performance. We discuss the implications for designing more effective and trustworthy human-robot collaboration systems.
