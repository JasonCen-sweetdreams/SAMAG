Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments face the challenge of adapting to changing circumstances while negotiating with other agents to achieve their goals. This paper proposes a hybrid negotiation strategy that combines machine learning-based opponent modeling with game-theoretic analysis. Our approach enables agents to reason about the uncertainty of their opponents' behaviors and adjust their negotiation tactics accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid strategy outperforms existing approaches in achieving efficient and fair agreements in a variety of scenarios.
