Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a massive corpus to answer a given question. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) framework that significantly improves the efficiency of passage retrieval in ODQA. Our approach leverages a two-stage retriever: a coarse-grained retriever uses a lightweight dense embedding to filter out irrelevant passages, and a fine-grained retriever uses a more computationally expensive dense embedding to rank the remaining passages. We demonstrate that HDR achieves a 3x speedup over state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods while maintaining comparable accuracy on several ODQA benchmarks.
