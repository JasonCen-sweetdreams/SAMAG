This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using neural embeddings, which significantly improves the retrieval performance of search engines. Our method, called NeuroQE, leverages pre-trained language models to generate semantically rich query representations. These representations are then used to expand the original query, incorporating relevant terms and concepts. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision and a 20% increase in recall.
