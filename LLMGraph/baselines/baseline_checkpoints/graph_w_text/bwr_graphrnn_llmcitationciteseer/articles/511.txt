Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, but real-time inference remains a significant challenge, particularly for high-resolution images. We propose a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages self-attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant regions and scales. Our approach enables efficient feature extraction, reducing computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN on various benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on COCO and VOC datasets while operating at 30 FPS on 1080p images.
