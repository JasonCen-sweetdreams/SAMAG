The proliferation of IoT sensor networks has led to an explosion of data generation, posing significant challenges for real-time data integration and processing. This paper proposes a novel in-memory data grid architecture, 'IoT-Grid', designed to handle high-volume, high-velocity IoT data streams. By leveraging distributed in-memory caching and parallel processing, IoT-Grid achieves orders-of-magnitude performance improvements over traditional disk-based data integration approaches. We evaluate IoT-Grid using a large-scale industrial IoT dataset and demonstrate its ability to support real-time data analytics and machine learning workloads.
