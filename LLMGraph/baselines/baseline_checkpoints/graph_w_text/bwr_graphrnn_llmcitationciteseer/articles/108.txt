RDF triple stores have become a crucial component in various data-intensive applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using graph embeddings. We propose a neural network-based model, 'RDFEmb', which learns a dense representation of RDF graphs and exploits these embeddings to identify optimal query plans. Experimental results on popular RDF benchmarks demonstrate that RDFEmb outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, reducing query execution time by up to 40% and improving scalability for large-scale RDF datasets.
