Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but current AR interfaces often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel, inclusive AR framework that leverages haptic feedback, audio cues, and object recognition to provide an immersive experience for visually impaired users. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that our framework improved task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional AR interfaces. Our work contributes to the development of more accessible and inclusive AR systems that can benefit a broader range of users.
