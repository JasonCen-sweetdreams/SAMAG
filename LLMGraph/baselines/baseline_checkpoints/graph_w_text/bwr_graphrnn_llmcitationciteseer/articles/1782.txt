This study explores the role of embodiment in virtual reality (VR) on users' sense of social presence. We conducted a within-subjects experiment, where participants interacted with a virtual avatar in a collaborative task, either with a fully tracked body or a simplified, non-tracked representation. Our results show that full-body tracking significantly enhances social presence, particularly in terms of perceived co-presence and mutual understanding. Furthermore, we found that the effects of embodiment on social presence are mediated by the user's sense of agency and self-presence in the virtual environment. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems that aim to facilitate social interaction and collaboration.
