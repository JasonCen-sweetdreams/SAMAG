Column-oriented NoSQL databases have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to handle large-scale data analytics workloads. However, query processing remains a significant bottleneck in these systems. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, called 'ColIndex', that leverages the columnar storage layout to accelerate query execution. ColIndex uses a combination of in-memory indexing and disk-based storage to achieve low query latency and high throughput. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColIndex outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
