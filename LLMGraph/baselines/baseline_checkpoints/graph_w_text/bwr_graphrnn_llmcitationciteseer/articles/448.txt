Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) offer a promising approach to image classification by providing uncertainty estimates and improved robustness. However, their computational cost and memory requirements hinder their deployment in real-time applications. This paper presents 'BayesNet', a scalable BNN architecture that leverages a hierarchical variance decomposition and a novel, efficient sampling scheme. We demonstrate BayesNet's performance on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and uncertainty estimates while reducing computational overhead by an order of magnitude.
