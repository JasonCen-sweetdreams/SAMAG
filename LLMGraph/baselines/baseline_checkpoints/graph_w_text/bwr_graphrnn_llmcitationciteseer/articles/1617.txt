Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroXpand', which leverages neural semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and relevant documents. By integrating a pre-trained language model with a custom-designed semantic similarity metric, our method generates high-quality expansion terms that improve retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant gains in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain over state-of-the-art baselines.
