Faceted search is a crucial component of modern search engines, enabling users to filter search results by various attributes. However, existing document representation methods are limited in their ability to effectively capture faceted information. This paper proposes a novel document representation learning framework, 'FacRep', which incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to model faceted relationships. We demonstrate that FacRep significantly improves the performance of faceted search tasks, achieving an average gain of 12.5% in precision and 15.2% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods on a benchmark dataset.
