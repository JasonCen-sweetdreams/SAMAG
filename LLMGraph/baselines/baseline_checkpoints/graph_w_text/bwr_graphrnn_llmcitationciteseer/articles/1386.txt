Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but its cognitive implications are not yet fully understood. This study explores the relationship between gestural interaction, cognitive load, and embodied cognition in VR. We designed an experiment where participants performed a series of tasks in a VR environment, using either gestures or controllers. Our results show that gestural interaction reduces cognitive load and enhances embodied cognition, leading to improved task performance and user experience. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR systems and their potential applications in fields such as education and therapy.
