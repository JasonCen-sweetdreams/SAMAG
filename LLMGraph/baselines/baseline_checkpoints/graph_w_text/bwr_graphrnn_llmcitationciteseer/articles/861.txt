With the increasing prevalence of semi-structured data, traditional indexing techniques often struggle to balance query performance and storage efficiency. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach, 'FlexIndex', which combines the benefits of inverted indexing and graph-based indexing. FlexIndex adaptively partitions the data into structured and unstructured regions, leveraging the strengths of each indexing method. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset of JSON documents demonstrate that FlexIndex achieves a 2-3x speedup in query response time compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques, while reducing storage overhead by up to 40%.
