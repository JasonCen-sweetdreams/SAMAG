Urban traffic management is a complex problem that requires coordinating the actions of multiple agents, such as traffic lights and autonomous vehicles. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to train a decentralized multi-agent system for urban traffic management. Our approach, called 'TrafficMAgent', uses a graph-based representation of the traffic network and incorporates domain-specific knowledge to guide the learning process. Experimental results using a realistic traffic simulator demonstrate that TrafficMAgent outperforms traditional optimization methods in reducing congestion and travel times, while adapting to changing traffic conditions.
