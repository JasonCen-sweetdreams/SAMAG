Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of individuals with disabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for designing inclusive conversational systems that cater to diverse abilities. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with disabilities, revealing key barriers and preferences in conversational interactions. Our framework, 'InConverse', integrates multimodal input mechanisms, adaptive dialogue management, and personalized accessibility features. We evaluate InConverse through a prototype implementation, demonstrating improved user satisfaction and task completion rates for individuals with visual, hearing, and motor impairments.
