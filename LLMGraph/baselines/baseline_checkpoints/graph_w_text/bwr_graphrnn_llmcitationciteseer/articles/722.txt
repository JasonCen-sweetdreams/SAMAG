With the increasing adoption of distributed column-stores for real-time analytics, query optimization has become a critical bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'Columbo', that leverages machine learning-based cost modeling and adaptive indexing. Columbo dynamically adjusts the query plan based on column statistics, data distribution, and system workload, resulting in significant performance gains. We evaluate Columbo on a real-world financial dataset and demonstrate an average query speedup of 3.2x compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
