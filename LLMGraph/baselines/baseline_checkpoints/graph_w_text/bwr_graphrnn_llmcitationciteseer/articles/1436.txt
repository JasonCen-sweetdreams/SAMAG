As document collections continue to grow in size, the efficiency of query expansion techniques becomes paramount for effective information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, HQE, which leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and documents to identify the most informative expansion terms. HQE uses a probabilistic topic modeling approach to generate a hierarchical representation of the document collection, enabling more accurate and efficient query expansion. Experimental results on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
