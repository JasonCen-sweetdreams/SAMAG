In complex multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a hierarchical architecture that combines a high-level task allocator with low-level agent controllers, enabling agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and heterogeneous capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system efficiency compared to traditional optimization-based approaches.
