Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance on various graph-based tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks on graph structures has raised concerns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph rewiring approach to enhance the robustness of GNNs against adversarial attacks. Our method iteratively identifies and rewires critical edges in the graph to reduce the impact of perturbations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in robustness metrics, including attack success rate and perturbation tolerance, while maintaining competitive performance on clean data. We also provide theoretical insights into the connection between graph rewiring and GNN's robustness.
