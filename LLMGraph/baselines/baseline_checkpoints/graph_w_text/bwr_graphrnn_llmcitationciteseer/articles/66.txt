In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires coordinating agents to achieve common goals. This paper presents a novel distributed constraint optimization approach for task allocation, which leverages the strengths of both constraint programming and distributed problem-solving. Our proposed algorithm, called DCA-TA, enables agents to autonomously assign tasks while respecting global constraints and minimizing conflicts. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DCA-TA outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and overall system efficiency.
