Object detection is a critical component of autonomous vehicle systems, requiring real-time performance and high accuracy. This paper proposes a novel attention mechanism, 'EagleEye', which selectively focuses on regions of interest in the input image, reducing computational cost while maintaining detection accuracy. We leverage a lightweight neural network architecture and a novel attention weighting scheme, enabling our system to operate at 30 frames per second on embedded hardware. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that EagleEye achieves state-of-the-art performance on object detection tasks while reducing computational overhead by 35%.
