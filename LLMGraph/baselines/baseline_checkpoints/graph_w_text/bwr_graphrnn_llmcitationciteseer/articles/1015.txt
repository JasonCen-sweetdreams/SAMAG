Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents an inclusive VR interface design framework that incorporates audio-haptic feedback and sonification techniques to facilitate navigation and interaction for visually impaired users. We conducted user studies with 20 participants and found that our design significantly improves task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our framework provides a foundation for creating accessible VR experiences that can benefit a broader range of users.
