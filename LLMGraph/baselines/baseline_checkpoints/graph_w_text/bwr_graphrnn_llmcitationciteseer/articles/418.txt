Traditional query optimization techniques in relational databases rely on manual indexing and rule-based optimization, leading to suboptimal performance and high maintenance costs. This paper proposes 'QLearn', a novel approach that leverages learned index structures to enable real-time query optimization. QLearn uses a neural network to predict optimal index structures based on query patterns and database statistics, achieving up to 3x query performance improvement and 2x indexing space reduction compared to state-of-the-art techniques. We evaluate QLearn on various real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in adaptively optimizing query performance under changing workloads.
