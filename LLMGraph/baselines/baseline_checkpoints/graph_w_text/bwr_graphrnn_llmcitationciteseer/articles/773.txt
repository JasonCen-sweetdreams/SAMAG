The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms has severe consequences for individuals and society. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) architecture for fake news detection. Our model leverages graph attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between news articles, users, and their social connections. We introduce an interpretable attention-based explanation module that identifies the most influential users and news articles contributing to the classification decision. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that our HGNN outperforms state-of-the-art fake news detection methods while providing transparent and actionable insights into the decision-making process.
