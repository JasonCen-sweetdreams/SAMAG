E-commerce search engines struggle to provide accurate results due to the ambiguity and diversity of user queries. We propose a novel embedding-based query expansion approach, 'QUEE', which leverages pre-trained language models to capture semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. QUEE generates a set of expanded queries that are semantically close to the original query, and then uses a supervised ranking model to re-rank the retrieved documents. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that QUEE improves the mean average precision by 12% compared to traditional query expansion methods, while reducing the computational overhead by 30%.
