Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the speech recognition performance and interaction patterns of older adults with voice assistants. Our results show that existing systems struggle to recognize speech from older adults, particularly those with mild cognitive impairments. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants, including personalized speech recognition models, simplified dialogue flows, and multimodal feedback mechanisms. Our findings have implications for the development of more accessible and usable voice assistants for older adults.
