Passage retrieval is a crucial component of modern question answering systems. However, existing methods often rely on dense vector representations of documents, leading to high computational costs and memory requirements. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document representation scheme, 'QDDR', which selectively encodes only the most relevant passages in a document based on the query context. Our approach leverages a combination of sparse attention mechanisms and hierarchical document encoding to reduce the dimensionality of the representation space. Experimental results on the TREC CAR dataset demonstrate that QDDR achieves significant improvements in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.
