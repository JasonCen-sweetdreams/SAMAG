The proliferation of IoT devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation mechanisms to ensure real-time processing and minimize latency. This paper presents 'DARA', a distributed agent-based framework that leverages decentralized decision-making to allocate resources in IoT systems. We model the resource allocation problem as a multi-agent decision-making process, where each agent represents an IoT device. We propose a novel negotiation protocol that enables agents to exchange information and negotiate resource allocations in real-time. Experimental results show that DARA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of response time, resource utilization, and adaptability to dynamic changes in IoT system topology.
