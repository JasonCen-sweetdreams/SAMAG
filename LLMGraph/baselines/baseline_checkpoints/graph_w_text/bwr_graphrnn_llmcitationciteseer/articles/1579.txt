Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments require efficient task allocation strategies to ensure effective collaboration. This paper presents a decentralized approach, 'DynCAT', which leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and adapt to changing constraints. Our approach incorporates a novel constraint propagation mechanism, enabling agents to negotiate task assignments in real-time while respecting feasibility constraints. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of DynCAT in reducing task completion time and improving overall system resilience compared to centralized allocation methods.
