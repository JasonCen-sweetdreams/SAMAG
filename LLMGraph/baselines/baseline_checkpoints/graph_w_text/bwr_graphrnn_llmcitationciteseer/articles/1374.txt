Passage retrieval is a crucial step in many information retrieval applications, including open-domain question answering and dialogue systems. However, the computational cost of dense passage retrieval methods hinders their deployment in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation framework, 'HierDoc', which leverages a multi-resolution grid-based index to efficiently prune irrelevant passages. We demonstrate that HierDoc achieves significant speedups over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy on several benchmark datasets.
