Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly prevalent in various domains, but the impact of haptic feedback on user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive study examining the effects of haptic feedback on user experience in VR. We designed and conducted a user study with 40 participants, who performed a series of tasks in a VR environment with and without haptic feedback. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly enhances user engagement, reduces motion sickness, and improves task performance. We also identify key factors influencing the effectiveness of haptic feedback, including the type of haptic device and the complexity of the task. The findings of this study have implications for the design of VR systems and applications.
