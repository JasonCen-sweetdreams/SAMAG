Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using context-aware embeddings, which incorporate both semantic and syntactic information from the query context. Our method, dubbed 'EmbedEx', leverages a graph-based neural network to learn contextualized representations of query terms and their relationships. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmbedEx significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, particularly in scenarios with ambiguous or underspecified queries.
