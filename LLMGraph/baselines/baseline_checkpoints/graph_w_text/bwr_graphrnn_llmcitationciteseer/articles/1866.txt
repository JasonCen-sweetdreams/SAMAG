Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) systems struggle with query performance due to the complexity of index management and data distribution. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HierDir', which exploits the hierarchical structure of the dataset to optimize query routing and processing. By dynamically adjusting the indexing granularity and leveraging a two-stage query processing mechanism, HierDir significantly improves query response times and reduces network latency. Experimental results on a large-scale DIR benchmark demonstrate the superiority of HierDir over existing indexing techniques.
