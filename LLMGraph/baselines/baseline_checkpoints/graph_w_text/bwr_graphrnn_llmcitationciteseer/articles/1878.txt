Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on effective passage retrieval to identify relevant contexts from a massive corpus. This paper presents a novel approach to passage retrieval using hierarchical sentence embeddings, which capture both local and global semantic relationships within a passage. Our method, 'HierSent', represents sentences as hierarchical graphs and learns to embed them in a dense vector space. We demonstrate that HierSent outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods on several ODQA benchmarks, achieving a 12% improvement in top-1 passage accuracy and a 20% reduction in computational cost.
