In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that affects overall system performance. This paper proposes a novel autonomous task allocation framework using reinforcement learning. Our approach, 'MA-RL', leverages a decentralized, multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to learn optimal task assignments in dynamic environments. We evaluate MA-RL on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and system efficiency compared to traditional, centralized allocation methods. The proposed framework has potential applications in various domains, including search and rescue, logistics, and smart cities.
