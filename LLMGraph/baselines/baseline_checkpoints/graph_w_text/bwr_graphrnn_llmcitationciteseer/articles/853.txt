Distributed time-series databases (DTSDBs) are increasingly used for large-scale IoT and sensor data management. Efficient range query processing is crucial for many applications, but existing indexing techniques are either too space-consuming or sacrifice query performance. This paper presents 'RITree', a novel, distributed indexing approach that adapts to the underlying data distribution and query patterns. RITree constructs a hierarchical tree structure, where each node represents a compact, lossy summary of the data. Experimental evaluation on a real-world DTSDB deployment shows that RITree reduces query latency by up to 5x and storage overhead by 3x compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods.
