As multimodal interaction data becomes increasingly prevalent, effective visualization techniques are crucial for facilitating collaborative analysis. This paper presents 'MIVIS', a novel visualization framework designed to integrate and represent multiple modalities of interaction data, including speech, gesture, and gaze. MIVIS employs a hybrid approach, combining both summary-based and detail-on-demand visualization techniques to support diverse analytical tasks. We evaluate MIVIS through a user study, demonstrating its ability to enhance collaborative analysis and decision-making in multimodal interaction data.
