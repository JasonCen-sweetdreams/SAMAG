Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments require efficient coordination mechanisms to achieve complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task network (HTN) framework for agent coordination, which integrates planning, execution, and monitoring capabilities. Our approach leverages a layered architecture, where high-level tasks are decomposed into lower-level subtasks, enabling agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our HTN framework in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional decentralized approaches.
