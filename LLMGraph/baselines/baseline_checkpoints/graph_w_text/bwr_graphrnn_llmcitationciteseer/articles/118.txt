Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their dialogue management systems often fail to accommodate users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel context-aware dialogue management approach that adapts to the needs of users with disabilities. Our system incorporates a probabilistic user model that infers user preferences and abilities from conversation history and sensor data. We evaluate our approach using a Wizard-of-Oz study with 30 participants, including users with visual, hearing, and motor impairments, and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction. Our findings inform the design of more inclusive voice assistants that can better support users with diverse abilities.
