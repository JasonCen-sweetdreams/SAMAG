Virtual reality (VR) technology has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but user experience can be compromised by cumbersome interfaces. This paper presents an innovative eye-tracking-based intelligent interface, 'EyeGuide', which leverages machine learning to predict user intentions and optimize interaction in VR environments. EyeGuide incorporates a deep neural network that analyzes user gaze patterns to infer semantic meaning, enabling intuitive and gesture-free navigation. Our user study demonstrates significant improvements in user satisfaction, task completion time, and subjective experience, paving the way for more accessible and immersive VR applications.
