Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and node heterogeneity. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DistroOpt', which leverages machine learning and graph theory to optimize query plans for DDS. We introduce a hierarchical clustering approach to group nodes based on their data distribution and a reinforcement learning-based query planning algorithm to minimize query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DistroOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
