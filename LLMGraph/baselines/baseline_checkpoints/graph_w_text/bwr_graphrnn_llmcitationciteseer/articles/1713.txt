Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular in modern data management, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for efficient query optimization in distributed relational databases. We model the database as a graph, where nodes represent relations and edges represent joins. We then leverage graph algorithms to identify optimal query execution plans, reducing the search space and improving query performance. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
