Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education, but the cognitive load imposed by VR interfaces can negatively impact learning outcomes. This study investigates the effect of gesture recognition on cognitive load in VR-based learning environments. We designed an experiment involving 30 participants who interacted with a VR-based educational simulation using either gesture recognition or traditional input methods. Our results show that gesture recognition significantly reduces cognitive load, improving user experience and learning retention. We also identify key design implications for VR-based educational systems.
