The increasing popularity of chatbots has led to a growing concern about their accessibility for older adults. This study investigates the design of multimodal chatbots that cater to the needs of older adults, focusing on speech, text, and gesture-based interactions. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, aged 65-85, to evaluate the usability and user experience of three chatbot prototypes. Our results highlight the importance of adaptive dialogue management, clear visual cues, and intuitive gesture recognition for enhancing accessibility. We provide design implications for creating inclusive chatbots that support healthy aging and social inclusion.
