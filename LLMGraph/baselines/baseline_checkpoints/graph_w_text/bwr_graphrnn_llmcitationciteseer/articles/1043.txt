Short-text retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval due to the limited context and ambiguity of query terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of query terms and documents. Specifically, we employ a multi-task learning approach that combines query term embeddings with a relevance-based ranking model. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving improvements in both precision and recall.
