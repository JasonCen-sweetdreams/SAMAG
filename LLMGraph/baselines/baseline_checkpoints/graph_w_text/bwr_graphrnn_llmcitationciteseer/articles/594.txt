State-of-the-art recommendation systems rely on Euclidean geometry-based graph neural networks, which struggle to model complex relationships in large-scale graphs. This paper introduces HyperGAT, a novel graph attention network that leverages hyperbolic geometry to capture hierarchical and scale-free properties of user-item interactions. By incorporating hyperbolic attention mechanisms, HyperGAT achieves significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and scalability on several benchmark datasets, while reducing computational complexity. We provide theoretical insights into the expressiveness of hyperbolic graph representations and demonstrate the efficacy of HyperGAT in real-world recommender systems.
