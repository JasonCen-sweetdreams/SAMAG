Materialized views are essential for fast query processing in data warehousing, but maintaining them incrementally as the underlying data changes is a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'IVM-RT', which leverages a hybrid data structure combining trie-based indexing and bloom filters to efficiently identify and update affected view tuples. Our experiments on a real-world benchmark dataset demonstrate that IVM-RT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by up to 3x in terms of update latency and 2x in terms of space efficiency, making it suitable for real-time data warehousing applications.
