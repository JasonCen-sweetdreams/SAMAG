Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a human-centered design approach to create accessible conversational interfaces tailored to this population. We conducted interviews and usability studies with 20 older adults with mild cognitive impairments, identifying key challenges and design recommendations. Our proposed interface, 'CogChat', incorporates features such as simplified language, visual cues, and error forgiveness. Evaluation results show that CogChat significantly improves usability and reduces frustration for older adults with cognitive impairments, enabling them to more effectively interact with conversational systems.
