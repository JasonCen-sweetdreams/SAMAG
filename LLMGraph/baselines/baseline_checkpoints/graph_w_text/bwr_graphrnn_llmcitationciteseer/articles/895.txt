In real-world scenarios, multi-agent systems often face incomplete information about their environment, leading to suboptimal planning. This paper presents a novel distributed planning framework, 'InfoGap', that enables agents to reason about uncertainty and adapt to new information. We introduce a probabilistic graphical model to represent agents' beliefs and develop a decentralized planning algorithm that leverages local observations to reduce uncertainty. Experimental results on a rescue robotics domain demonstrate that InfoGap outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time and robustness to incomplete information.
