This paper addresses the problem of distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to be assigned to tasks with different requirements. We propose a novel auction-based mechanism that leverages the agents' bids to determine the optimal task allocation. Our approach ensures that tasks are allocated efficiently, taking into account the agents' preferences and capabilities, while minimizing the overall system cost. We evaluate our mechanism through simulations and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving better task allocation outcomes compared to traditional centralized approaches.
