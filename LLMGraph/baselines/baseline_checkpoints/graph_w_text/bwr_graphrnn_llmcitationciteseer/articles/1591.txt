We propose a novel neural query expansion approach that leverages deep learning to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of document retrieval in modern search engines. Our method, dubbed 'NQE', utilizes a transformer-based architecture to learn query-document relationships and generate expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval accuracy and query latency, making it a promising solution for large-scale search applications.
