Proximity search is a fundamental operation in many applications, including recommender systems, computer vision, and data mining. However, as the dimensionality of the data increases, traditional indexing methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, Hierarchical Proximity Tree (HPT), which leverages the properties of hierarchical clustering to efficiently prune the search space. We theoretically analyze the performance of HPT and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods on several real-world datasets.
