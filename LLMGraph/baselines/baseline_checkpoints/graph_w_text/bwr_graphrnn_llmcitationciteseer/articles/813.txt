This paper introduces a novel distributed task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. The proposed approach leverages graph attention networks to learn effective representations of agent capabilities and task requirements. We develop a decentralized algorithm that allows agents to negotiate and allocate tasks in a distributed manner, taking into account communication constraints and resource limitations. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing overall system latency compared to existing methods.
