Query expansion is a crucial component in search engines, as it significantly impacts the retrieval performance. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and rule-based approaches, which often fail to capture the complexities of natural language queries. We propose a novel framework, 'DeepQE', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query expansion policy. Our approach utilizes a hierarchical neural network to model the query-document interaction and learns to select the most informative expansion terms in real-time. Experiments on a large-scale Web search dataset demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, achieving a 12.5% improvement in mean average precision.
