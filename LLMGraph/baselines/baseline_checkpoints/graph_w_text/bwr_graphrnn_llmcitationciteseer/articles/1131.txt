Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large volumes of data. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging task. Traditional query optimizers rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, which may not always lead to optimal query plans. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to learn the optimal query plan. Our approach, called 'RLQO', uses a deep Q-network to learn the query optimization policy from a large dataset of queries and their corresponding execution plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that RLQO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
