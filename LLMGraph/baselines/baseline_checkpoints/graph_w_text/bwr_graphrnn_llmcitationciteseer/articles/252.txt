Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for storing and processing large amounts of data. However, indexing techniques used in centralized systems are often inefficient in distributed settings, leading to poor query performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'Distributed Hash Indexing' (DHI), which leverages the distributed nature of the system to improve query efficiency. DHI uses a combination of hash functions and Bloom filters to reduce the number of nodes involved in query processing, resulting in significant performance improvements. Experimental evaluations on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DHI outperforms existing indexing techniques in distributed database systems.
