Distributed databases face significant query processing overhead due to the need to coordinate data access across multiple nodes. Learned index structures have shown promise in improving query performance on centralized databases. This paper explores the application of learned index structures in distributed database settings. We propose a novel distributed learned index framework, 'DistriLex', which leverages parallel processing and data partitioning to accelerate query execution. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that DistriLex achieves up to 3x query performance gains compared to traditional indexing techniques, while maintaining acceptable storage overhead.
