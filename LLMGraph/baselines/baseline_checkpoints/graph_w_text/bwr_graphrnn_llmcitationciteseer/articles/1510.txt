Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-robot collaboration, but the impact of embodiment on collaboration outcomes is not well understood. This study examines how embodiment – the sense of ownership and agency over a virtual body – influences human trust, communication, and task performance in VR-based human-robot collaboration. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR platform and a robot avatar. Our results show that high embodiment is associated with increased trust, more effective communication, and improved task performance. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR-based human-robot collaboration systems.
