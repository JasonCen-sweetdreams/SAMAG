Coordinating task allocation in multi-agent systems is a complex problem, particularly in decentralized settings. This paper presents a novel auction-based mechanism, 'DASM', which enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We leverage a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction design to ensure truthfulness and efficiency, while incorporating a novel 'task clustering' technique to reduce communication overhead. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation scenarios demonstrate that DASM outperforms existing decentralized methods in terms of allocation efficiency and fairness.
