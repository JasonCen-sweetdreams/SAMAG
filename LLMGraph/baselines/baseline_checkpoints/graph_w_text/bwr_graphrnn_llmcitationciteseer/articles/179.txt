This paper addresses the task allocation problem in decentralized multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities and preferences need to allocate tasks to maximize overall system performance. We propose a consensus-based auction mechanism that enables agents to negotiate and agree on task assignments in a distributed manner. Our approach leverages a novel combination of distributed constraint optimization and auction theory to ensure efficient and fair task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods in terms of system utility and fairness.
