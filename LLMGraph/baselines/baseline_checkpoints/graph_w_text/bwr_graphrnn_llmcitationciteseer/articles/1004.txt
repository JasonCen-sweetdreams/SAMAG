We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for distributed resource allocation in complex systems. Our approach, named 'DMA-RL', utilizes a novel communication protocol that enables agents to share knowledge and coordinate their actions in a decentralized manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DMA-RL in a simulated smart grid environment, where it achieves improved resource allocation efficiency and resilience compared to traditional centralized methods. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of DMA-RL and analyze its robustness to agent failures and communication delays.
