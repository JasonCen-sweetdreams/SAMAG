Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent, but their usability for elderly users remains a concern. This paper investigates the impact of conversational strategies on the user experience of elderly individuals interacting with voice assistants. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65+, examining the effects of confirmation, clarification, and error recovery strategies on task completion rates, user satisfaction, and cognitive load. Our results show that a combination of these strategies significantly improves the user experience, and we provide design recommendations for developing more inclusive voice assistants.
