Anomaly detection in multivariate time series (MTS) is crucial for various applications, including IoT and finance. This paper introduces 'HierAno', a deep hierarchical clustering framework that leverages the strengths of both autoencoders and density-based clustering. HierAno learns a hierarchical representation of MTS data, enabling the detection of anomalies at multiple scales and resolutions. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HierAno outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to noisy data.
