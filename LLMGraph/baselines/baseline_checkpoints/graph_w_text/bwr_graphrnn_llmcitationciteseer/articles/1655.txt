This paper presents a novel architecture for multi-task information retrieval, integrating entity disambiguation with BERT-based ranking models. Our approach leverages the strengths of both tasks to improve the overall retrieval performance. We propose a hierarchical neural network that jointly learns to disambiguate entities and rank documents, exploiting the semantic relationships between entities and their contextualized representations. Experimental results on a large-scale benchmark dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and entity disambiguation F1-score compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
