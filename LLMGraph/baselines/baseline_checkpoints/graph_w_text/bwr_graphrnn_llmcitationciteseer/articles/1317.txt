Query expansion is a crucial step in patent retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on manual thesaurus construction or simplistic term weighting. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep neural models to learn semantic representations of patent queries and documents. We propose a hierarchical attention-based neural network that captures both local and global context in patent texts, and demonstrate its effectiveness in enhancing query expansion for patent retrieval tasks. Experimental results on a large-scale patent corpus show significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods.
