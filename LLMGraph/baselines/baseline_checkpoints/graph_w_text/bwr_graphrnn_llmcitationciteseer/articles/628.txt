Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it aims to capture the underlying user intent behind a query. Traditional query expansion methods rely on hand-crafted rules or term co-occurrence analysis, which can be limited by their simplicity and lack of adaptability. This paper proposes a novel deep neural model, 'QNLP', which leverages the power of semantic embeddings and contextualized language representations to learn effective query expansion strategies. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QNLP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly for ambiguous and multi-faceted queries.
