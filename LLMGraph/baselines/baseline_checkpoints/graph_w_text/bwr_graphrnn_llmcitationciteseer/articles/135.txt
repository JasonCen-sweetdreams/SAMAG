Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various graph-based applications. However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that manipulate the graph structure or node features to mislead the model. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect such attacks using Graph Autoencoders (GAEs). We design a GAE-based anomaly detector that learns to reconstruct the graph and identify perturbations introduced by adversarial attacks. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in detecting attacks with high accuracy and F1-score, outperforming existing methods.
