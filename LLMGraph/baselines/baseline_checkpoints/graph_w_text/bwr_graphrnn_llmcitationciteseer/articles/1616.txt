Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems rely on bag-of-words representations, which fail to capture complex document structures and relationships. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) architecture for document retrieval, which models documents as graph-structured data and learns to aggregate information from multiple scales. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art IR methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency, while providing interpretable document representations.
