Virtual reality (VR) systems aim to provide immersive experiences, but the lack of haptic feedback can lead to a sense of disconnection from the virtual environment. This paper presents a study on the impact of haptic feedback on user experience in VR. We designed and implemented a custom VR system with a haptic feedback device and conducted a user study with 30 participants. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user engagement, presence, and overall satisfaction in VR. We also identify key factors influencing the effectiveness of haptic feedback, including the type of haptic cue and the level of vibration intensity.
