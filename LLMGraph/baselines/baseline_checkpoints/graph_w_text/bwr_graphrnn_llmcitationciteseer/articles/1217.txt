Join order optimization is a crucial component of modern database query optimization. However, existing approaches rely on outdated cost models and fail to account for the complexities of contemporary database systems. This paper presents a novel join order optimization framework, 'JOOX', which leverages machine learning and query workload analysis to adapt to diverse database environments. We introduce a probabilistic cost model that incorporates factors such as CPU and I/O resource utilization, data distribution, and query concurrency. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that JOOX improves query performance by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
