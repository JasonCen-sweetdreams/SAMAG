Traditional ranking models for information retrieval often suffer from high computational complexity and inadequate document representation. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention-based document ranking framework, 'HADRank', which leverages both local and global contextual information to improve retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. HADRank employs a two-stage attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant document regions and encode them into a compact, dense representation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ranking accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models.
