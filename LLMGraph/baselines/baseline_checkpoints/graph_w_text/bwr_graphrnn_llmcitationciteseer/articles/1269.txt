Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task, particularly in the presence of dynamic workloads and heterogeneous hardware configurations. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, which learns to adapt to changing database conditions and optimizes query execution plans accordingly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a real-world dataset and show significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
