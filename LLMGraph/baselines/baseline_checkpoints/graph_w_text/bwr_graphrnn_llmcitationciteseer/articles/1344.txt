As human-AI collaboration becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the cognitive and behavioral factors that influence human performance is crucial. This study explores the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, where users interact with AI agents using gestures and body language. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, analyzing their problem-solving strategies and communication patterns in VR. Our results show that embodied cognition significantly enhances human-AI collaboration, improving task efficiency and reducing errors. We discuss the implications for designing more effective and intuitive human-AI interfaces, highlighting the potential of VR-based training for complex tasks.
