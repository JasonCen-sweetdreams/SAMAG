In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task assignment strategies. Our approach, dubbed 'GraphAgent', represents the agent-task graph as a dynamic neural network, enabling agents to learn from local observations and adapt to changing task requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphAgent in simulated robotics and sensor network scenarios, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
