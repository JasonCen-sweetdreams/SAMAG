Virtual assistants (VAs) are increasingly integrated into daily life, but user trust remains a significant hurdle to widespread adoption. This study investigates the effect of anthropomorphic design elements on user trust in VAs. We conducted a between-subjects experiment with 120 participants, exposing them to either an anthropomorphized or non-anthropomorphized VA. Results show that users who interacted with the anthropomorphized VA reported higher trust and perceived the VA as more relatable and competent. However, we also found that these effects were mitigated when users experienced errors or inconsistencies in the VA's responses. Our findings provide insights for designers and developers seeking to establish trust with VA users, highlighting the importance of balancing anthropomorphic design with system reliability and transparency.
