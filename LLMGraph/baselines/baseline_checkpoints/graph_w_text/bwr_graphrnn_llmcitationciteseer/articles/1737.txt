Multi-agent planning has numerous applications in areas such as robotics, logistics, and smart cities. However, the complexity of planning tasks increases exponentially with the number of agents, making it challenging to scale to real-world problems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task network (HTN) framework for efficient multi-agent planning. Our approach decomposes complex tasks into smaller subtasks, allowing agents to coordinate and execute plans more effectively. We develop a set of heuristics to guide the decomposition process and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a range of multi-agent planning scenarios.
