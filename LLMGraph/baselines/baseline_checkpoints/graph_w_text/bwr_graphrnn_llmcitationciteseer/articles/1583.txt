Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has achieved state-of-the-art results in open-domain question answering by leveraging dense vector representations of passages. However, DPR models often struggle to retrieve relevant documents when the query lacks sufficient context or contains ambiguous terms. This paper proposes a query-driven document expansion approach, 'QDE', which generates additional context-aware passages from the top-retrieved documents. Our experiments on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that QDE significantly improves the retrieval performance of DPR models, especially for queries with low lexical overlap with the relevant documents.
