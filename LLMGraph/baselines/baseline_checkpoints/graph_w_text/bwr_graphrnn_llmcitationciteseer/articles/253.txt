Distributed data warehouses (DDWs) are increasingly used to store and process large amounts of data. However, optimizing queries in DDWs remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL framework that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the feedback from the environment, i.e., the DDW system. Our experimental results on a real-world DDW dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
