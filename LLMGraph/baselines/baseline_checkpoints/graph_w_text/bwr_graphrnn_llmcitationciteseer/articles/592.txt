Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) often contain complex relationships between nodes of different types. Node classification in HINs is a challenging task due to the varying importance of different node types and relationships. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that learns to selectively focus on relevant nodes and relationships when classifying target nodes. HGAT consists of multiple attention layers that capture node- and relation-level attention, enabling the model to adapt to the heterogeneous structure of the network. Experiments on several benchmark HIN datasets demonstrate the superiority of HGAT over state-of-the-art methods for node classification tasks.
