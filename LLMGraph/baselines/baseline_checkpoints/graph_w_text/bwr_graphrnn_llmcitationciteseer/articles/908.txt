As distributed databases continue to grow in scale and complexity, query optimization becomes an increasingly important challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GIDX', which leverages graph theory to efficiently identify optimal query plans. By modeling the database as a graph and applying graph-based algorithms, GIDX reduces the search space for query optimization, resulting in significant performance improvements. Experiments on a real-world distributed database show that GIDX outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 3x in query execution time.
