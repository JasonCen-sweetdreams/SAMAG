Cognitive load management is crucial in interactive systems, as excessive load can lead to user frustration and decreased performance. This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive visualization design, 'CogVis', which dynamically adjusts visualization complexity based on real-time user behavior and cognitive load metrics. Our approach integrates EEG-based cognitive load measurement, machine learning-driven visualization optimization, and human-centered design principles. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that CogVis significantly reduces cognitive load, improves task completion time, and enhances user experience in complex data exploration tasks.
