Ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using meta-learning, which enables the IR system to adapt to new queries and domains with limited training data. Our method, 'MetaQE', learns to generate query expansions by training a meta-model on a diverse set of IR tasks. We evaluate MetaQE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
