Gestural interfaces have become increasingly prevalent in various devices, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with motor impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive gestural interfaces for this population. We conducted a comprehensive study involving 30 participants with motor impairments, identifying key challenges and preferences. Our proposed interface, 'EasyGesture', incorporates adaptive gesture recognition, personalized feedback, and accessible navigation. A usability evaluation with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion time, accuracy, and user satisfaction compared to traditional gestural interfaces.
