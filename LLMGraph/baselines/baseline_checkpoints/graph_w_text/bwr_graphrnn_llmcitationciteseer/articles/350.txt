Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus and generating answers. This paper proposes a novel re-ranking approach that leverages query-specific dense passage retrieval (QSDPR) to improve the accuracy of ODQA systems. We introduce a neural re-ranker that takes into account the semantic similarity between the query and passage representations, as well as the relevance of the passage to the query. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset show that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art ODQA models, achieving a 3.5% absolute improvement in exact match accuracy.
