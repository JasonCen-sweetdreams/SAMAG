Search engines often struggle to retrieve diverse results, leading to a poor user experience. This paper presents a novel neural query expansion method, 'NQE-Div', which incorporates a diversity-promoting regularizer into the training objective. Our approach leverages a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query similarity and document diversity. Experiments on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate that NQE-Div significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of novelty and diversity metrics, while maintaining comparable relevance scores.
