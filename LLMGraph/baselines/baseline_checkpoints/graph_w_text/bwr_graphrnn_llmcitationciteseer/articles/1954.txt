Autonomous vehicles rely on accurate object detection to ensure safe navigation. However, detecting novel classes not seen during training is a significant challenge. This paper introduces 'AV-ZSL', a zero-shot learning framework that leverages semantic embeddings and graph neural networks to recognize novel classes. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the popular KITTI dataset, with an average precision of 84.2% on novel classes. We also propose a novel metric, 'Novelty-Aware mAP', to evaluate the performance of zero-shot learning methods in autonomous driving scenarios.
