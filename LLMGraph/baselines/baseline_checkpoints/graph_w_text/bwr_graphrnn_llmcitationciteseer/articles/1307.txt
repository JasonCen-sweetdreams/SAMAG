Healthcare information retrieval (HIR) systems struggle to capture the nuances of medical queries, leading to poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a context-aware query expansion (CAQE) framework that incorporates domain knowledge and user intent to improve retrieval accuracy. CAQE leverages a hybrid approach combining ontological and lexical semantic analysis to generate context-dependent query expansions. Experimental results on a large-scale medical dataset demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving an average precision gain of 23.1% and a mean reciprocal rank improvement of 18.5%.
