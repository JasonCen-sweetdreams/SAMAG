Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize social interactions, but existing avatars often lack emotional expressiveness, limiting user engagement and inclusivity. This paper presents a novel framework for designing emotive avatars that can convey nuanced emotions and personalities. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, using a combination of facial recognition, gesture analysis, and emotional intelligence metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our emotive avatars significantly increase user feelings of empathy, presence, and social connection in VR environments. We discuss implications for accessible VR experiences and future research directions.
