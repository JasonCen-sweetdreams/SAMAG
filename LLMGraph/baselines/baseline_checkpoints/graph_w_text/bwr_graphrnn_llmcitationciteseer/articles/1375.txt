Traditional information retrieval systems rely on manually crafted query models, which often fail to capture complex relationships between query terms. We propose a novel neural approach, 'QueryGraph', which generates a query graph from a natural language query and leverages graph neural networks for document ranking. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QueryGraph outperforms state-of-the-art models, such as BERT-based rankers, in terms of precision, recall, and NDCG. We also show that QueryGraph can be effectively used for query expansion and reformulation, leading to further improvements in retrieval performance.
