As the global population ages, designing accessible interfaces for older adults with motor impairments is crucial. This paper presents a novel approach to touchless gesture recognition, tailored to the needs of older adults with motor impairments. We propose a machine learning-based framework that leverages depth sensors and computer vision to detect and recognize gestures, eliminating the need for precise finger movements. Our user study with 20 older adults with motor impairments shows that our approach achieves an average recognition accuracy of 92.5%, outperforming existing touch-based interfaces. We also provide design guidelines for creating accessible touchless gestures, highlighting the importance of speed, amplitude, and movement trajectory.
