Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments face the challenge of adapting to changing task requirements and constraints. This paper presents a novel hierarchical task network planning framework that enables agents to efficiently replan and reconfigure their tasks in response to environment changes. Our approach leverages a hierarchical decomposition of tasks into smaller sub-tasks, allowing agents to focus on the most critical tasks while maintaining flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances. Experimental results in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing agent response times.
