Neural ranking models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, but they often struggle with query drift and limited training data. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'PRF-NeuRank', which leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to adaptively refine the query representation. By incorporating a neural-based relevance scoring function, PRF-NeuRank effectively identifies relevant terms and documents, leading to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on the TREC Deep Learning Track dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming existing query expansion methods and showcasing its potential in real-world search applications.
