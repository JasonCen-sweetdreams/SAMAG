In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that involves assigning tasks to agents with varying capabilities. This paper proposes a novel approach to adaptive task allocation using reinforcement learning. Our method, called MARL-TA, leverages the strengths of deep Q-networks to learn an optimal task allocation policy that adapts to changing agent capabilities and task requirements. We evaluate MARL-TA on a simulated logistics scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in overall system performance and robustness compared to existing heuristics. Furthermore, we provide insights into the learned policy and discuss its applicability to real-world scenarios.
