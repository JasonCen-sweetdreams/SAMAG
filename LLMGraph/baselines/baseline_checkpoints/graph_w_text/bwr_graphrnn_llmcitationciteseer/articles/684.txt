This paper addresses the challenge of efficient retrieval in dynamic document collections, where the document set and relevance judgments are subject to frequent updates. We propose an adaptive re-ranking framework, ADR, which combines a neural ranking model with a novel online learning mechanism. ADR incrementally updates the ranking model based on user feedback and document additions/removals, without requiring periodic re-indexing or model retraining. Our experiments on a large-scale news dataset demonstrate that ADR achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency, especially in scenarios with high document churn rates.
