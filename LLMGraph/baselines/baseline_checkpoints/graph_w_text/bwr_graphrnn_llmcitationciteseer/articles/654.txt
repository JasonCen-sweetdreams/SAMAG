Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a participatory design approach to improve the accessibility of voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted co-design workshops with 15 older adults to identify pain points and elicit design requirements. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and concise voice prompts, personalized feedback mechanisms, and intuitive error recovery strategies. We propose a set of design guidelines and demonstrate their feasibility through a prototype implementation. Our approach has implications for the development of more inclusive and supportive voice assistants that can empower older adults in their daily lives.
