Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges in interacting with computers. This paper presents EyeGazeType, a novel gaze-based text entry system that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to enable efficient and accurate typing. EyeGazeType uses a convolutional neural network to detect and classify gaze patterns, allowing users to type at a rate of 15 words per minute with an accuracy of 95%. We evaluate EyeGazeType with 20 participants with motor impairments and demonstrate significant improvements in typing speed and accuracy compared to existing gaze-based systems.
