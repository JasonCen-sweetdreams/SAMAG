Traditional query expansion techniques struggle with heterogeneous document collections, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively incorporate relevant terms from the collection into the query representation. We show that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepQE in handling out-of-vocabulary queries and documents with varying semantic complexity.
