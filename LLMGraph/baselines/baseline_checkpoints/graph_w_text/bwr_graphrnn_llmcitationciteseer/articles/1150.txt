Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task with numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. While deep learning models have shown promising results, they often lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root cause of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that leverages both local and global patterns in time series data to detect anomalies. We introduce a novel attention mechanism that highlights the most relevant features and time steps contributing to the anomaly score. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of HAN compared to state-of-the-art methods, while providing insightful explanations for the detected anomalies.
