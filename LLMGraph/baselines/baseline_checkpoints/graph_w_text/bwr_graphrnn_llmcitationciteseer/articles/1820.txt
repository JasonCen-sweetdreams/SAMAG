The increasing scale and complexity of distributed database systems necessitate efficient query optimization techniques to minimize response times and improve system throughput. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and dynamic plan refinement. We introduce a cost-sensitive neural network that predicts query execution times based on historical workload patterns and system resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that our approach reduces average query response times by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
