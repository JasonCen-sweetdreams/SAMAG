This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems for real-time traffic management using reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'TRAFFIC-RL', where autonomous agents learn to optimize traffic signal control policies in a distributed manner. Our approach leverages graph neural networks to model traffic network topology and incorporates real-time traffic data to adapt to changing traffic conditions. Experimental results on a large-scale traffic simulation platform demonstrate that TRAFFIC-RL outperforms traditional traffic signal control methods, reducing congestion and travel times by up to 25%.
