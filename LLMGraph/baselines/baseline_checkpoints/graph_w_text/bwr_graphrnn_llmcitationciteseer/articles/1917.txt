Accurate real-time traffic prediction is crucial for intelligent transportation systems. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global traffic patterns to predict traffic flow. HGAT consists of a hierarchical graph encoder that captures traffic dynamics at different spatial and temporal scales, and an attention-based fusion module that adaptively combines the encoded features. Experiments on a large-scale traffic dataset show that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time traffic management applications.
