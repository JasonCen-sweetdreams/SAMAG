The increasing adoption of RDF graph databases in data-intensive applications has created a need for efficient query optimization techniques. This paper presents a novel approach, 'RDF-QOpt', which leverages graph decomposition and parallel processing to optimize SPARQL queries in distributed RDF settings. We propose a cost-based optimization framework that incorporates query rewriting, predicate reordering, and join optimization, achieving significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate RDF-QOpt's ability to reduce query execution time by up to 70% while maintaining result accuracy.
