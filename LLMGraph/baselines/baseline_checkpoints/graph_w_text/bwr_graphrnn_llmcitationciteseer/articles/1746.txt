Microblog search engines face the challenge of retrieving relevant information from a vast, noisy, and dynamic dataset. Recent advances in neural query expansion have shown promise in improving retrieval efficiency. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion framework, 'NQE-Micro', which leverages a multi-task learning approach to jointly learn query expansion and ranking functions. Our experiments on a large-scale microblog dataset demonstrate that NQE-Micro outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and accuracy, while reducing the computational overhead of traditional query expansion techniques.
