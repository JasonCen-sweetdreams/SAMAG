Augmented reality (AR) technology has the potential to revolutionize the way people with visual impairments interact with their environment. However, existing AR interfaces are often inaccessible to this population due to their reliance on visual cues. This paper presents the results of a user-centered design study aimed at creating accessible AR interfaces for users with visual impairments. We identify key design principles and guidelines for tactile and audio-based AR interactions, and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach through a series of usability studies. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating accessibility considerations into the early stages of AR interface design.
