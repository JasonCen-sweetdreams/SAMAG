Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it directly impacts the relevance and ranking of retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework, 'RL-EXPAND', that learns to optimize query expansion for complex IR tasks. RL-EXPAND incorporates a reward function that balances precision, recall, and query term importance, and utilizes a deep Q-network to select the most informative expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC-COVID dataset demonstrate that RL-EXPAND outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in both precision and recall.
