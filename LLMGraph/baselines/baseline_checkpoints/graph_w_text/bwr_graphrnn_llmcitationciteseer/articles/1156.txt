This study explores the application of embodied cognition principles to the design of gesture-based interfaces for older adults. We conducted a user study with 30 participants aged 65-75, examining how gestures that mimic real-world actions can improve cognitive load and user experience in a smart home control system. Our results show that embodied cognition-based gestures reduce error rates by 35% and increase user satisfaction compared to traditional gesture sets. We discuss implications for designing inclusive and accessible interfaces that leverage the cognitive benefits of embodied cognition.
