Query expansion is a crucial component in patent retrieval systems, as it aims to augment the original query with relevant terms to improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep learning-based semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between terms. We design a neural network architecture that incorporates patent-specific knowledge graphs and fine-tunes pre-trained language models to generate dense vector representations of terms. Experimental results on a large patent corpus demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision.
