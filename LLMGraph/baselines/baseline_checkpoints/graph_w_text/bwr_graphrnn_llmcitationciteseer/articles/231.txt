Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for timely business decision-making. However, optimizing queries for column-store databases remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'RTOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and a genetic algorithm for efficient query plan generation. Our experiments on a large-scale column-store database demonstrate that RTOpt achieves an average query speedup of 3.5x compared to traditional query optimizers, while also reducing memory usage by 25%. We also discuss the applicability of RTOpt to various data warehousing use cases.
