This paper proposes a novel decentralized multi-agent planning framework that addresses the challenges of incomplete information and partial observability in complex systems. Our approach leverages hierarchical graph attention to reason about the relationships between agents and their local observations. We develop a distributed planning algorithm that iteratively refines the joint plan by propagating and aggregating information across the agent network. Experimental results on a set of benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving near-optimal solutions while reducing communication overhead.
