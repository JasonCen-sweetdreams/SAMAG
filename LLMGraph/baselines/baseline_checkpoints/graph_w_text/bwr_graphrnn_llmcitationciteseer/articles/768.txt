Recommender systems have become increasingly reliant on complex models, often sacrificing interpretability for improved performance. This paper proposes a novel knowledge graph embedding approach, 'KEGRA', which leverages attention mechanisms to incorporate domain-specific knowledge into recommendation models. By learning to attend to relevant entities and relationships in the knowledge graph, KEGRA provides transparent and explainable recommendations. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of KEGRA in improving recommendation accuracy while enabling model interpretability.
