Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents from a large corpus. We propose a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HNR, which leverages both semantic and syntactic features to rank passages. HNR consists of a sentence encoder, a passage encoder, and a hierarchical ranking module that jointly learns to optimize the ranking of passages. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset show that HNR outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods, achieving a 15% improvement in top-1 accuracy while reducing computation time by 30%
