Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between massive amounts of data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge, particularly in distributed environments. This paper presents 'GraphOpt', a novel distributed query optimization framework designed for large-scale graph databases. GraphOpt leverages graph partitioning, parallel query execution, and adaptive join ordering to minimize query latency and reduce resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
