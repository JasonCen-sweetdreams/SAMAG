Distributed search engines face significant challenges in efficiently indexing large document collections and expanding user queries in real-time. This paper presents a novel document indexing approach, called 'Dexi', which leverages a hierarchical graph-based data structure to facilitate fast and accurate query expansion. Dexi utilizes a distributed clustering algorithm to group semantically similar documents, enabling efficient query routing and reduction of network latency. Our experiments on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that Dexi outperforms existing indexing techniques in terms of query response time and relevance, while maintaining a comparable storage overhead.
