Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their accessibility and usability for older adults remain understudied. This paper presents a participatory study involving 20 older adults (65+ years) in the co-design of an inclusive voice assistant. We employed a mixed-methods approach, combining surveys, interviews, and usability testing to identify key accessibility barriers and design recommendations. Our findings highlight the importance of customization options, clear feedback mechanisms, and consideration of age-related cognitive and sensory changes. We propose a set of guidelines for designing voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults, promoting digital inclusion and independent living.
