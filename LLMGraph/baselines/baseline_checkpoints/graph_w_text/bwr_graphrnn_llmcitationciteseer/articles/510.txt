Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it can significantly improve the retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback and deep neural networks. Our method uses a BERT-based neural ranking model to generate a set of pseudo-relevant documents, which are then used to extract expansion terms. We evaluate our approach on several standard TREC datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art query expansion methods, including RM3 and SCOPE. Our results show that the proposed approach can achieve up to 25% improvement in mean average precision over the baseline.
