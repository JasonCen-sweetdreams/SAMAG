Urban traffic management is a complex problem that requires efficient coordination among multiple agents. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize the behavior of autonomous vehicles in a multi-agent system. Our framework, 'TrafficMaestro', uses a decentralized deep Q-network to learn adaptive control policies for each agent, taking into account real-time traffic conditions and communication constraints. Simulation results on a realistic urban traffic scenario demonstrate that TrafficMaestro outperforms traditional traffic signal control methods, reducing congestion and travel times by up to 30%.
