Virtual reality (VR) systems have the potential to improve accessibility for individuals with disabilities. However, existing interaction techniques often rely on manual input, which can be challenging or impossible for users with motor impairments. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interaction framework, 'GazeVR', which leverages eye-tracking technology to enable intuitive and hands-free interaction in VR environments. We evaluate the performance of GazeVR in a series of user studies, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction for participants with motor disabilities.
