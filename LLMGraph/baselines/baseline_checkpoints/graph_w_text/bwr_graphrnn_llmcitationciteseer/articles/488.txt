In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'RL-TA', which leverages reinforcement learning to allocate tasks to heterogeneous agents. RL-TA uses a decentralized, model-free approach to learn the optimal task allocation policy, taking into account agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. We evaluate RL-TA on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional, centralized allocation methods.
