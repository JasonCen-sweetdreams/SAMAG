Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is a popular technique for dimensionality reduction in information retrieval. However, traditional LSI methods often suffer from high computational costs and mediocre retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel query-driven LSI approach, 'QDL', which leverages the query context to adaptively select the most informative latent dimensions. By incorporating a sparse coding scheme and a query-dependent weighting strategy, QDL achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QDL outperforms state-of-the-art LSI variants, especially for short queries and high-dimensional document collections.
