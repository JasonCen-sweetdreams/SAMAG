Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but its computational cost can be prohibitive for large-scale document collections. This paper proposes a neural query expansion approach that leverages a deep learning-based ranking model to generate context-aware query expansions. Our approach, 'NeuroQE', learns to identify informative query terms and expand them with relevant synonyms, hypernyms, and related entities. We evaluate NeuroQE on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional query expansion methods.
