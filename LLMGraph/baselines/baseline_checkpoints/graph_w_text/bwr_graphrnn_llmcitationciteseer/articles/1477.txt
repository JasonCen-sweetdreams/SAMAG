Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an accessible voice assistant, 'EASE', tailored to the needs of this demographic. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify key design requirements. EASE incorporates features such as simplified language processing, personalized feedback, and multimodal interaction. Our evaluation results show that EASE significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing commercial voice assistants.
