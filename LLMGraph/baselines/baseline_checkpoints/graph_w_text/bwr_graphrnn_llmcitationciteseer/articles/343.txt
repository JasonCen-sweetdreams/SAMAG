Time-series data is increasingly prevalent in various applications, from IoT sensor readings to financial transactions. The sheer volume and velocity of such data pose significant challenges to traditional indexing methods, leading to poor query performance and high storage overhead. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'TSIndex', which leverages a combination of data compression, chunk-based indexing, and query optimization techniques to achieve efficient query processing and reduced storage requirements. Experimental results on real-world time-series datasets demonstrate that TSIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 3x in query response time and 5x in storage efficiency.
