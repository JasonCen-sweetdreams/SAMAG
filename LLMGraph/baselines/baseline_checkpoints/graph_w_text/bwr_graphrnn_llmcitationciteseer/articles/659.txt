Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have become increasingly popular, but query optimization remains a significant challenge, particularly in multi-tenant environments. This paper presents 'OptiMT', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning to predict query execution plans and adapts to workload changes. OptiMT incorporates a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group tenants with similar query patterns, reducing the optimization search space. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate that OptiMT achieves up to 35% improvement in query response times and 25% reduction in resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
