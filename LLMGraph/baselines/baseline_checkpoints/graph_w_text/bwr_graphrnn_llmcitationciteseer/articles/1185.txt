Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) systems have become increasingly popular for indexing large-scale document collections. However, query efficiency remains a significant challenge, particularly in systems with high node counts. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HiDIR', which partitions the document collection into a hierarchical structure of indices. We demonstrate that HiDIR reduces query latency by up to 37% compared to existing flat indexing methods, while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on a real-world DIR system show that HiDIR scales efficiently to handle large query volumes and provides improved fault tolerance.
