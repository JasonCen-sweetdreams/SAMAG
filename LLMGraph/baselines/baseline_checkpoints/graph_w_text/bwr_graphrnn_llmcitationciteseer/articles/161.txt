Conversational agents have the potential to improve the lives of older adults, but their design often neglects the needs and preferences of this demographic. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational agents for older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify key design requirements, including simplicity, clarity, and emotional support. We developed a prototype agent that incorporates these requirements and evaluated its usability and acceptability with 30 older adults. Results show significant improvements in user experience and engagement compared to existing agents. Our findings have implications for the design of accessible and supportive conversational agents in healthcare and beyond.
