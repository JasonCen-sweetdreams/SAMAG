This paper explores the role of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in enhancing social presence and trust among older adults. We designed and evaluated an ECA system, 'ElderCare', which incorporates multimodal cues, such as gaze, gesture, and prosody, to simulate human-like interactions. Our user study with 30 older adults revealed that ElderCare increased feelings of social presence and trust compared to a text-based interface. We also identified design implications for ECAs to effectively support older adults, including the need for clear and concise communication, personalized engagement, and adaptability to individual cognitive and physical abilities.
