Individuals with dysarthria often face significant barriers when interacting with voice-based interfaces due to speech recognition errors. This paper presents 'AssistVoice', a novel framework that leverages speech therapy principles to adapt voice interfaces for users with dysarthria. We propose a set of acoustic and prosody-based features to detect and accommodate user-specific speech patterns, and develop a personalized error correction mechanism. Our user study with 20 participants with dysarthria shows that AssistVoice significantly improves speech recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
