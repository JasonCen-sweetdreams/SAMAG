Optimizing query execution is crucial for efficient data retrieval in modern database systems. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages neural networks to optimize query plans for multi-dimensional data. Our framework, 'NeuroOpt', learns to predict optimal query execution plans by modeling the intricate relationships between query components, data distributions, and system resources. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that NeuroOpt outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 40% in terms of query execution time, while maintaining competitive plan quality.
