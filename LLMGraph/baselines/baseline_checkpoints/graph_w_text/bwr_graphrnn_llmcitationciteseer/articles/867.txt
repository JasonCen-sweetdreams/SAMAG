As distributed databases continue to scale, ensuring consistency and concurrency control becomes increasingly challenging. This paper presents 'MVCC-Scale', a novel multi-version concurrency control protocol that leverages a combination of timestamp-based and value-based validation to reduce contention and abort rates in distributed transactions. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that delegates validation to local nodes, reducing the load on the central coordinator. Experimental results on a 100-node cluster demonstrate that MVCC-Scale achieves up to 3x throughput improvement over existing MVCC protocols while maintaining strong consistency guarantees.
