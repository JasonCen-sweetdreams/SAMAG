Ad-hoc retrieval models often struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel query-driven document expansion approach, 'QDE', which selectively incorporates relevant contextual information from external knowledge graphs to enrich the document representation. Our experiments on the TREC benchmarks demonstrate that QDE significantly improves retrieval effectiveness, especially for queries with ambiguous or implicit intent. We also analyze the impact of QDE on various query types and provide insights into its applicability in real-world search engines.
