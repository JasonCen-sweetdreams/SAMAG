Traditional keyword extraction techniques for document retrieval often rely on manual annotation or shallow linguistics. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages hierarchical neural networks to automatically extract relevant keywords from documents. Our model, Hier KE, incorporates a document-level encoder to capture global context and a sentence-level decoder to identify local keyword patterns. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that Hier KE outperforms state-of-the-art keyword extraction methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, while reducing computational overhead.
