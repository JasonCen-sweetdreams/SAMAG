Multi-tenancy has become a dominant architecture for cloud-based database systems, where multiple independent tenants share a common infrastructure. However, query optimization in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'MTQO', which leverages a combination of static and dynamic analysis to optimize query plans for multiple tenants. Our approach incorporates a tenant-aware cost model, a scalable optimization algorithm, and a runtime adaptation mechanism to handle diverse workload patterns. Experimental results on a commercial database system show that MTQO reduces average query latency by up to 35% and improves system throughput by up to 20% compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques.
