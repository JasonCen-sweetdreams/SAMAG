Efficient task allocation is crucial for autonomous vehicles operating in complex environments. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARTA', which enables distributed task allocation among autonomous vehicles. MARTA leverages graph neural networks to represent the spatial relationships between vehicles and tasks, and employs a decentralized Q-learning approach to optimize task assignments. We evaluate MARTA on a realistic simulation platform, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
