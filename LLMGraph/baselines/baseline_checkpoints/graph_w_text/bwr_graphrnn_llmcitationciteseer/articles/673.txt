Multi-tenant database systems (MTDS) have become increasingly popular in cloud computing, but optimizing query performance for multiple tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans based on runtime statistics and tenant-specific workloads. Our experiments on a real-world MTDS dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization, while adapting to changing workload patterns.
