Distributed database systems often struggle with query optimization due to inaccurate data distribution estimates. This paper introduces 'AdaptHist', a novel adaptive histogram approach that dynamically updates data distribution statistics based on query feedback. We present a probabilistic model that captures the uncertainty in data distribution and adaptively refines histogram buckets to minimize query errors. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database setup demonstrate that AdaptHist achieves up to 30% improvement in query performance and 25% reduction in query latency compared to traditional histogram-based approaches.
