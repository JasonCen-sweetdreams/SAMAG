Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their lack of cultural sensitivity and emotional intelligence can lead to frustrating and alienating user experiences. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive voice assistants that acknowledges the diversity of users' cultural backgrounds and emotional needs. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving surveys, interviews, and usability testing to identify key factors influencing users' trust and satisfaction with voice assistants. Our findings suggest that incorporating cultural sensitivity and emotional intelligence into voice assistant design can significantly improve user experience and foster more inclusive human-computer interaction.
