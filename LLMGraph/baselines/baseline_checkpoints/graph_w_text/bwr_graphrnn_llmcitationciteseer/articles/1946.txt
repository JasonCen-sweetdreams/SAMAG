Autonomous multi-agent systems (AMAS) rely on trust among agents to achieve collaborative goals. However, trust management in decentralized AMAS is challenging due to the lack of a centralized authority. This paper proposes a blockchain-based decentralized trust management framework, 'TrustChain', which enables agents to establish and update trust relationships in a secure and transparent manner. We design a novel consensus protocol that integrates reputation systems and game-theoretic incentives to ensure trust consistency across the network. Experimental results demonstrate that TrustChain outperforms traditional centralized trust management approaches in terms of robustness and scalability.
