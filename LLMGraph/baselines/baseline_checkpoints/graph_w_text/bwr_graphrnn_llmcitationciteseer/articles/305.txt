Data warehouses rely on materialized views to accelerate query performance, but maintaining these views in the presence of frequent data updates is a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to incremental view maintenance, dubbed 'IVM-Scale', which exploits the properties of hierarchical data structures to minimize the overhead of view updates. We introduce a caching mechanism that selectively materializes intermediate results, reducing the number of necessary recomputations. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that IVM-Scale achieves an average speedup of 3.2x over traditional incremental view maintenance techniques, while scaling to large datasets.
