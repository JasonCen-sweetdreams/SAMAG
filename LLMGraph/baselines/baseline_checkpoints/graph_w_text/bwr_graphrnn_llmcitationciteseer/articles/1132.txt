Image retrieval has become a fundamental task in computer vision, but existing methods suffer from high computational costs and memory requirements. This paper introduces a novel approach, Proximal Hashing with Neural Codes (PHNC), which leverages the strengths of hashing and neural networks to achieve efficient and accurate image retrieval. PHNC uses a proximal optimization algorithm to learn compact binary codes that preserve semantic information, and a neural network to refine the hashing process. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that PHNC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and query speed.
