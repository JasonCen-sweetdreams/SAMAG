Explainable recommendation systems are crucial for building trust in AI-driven decision-making. We propose a novel hierarchical attention graph neural network (HAGN) model that incorporates both user-item interactions and item relationships. HAGN leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant item features and relationships, generating personalized explanations for each recommendation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGN outperforms state-of-the-art models in both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
