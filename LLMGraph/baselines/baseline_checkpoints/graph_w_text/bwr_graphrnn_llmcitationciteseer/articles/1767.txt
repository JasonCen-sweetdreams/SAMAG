Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) enables organizations to make timely business decisions by analyzing fresh data. However, RTDW systems face the challenge of optimizing complex queries under tight latency constraints. This paper presents 'RapidQuery', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning to predict query execution times and identify optimal query plans. We propose a hybrid approach that combines traditional query optimization techniques with deep learning-based cost estimation models. Experimental results on a real-world RTDW benchmark demonstrate that RapidQuery outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3.5x in terms of query latency.
