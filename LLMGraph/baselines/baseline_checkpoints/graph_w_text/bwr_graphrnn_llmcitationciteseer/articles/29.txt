Virtual reality (VR) is becoming increasingly popular, but the impact of personalization on user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effects of personalized VR experiences on user engagement, satisfaction, and cognitive load. We designed and implemented a VR platform that incorporates user profiling, adaptive difficulty adjustment, and real-time feedback. Our user study involving 120 participants shows that personalized VR experiences lead to significant improvements in user engagement and satisfaction, but also increase cognitive load. We provide insights into the design of personalized VR systems that balance user experience with cognitive demands.
