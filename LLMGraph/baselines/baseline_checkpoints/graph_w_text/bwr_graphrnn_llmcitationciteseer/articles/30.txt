Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization for column-store databases, which leverages a combination of data partitioning, index selection, and join ordering to minimize query latency. Our proposed algorithm, 'ColOpt', is shown to reduce query execution time by up to 50% compared to state-of-the-art optimizers in a real-world benchmark. We further demonstrate the applicability of ColOpt in a large-scale data warehousing environment, highlighting its potential for real-time analytics and decision-making.
