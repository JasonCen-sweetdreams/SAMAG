Entity retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, and query expansion is a crucial step to improve the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion by leveraging knowledge graph embeddings. We introduce a neural network-based model that learns to embeddings of entities and their relationships, and uses them to expand the query with relevant entities and keywords. Our approach is able to capture the semantic relationships between entities and improve the retrieval performance. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
