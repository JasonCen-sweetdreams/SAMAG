The increasing volume and velocity of time-series data generated by IoT devices and sensors have posed significant challenges for efficient storage and querying in distributed databases. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, called TS-Tree, which leverages a combination of hierarchical clustering and compact bitmap representations to reduce storage overhead and improve query performance. Our experiments on a large-scale sensor dataset demonstrate that TS-Tree outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 30% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of storage efficiency.
