Short-text document collections pose significant challenges for information retrieval systems due to the limited context and sparse term frequencies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages both local and global context to improve the retrieval performance. Our method first identifies topic-specific query aspects and then expands them using a weighted combination of term embeddings and graph-based centrality measures. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, especially for short-text queries.
