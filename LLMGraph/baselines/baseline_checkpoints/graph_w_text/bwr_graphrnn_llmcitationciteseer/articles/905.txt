This paper presents a Wizard-of-Oz study examining the design of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) for older adults. We investigated the impact of agent embodiment, dialogue style, and feedback mechanisms on user experience and perceived trust. Our results show that older adults prefer agents with human-like embodiment and empathetic dialogue, and that explicit feedback mechanisms can improve user engagement. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of ECAs in healthcare and social isolation interventions, highlighting the need for user-centered approaches that accommodate the unique needs and preferences of older adults.
