As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience is crucial. This study investigates the effects of haptic feedback on user engagement, presence, and task performance in VR interfaces. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, using a custom-built VR platform with varying levels of haptic feedback. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user experience, particularly in terms of presence and task accuracy, but also increases cognitive load. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of haptic-enabled VR interfaces and identify avenues for future research.
