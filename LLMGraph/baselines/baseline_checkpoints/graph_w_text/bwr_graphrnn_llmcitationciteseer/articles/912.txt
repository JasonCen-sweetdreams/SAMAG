Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must cooperate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph attention networks (GATs) to learn effective task allocation strategies. We model the agent-agent interactions as a graph and use GATs to learn attention weights that capture the strengths of relationships between agents. Our approach, dubbed 'GraphTask', outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simulations of autonomous agents performing tasks in a warehouse management scenario. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of GraphTask and demonstrate its applicability to real-world scenarios.
