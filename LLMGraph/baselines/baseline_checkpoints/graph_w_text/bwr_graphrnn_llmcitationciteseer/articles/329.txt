Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the lives of users with motor impairments, but current systems often fail to account for the diverse range of abilities and needs within this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for developing accessible gesture recognition systems, incorporating feedback from users with motor impairments and experts in accessibility. We introduce a novel gesture recognition framework that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to accommodate varying levels of motor function. Our system is evaluated through a series of user studies, demonstrating improved recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to existing systems.
