Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, as it helps to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'NeuroXpand', which learns to generate high-quality expansion terms from a large corpus of text data. NeuroXpand leverages a combination of word embeddings and attention mechanisms to identify relevant context and relationships between terms, outperforming traditional methods based on pseudo-relevance feedback and document clustering. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
