Autonomous vehicles require advanced control strategies to navigate complex, dynamic environments. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for autonomous vehicle control, comprising a high-level policy for scenario recognition and a low-level policy for trajectory planning. We introduce a novel temporal attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant sensory inputs and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results in simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate improved control stability and adaptability compared to flat, non-hierarchical reinforcement learning approaches.
