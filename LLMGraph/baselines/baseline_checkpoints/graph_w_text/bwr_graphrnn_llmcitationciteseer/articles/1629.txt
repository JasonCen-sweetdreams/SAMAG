With the rapid growth of big data, query optimization has become a critical component of data analytics pipelines. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics and rules-based approaches, which can be suboptimal and inflexible. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RL-QOpt', that leverages reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query plan from past query executions. We design a reward function that balances query performance, resource utilization, and data freshness, and demonstrate that RL-QOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques on a range of big data benchmarks.
