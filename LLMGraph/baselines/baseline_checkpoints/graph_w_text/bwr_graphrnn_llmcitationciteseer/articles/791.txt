Diversified search systems aim to provide users with a variety of relevant results, rather than a list of similar documents. Query reformulation is a common technique used to improve the diversification of search results. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the impact of query reformulation on diversified search results. We propose a novel framework that incorporates multiple query reformulation strategies and evaluates their effects on search result diversification. Our experiments on a large-scale web corpus show that our approach significantly improves the diversity of search results, while also enhancing the overall relevance of the retrieved documents.
