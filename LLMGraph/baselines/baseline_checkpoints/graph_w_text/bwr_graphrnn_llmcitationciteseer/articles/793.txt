In multi-agent systems, planning and coordination are crucial for achieving complex tasks. However, the lack of transparency in agent decision-making hinders trust and understanding among agents and humans. This paper presents HTN-X, a novel hierarchical task network framework that incorporates explainability mechanisms into multi-agent planning. HTN-X leverages model-based reasoning to generate hierarchical plans, and then applies model-agnostic explanations to provide insights into agent decision-making. Experimental results on a variety of multi-agent scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of HTN-X in improving plan explainability and agent coordination.
