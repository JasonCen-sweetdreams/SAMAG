Few-shot node classification in graph-structured data remains a challenging task, particularly when dealing with limited labeled instances. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) architecture that leverages both node and graph-level attention mechanisms to adaptively focus on relevant subgraphs and node features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in few-shot node classification tasks. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of the attention patterns learned by HAGNN, offering insights into the underlying graph structure and feature importance.
