Autonomous multi-agent systems rely on trust relationships between agents to ensure coordination and cooperation. However, managing trust in decentralized settings is challenging due to the lack of central authority and limited communication. This paper proposes a novel decentralized trust management framework, 'TrustNet', which leverages blockchain and distributed ledger technology to establish and update trust relationships between agents. We introduce a reputation-based trust model that incorporates both direct and indirect trust evidence, and demonstrate its effectiveness in simulated scenarios of cooperative robotics and smart grids. TrustNet provides a scalable and resilient solution for trust management in autonomous multi-agent systems.
