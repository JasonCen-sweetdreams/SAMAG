Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize therapy, education, and entertainment for individuals with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR interfaces often exacerbate cognitive load, leading to user frustration and abandonment. This paper presents 'CogVR', a novel VR interface design framework that incorporates evidence-based cognitive support strategies, such as simplified navigation, error forgiveness, and visual cueing. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with cognitive impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates, user satisfaction, and cognitive workload reduction. Our findings inform the development of more inclusive and accessible VR experiences.
