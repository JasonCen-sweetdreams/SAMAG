We address the problem of task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to coordinate to accomplish multiple tasks. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that utilizes stochastic optimization to efficiently allocate tasks to agents. Our approach combines a distributed consensus protocol with a probabilistic task assignment strategy, enabling agents to adapt to changing task requirements and agent availability. Experimental results demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing centralized and distributed task allocation methods.
