Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, but existing methods often rely on simplistic term weighting schemes or require extensive manual tuning. This paper proposes a novel context-aware embedding approach, 'CAQE', which leverages semantic relationships between query terms and their surrounding context to generate more informative expansion terms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CAQE on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art expansion techniques. Our approach is also shown to be more efficient and scalable, making it suitable for real-world search applications.
