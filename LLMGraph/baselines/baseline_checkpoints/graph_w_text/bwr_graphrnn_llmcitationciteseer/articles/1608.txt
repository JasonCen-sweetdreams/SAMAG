Autonomous systems, such as robot swarms and smart grids, rely on efficient multi-agent coordination to achieve complex tasks. Graph attention networks (GATs) have shown promise in modeling agent interactions, but their computational complexity hinders real-time applications. This paper proposes a novel, hierarchical GAT architecture that leverages agent clustering and sparse attention mechanisms to reduce computational overhead while preserving coordination performance. Experimental results on a simulated drone swarm demonstrate that our approach achieves a 3x speedup over existing GAT-based methods while maintaining comparable coordination quality.
