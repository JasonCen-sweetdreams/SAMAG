Deep learning-based recommenders have achieved remarkable success, but their opacity hinders user trust and limits their applicability. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HiGAT) that incorporates both item and user graph structures to generate personalized recommendations. HiGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant items and users, enabling interpretable recommendations. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that HiGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing transparent and explainable results.
