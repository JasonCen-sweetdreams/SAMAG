Anomaly detection in time-series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in this area, they often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) architecture that leverages a hierarchical graph representation to reduce the computational complexity of anomaly detection. Our approach combines a local graph attention mechanism with a global graph pooling strategy to identify anomalies in time-series data. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
