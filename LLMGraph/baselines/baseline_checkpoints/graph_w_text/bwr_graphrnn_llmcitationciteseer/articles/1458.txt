Passage retrieval is a critical component in many information retrieval systems, where the goal is to retrieve the most relevant passages from a large document collection given a query. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network-based approach for document re-ranking, which leverages the semantic relationships between passages and the query. Our model, called DPRank, uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture the contextual information in passages and computes a ranking score based on the semantic similarity with the query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DPRank outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
