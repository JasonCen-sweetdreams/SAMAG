With the increasing prevalence of multi-modal data, conventional query optimization techniques are no longer effective in handling complex queries. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MMO', which leverages machine learning and graph-based methods to efficiently process queries in multi-modal database systems. MMO incorporates a hybrid cost model that combines estimates of CPU, I/O, and memory usage to accurately predict query execution times. Experimental results on a real-world multi-modal dataset demonstrate that MMO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
