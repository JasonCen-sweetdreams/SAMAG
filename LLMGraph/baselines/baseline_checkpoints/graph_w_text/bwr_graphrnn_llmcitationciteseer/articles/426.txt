Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper proposes a novel deep hierarchical clustering approach, dubbed 'DeepHiClu', for unsupervised anomaly detection in such data. DeepHiClu leverages a multi-scale temporal encoder to extract robust representations of the time series data, and a hierarchical clustering module to identify anomalies at multiple granularity levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepHiClu on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
