Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but individuals with speech disabilities face significant barriers in using these systems. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive voice-based interfaces, focusing on users with dysarthria. We propose a participatory design approach, involving users with dysarthria in the design process to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our framework incorporates a range of techniques, including speech recognition adaptation, personalized acoustic modeling, and multimodal feedback. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in interaction accuracy and user satisfaction, highlighting the potential of our approach to promote greater accessibility and inclusion.
