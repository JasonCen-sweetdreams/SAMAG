In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is a crucial task that involves grouping agents to achieve common goals. However, the dynamic nature of real-world environments and the need for adaptability in coalition structures pose significant challenges. This paper presents a novel framework, 'DeepCoal', that leverages deep graph reinforcement learning to enable adaptive coalition formation. Our approach represents the agent interaction graph as a dynamic graph neural network, which learns to predict coalition values and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DeepCoal outperforms traditional graph-based coalition formation methods, achieving higher coalition values and faster adaptation to changing circumstances.
