Real-time data stream processing has become a critical component of modern data infrastructure, but optimizing query execution plans for dynamic data streams remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for real-time data streams. Our method, called 'StreamOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the current query workload, data distribution, and system resources. We evaluate StreamOpt on a range of real-world datasets and demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional query optimization techniques.
