This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'QRank', that leverages query-document interaction to improve the accuracy and efficiency of document ranking in information retrieval. QRank employs a deep neural network to learn a dense representation of queries and documents, and incorporates a novel attention mechanism to capture their interaction. We conduct experiments on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that QRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision and mean reciprocal rank. We also analyze the computational efficiency of QRank and show that it can be effectively deployed in real-world search engines.
