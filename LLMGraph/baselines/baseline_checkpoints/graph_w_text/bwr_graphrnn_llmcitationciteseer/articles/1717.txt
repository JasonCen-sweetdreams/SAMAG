Conversational agents have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often overlooks the needs of people with disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for creating inclusive conversational agents that accommodate diverse abilities. We conducted a large-scale user study with participants from various disability groups, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed framework incorporates multimodal interaction, personalized adaptation, and accessible feedback mechanisms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a prototype chatbot, 'Empathy', which significantly improves user engagement and satisfaction for users with disabilities.
