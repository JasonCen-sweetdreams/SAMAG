Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture user intent, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel unsupervised query expansion approach that leverages hierarchical document representation to better model query-document relationships. Our method, called HiQE, represents documents as hierarchical graphs, which enables the capture of nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and document content. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that HiQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving an average improvement of 15% in mean average precision.
