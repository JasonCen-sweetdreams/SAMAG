The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources in smart grids necessitates adaptive resource allocation strategies to ensure efficient and reliable power distribution. This paper proposes a novel approach to agent negotiation for dynamic resource allocation, incorporating machine learning and game theory. Our approach, 'AANA', employs a decentralized architecture where agents representing different stakeholders in the grid negotiate resource allocation based on real-time supply and demand data. AANA adapts to changing grid conditions through reinforcement learning and minimizes energy waste and costs. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid environment demonstrate the effectiveness of AANA in reducing energy losses and improving grid stability.
