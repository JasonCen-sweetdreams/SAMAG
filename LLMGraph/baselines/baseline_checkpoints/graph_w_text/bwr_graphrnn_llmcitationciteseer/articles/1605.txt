Optimizing query execution plans is crucial in distributed relational databases. Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in learning complex patterns in graph-structured data. We propose a novel approach, 'GNN-Opt', that leverages GNNs to learn a query optimization model from a database's query logs and schema. Our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques, such as dynamic programming and rule-based optimization, in terms of query latency and resource utilization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GNN-Opt on a real-world distributed database, achieving an average speedup of 2.5x over existing optimization methods.
