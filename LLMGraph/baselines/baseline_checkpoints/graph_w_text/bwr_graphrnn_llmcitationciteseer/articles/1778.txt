As real-time analytics becomes increasingly important in modern data-driven applications, distributed column-store databases must optimize query performance to keep up with the growing volume and velocity of data. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to predict query execution times and optimize query plans in real-time. We propose a cost-based optimization approach that incorporates data distribution, query patterns, and system resource utilization to minimize query latency. Experimental results on a large-scale benchmark dataset demonstrate that ColOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query throughput and latency.
