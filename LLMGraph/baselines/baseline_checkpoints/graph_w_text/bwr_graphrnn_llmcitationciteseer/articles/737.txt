Traditional neural ranking models for document retrieval often suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HiRank', which leverages a tree-based architecture to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. HiRank combines a coarse-grained relevance scorer with a fine-grained ranking module, allowing for a significant reduction in computational overhead while maintaining retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HiRank over state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of retrieval accuracy and query processing time.
