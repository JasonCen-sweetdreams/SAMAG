Distributed databases have become a cornerstone of modern data management, but optimizing query execution plans remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to scalable query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our method, 'QOptRL', leverages a hierarchical DRL framework to learn query optimization policies that adapt to diverse workload patterns and database configurations. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database testbed demonstrate that QOptRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average query response time reduction of 35% and improved resource utilization.
