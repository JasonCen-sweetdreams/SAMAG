Main-memory databases have revolutionized data processing, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization, 'Memoize', which leverages multi-dimensional indexing to minimize query execution times. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that adaptively selects the most efficient indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distributions. Experimental results on a real-world benchmark dataset demonstrate that Memoize reduces query latency by up to 3x compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques, while maintaining high throughput.
