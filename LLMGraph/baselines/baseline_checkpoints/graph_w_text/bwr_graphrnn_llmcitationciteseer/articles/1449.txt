The proliferation of large-scale RDF (Resource Description Framework) graphs has led to significant challenges in query optimization for cloud-based storage systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RDF-QO', which leverages graph partitioning, parallel query execution, and adaptive indexing to improve query performance and scalability. We introduce a cost-based optimization model that minimizes data transfer and processing costs, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real-world RDF dataset. Experimental results show that RDF-QO achieves up to 5x speedup over existing query optimization techniques for large-scale RDF graphs.
