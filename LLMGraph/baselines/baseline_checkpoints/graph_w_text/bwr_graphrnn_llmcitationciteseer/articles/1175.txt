This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using auction-based mechanisms. We propose a novel auction protocol that considers the agents' diverse capabilities, preferences, and communication constraints. Our approach enables efficient task allocation while promoting fairness and robustness in the system. Experimental results on a simulated urban search and rescue scenario demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing centralized and distributed task allocation methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
