Query optimization remains a crucial challenge in modern database systems, particularly for high-dimensional data. This paper presents a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HIDX', which leverages a combination of clustering and space-filling curves to efficiently prune the search space. We demonstrate that HIDX outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques, such as R-trees and quad trees, on a range of real-world datasets, achieving up to 3x speedup in query response times. Additionally, our approach is shown to be robust against data skew and variability, making it suitable for large-scale database applications.
