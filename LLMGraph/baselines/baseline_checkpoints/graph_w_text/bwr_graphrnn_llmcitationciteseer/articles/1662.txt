The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has created a need for efficient task allocation strategies that can adapt to dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARA', that learns to allocate tasks to IoT devices in a decentralized manner. MARA utilizes a graph neural network to model the communication topology of the IoT network and employs a decentralized actor-critic algorithm to optimize task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that MARA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and energy efficiency.
