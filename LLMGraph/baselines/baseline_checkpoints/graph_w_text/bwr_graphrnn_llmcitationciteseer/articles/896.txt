The exponential growth of digital documents necessitates efficient and effective information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a hybrid semantic indexing framework that integrates lexical, syntactic, and semantic features to facilitate fast and accurate document retrieval. We introduce a novel graph-based indexing scheme that captures document relationships and optimizes query processing. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale document collection demonstrates a significant reduction in query latency and improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
