Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component in various industries, but it poses significant challenges in maintaining data consistency and concurrency control. This paper presents a novel multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) protocol, 'RT-MVCC', designed specifically for real-time data warehousing. RT-MVCC leverages a combination of timestamp-based and serialization-based approaches to ensure high concurrency, low latency, and strong consistency guarantees. We evaluate RT-MVCC using a comprehensive simulation framework and demonstrate its superiority over existing MVCC protocols in terms of throughput, latency, and data freshness.
