In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving optimal performance. This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation using reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized algorithm, 'RL-TA', which enables agents to learn from their local interactions and adapt to changing environmental conditions. Our method leverages a graph neural network to model agent relationships and a deep Q-network to learn optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that RL-TA outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
