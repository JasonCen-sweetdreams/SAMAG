Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to revolutionize assistive technology, but existing AR systems often neglect the needs of visually impaired users. This paper presents 'Aria', an inclusive AR interface that leverages 3D audio and haptic feedback to facilitate spatial awareness and object recognition. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 20 visually impaired participants, revealing that Aria significantly improved their navigation and interaction experience compared to traditional screen-reader-based approaches. Our findings inform the design of accessible AR interfaces that can empower visually impaired individuals in various aspects of daily life.
