Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-based machine learning, but it often suffers from scalability issues and inadequate feature representation. We propose a novel hierarchical attention graph convolutional network (HAGCN) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and features. Our approach integrates graph convolutional layers with hierarchical attention to capture complex node relationships and improve classification accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and computational efficiency.
