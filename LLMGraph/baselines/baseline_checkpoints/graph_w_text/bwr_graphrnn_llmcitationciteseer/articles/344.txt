This paper investigates the development of autonomous negotiation strategies for multi-agent systems operating in dynamic environments. We propose a novel framework, 'DynaNeg', which integrates probabilistic reasoning with game-theoretic analysis to enable agents to adapt their negotiation tactics in response to changing environmental conditions. Our approach leverages Markov decision processes to model the uncertain environment and learn optimal policies for negotiation. Experimental results in a simulated supply chain management scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNeg in achieving improved negotiation outcomes and increased robustness to environmental uncertainties.
