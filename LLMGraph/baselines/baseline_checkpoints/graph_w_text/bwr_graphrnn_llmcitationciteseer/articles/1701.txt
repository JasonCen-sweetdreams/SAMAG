Current search engines often return redundant or similar results, leading to a lack of retrieval diversity. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach to address this issue. Our method leverages contextualized embeddings to identify semantically related terms and expand the original query. We then incorporate a diversification module that re-ranks the expanded document set to prioritize novelty and relevance. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval diversity and user satisfaction, particularly for ambiguous and open-domain queries.
