Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing effective user interfaces remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of personalized avatars on user experience in VR. We conducted a mixed-methods experiment with 120 participants, using a custom-built VR platform and a range of avatar customization options. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly enhance user engagement, sense of presence, and overall satisfaction. We also identify key design factors influencing these effects, including avatar facial similarity and body type congruence. The findings have important implications for the design of future VR systems and applications.
