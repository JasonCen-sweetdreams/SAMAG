The increasing scale and complexity of big data analytics necessitate efficient indexing techniques for multi-dimensional range queries. This paper presents a novel indexing approach, 'HierCube', which leverages hierarchical clustering and cube-based indexing to accelerate query processing. HierCube adaptively partitions the data space into dense and sparse regions, reducing the number of candidate points to be evaluated. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HierCube outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving up to 3x faster query performance and 2x better storage efficiency.
