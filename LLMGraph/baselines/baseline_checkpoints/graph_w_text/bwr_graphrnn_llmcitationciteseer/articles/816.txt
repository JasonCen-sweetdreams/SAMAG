Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when users submit poorly formulated queries. This paper introduces a novel query expansion approach, QERL, which leverages deep reinforcement learning to iteratively refine queries based on user feedback. Our method employs a hierarchical policy network to select relevant terms from a candidate set, simulating user interactions to optimize the retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that QERL outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% relative increase in mean average precision.
