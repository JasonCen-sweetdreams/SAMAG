Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing queries across multiple nodes remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the query plan as a graph and leverage GNNs to learn a representation of the query that captures its structural properties. Our approach, called GNN-QO, outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time and reduces the number of joins required by up to 25%. We evaluate GNN-QO on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in optimizing complex queries.
