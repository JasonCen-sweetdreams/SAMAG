Traditional document indexing methods in information retrieval (IR) rely on fixed, dense vector representations, which can be computationally expensive and may not capture the nuances of user queries. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document embedding (QADE) approach, which dynamically generates compact, sparse representations of documents based on the context and semantics of the input query. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QADE improves retrieval efficiency by up to 30% while maintaining state-of-the-art retrieval effectiveness.
