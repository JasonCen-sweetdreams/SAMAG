Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short queries. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document expansion approach, QADE, which selectively incorporates relevant terms from the top-retrieved documents to re-weight the query. Our method leverages a neural ranking model to estimate the relevance of each term and adaptively adjusts the expansion based on the query's semantic meaning. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QADE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
