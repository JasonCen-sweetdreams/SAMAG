The proliferation of large-scale document collections has exacerbated the challenge of efficient information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, HiQE, which leverages semantic relationships between query terms to improve retrieval efficiency. HiQE incorporates a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify relevant term clusters, which are then used to generate expanded queries. Our experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HiQE achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency, with an average reduction of 37% in query latency, while maintaining comparable retrieval effectiveness to state-of-the-art methods.
