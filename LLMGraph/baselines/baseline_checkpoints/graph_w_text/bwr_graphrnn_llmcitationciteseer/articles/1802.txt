Neural ranking models have shown significant improvements in document retrieval tasks, but their performance can be limited by the quality of query representations and document embeddings. This paper explores the effectiveness of query expansion techniques in conjunction with neural ranking models and proposes a novel document embedding method, 'Doc2Vec+', which incorporates both local and global contextual information. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that our approach can lead to significant improvements in ranking accuracy, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
