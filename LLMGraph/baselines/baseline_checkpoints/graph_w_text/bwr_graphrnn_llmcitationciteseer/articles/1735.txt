In multi-agent systems, cooperative task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. However, designing incentive mechanisms to encourage agents to participate and contribute to the collective goal remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel, decentralized mechanism that leverages game-theoretic principles to incentivize agents to cooperate. Our approach, called 'CoopIncent', combines a reputation system with a novel scoring function that rewards agents for their contributions to the collective goal. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that CoopIncent outperforms existing mechanisms in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
