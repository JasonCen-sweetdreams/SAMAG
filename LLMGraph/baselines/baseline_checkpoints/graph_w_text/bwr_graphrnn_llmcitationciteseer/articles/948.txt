We present a novel approach to cooperative task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities must collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. Our method leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn a task allocation policy that optimizes global performance while respecting individual agent constraints. We introduce a hierarchical graph representation that captures both inter-agent dependencies and task requirements, enabling the GCN to learn effective task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rate and overall system efficiency compared to existing allocation strategies.
