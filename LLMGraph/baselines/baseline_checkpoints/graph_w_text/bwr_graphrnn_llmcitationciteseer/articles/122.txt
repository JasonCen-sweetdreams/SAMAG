Urban traffic control is a complex problem that requires coordination among multiple agents to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to train a multi-agent system to coordinate traffic signals in real-time. Our approach, called 'TrafficMA', uses a decentralized architecture where each agent learns to adjust its signal timing based on local observations and communicates with neighboring agents to achieve global optimality. Experimental results on a simulated urban traffic network demonstrate that TrafficMA outperforms traditional methods in reducing travel times and increasing network throughput.
