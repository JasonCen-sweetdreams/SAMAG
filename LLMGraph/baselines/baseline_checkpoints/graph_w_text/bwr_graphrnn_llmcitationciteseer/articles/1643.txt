Entity retrieval is a critical task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve entities that match a given query. However, the limited query context often leads to poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a neural query expansion approach, 'NQE-ER', which leverages a transformer-based architecture to generate contextualized query expansions. We utilize a novel entity-aware training objective that incorporates both relevance and entity-relatedness signals. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that NQE-ER significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 15% relative improvement in mean average precision.
