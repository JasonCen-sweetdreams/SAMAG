As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent in industrial settings, traditional input methods are no longer sufficient. This paper presents a novel gaze-based interface, 'GazeAR', designed specifically for industrial AR applications. By leveraging eye-tracking technology and machine learning algorithms, GazeAR enables users to interact with virtual objects in a natural and intuitive manner. We evaluate the performance and usability of GazeAR in a real-world industrial scenario, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional input methods.
