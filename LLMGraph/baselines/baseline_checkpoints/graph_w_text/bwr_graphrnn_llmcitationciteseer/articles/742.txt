Semi-supervised node classification is a fundamental problem in graph-structured data, where a small portion of nodes are labeled. Existing graph neural network (GNN) models often suffer from scalability issues and fail to capture complex hierarchical relationships between nodes. This paper presents HGAN, a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network that leverages a multi-resolution graph representation to efficiently aggregate node features and attention weights. Experimental results on large-scale datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms state-of-the-art GNN models in terms of node classification accuracy and scalability.
