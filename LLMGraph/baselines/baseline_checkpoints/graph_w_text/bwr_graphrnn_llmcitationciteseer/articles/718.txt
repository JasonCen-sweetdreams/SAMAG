Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for managing large-scale data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in such systems. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines query rewriting and path indexing to optimize data retrieval in distributed database systems. We introduce a query rewriting algorithm that transforms complex queries into optimized subqueries, and a path indexing technique that accelerates query execution by reducing the number of nodes to be traversed. Experimental results on a real-world distributed dataset show that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time and 25% in terms of data transfer cost.
