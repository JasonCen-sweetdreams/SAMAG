Coordinating multiple agents in decentralized environments is a challenging problem, especially when agents have conflicting goals or limited communication. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to achieve coordination in such scenarios. We propose a decentralized actor-critic framework, where each agent learns to predict the actions of its neighbors and adjusts its policy accordingly. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized coordination methods in terms of convergence speed and solution quality.
