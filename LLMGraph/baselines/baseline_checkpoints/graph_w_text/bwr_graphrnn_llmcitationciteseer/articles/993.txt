Entity disambiguation is a critical step in search query understanding, as it resolves ambiguity in user queries and improves retrieval effectiveness. This paper presents a hybrid retrieval model, 'Hydra', that integrates entity disambiguation into the retrieval process. Hydra combines a knowledge graph-based entity disambiguator with a neural ranking model, enabling the model to capture both semantic and contextual relationships between entities. Experimental results on a large-scale search query dataset demonstrate that Hydra outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving a 12.5% improvement in NDCG@10 and a 9.2% improvement in ERR@10.
