Virtual reality (VR) has become an increasingly popular platform for immersive experiences, but designing effective feedback mechanisms remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of anthropomorphic feedback on user experience in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, randomly assigning them to either an anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic feedback condition. Results show that anthropomorphic feedback significantly improves user engagement, reduces cognitive load, and enhances overall user satisfaction. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of future VR systems and provide recommendations for incorporating anthropomorphic feedback into VR experiences.
