This paper presents a novel approach to gesture recognition that adapts to the abilities of users with motor impairments. Our system, called AdaptiveGesture, uses a machine learning model to identify the user's motor capabilities and adjusts the gesture recognition algorithm accordingly. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with varying levels of motor impairment and found that AdaptiveGesture significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional systems. Our results have implications for the design of more inclusive and accessible human-computer interfaces.
