Real-time information retrieval (IR) systems require efficient document filtering to retrieve relevant documents from a large corpus. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DeepFilter', that leverages deep neural networks to filter documents in real-time. DeepFilter uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to model the relevance of documents to a given query, and a novel indexing technique to reduce the computational overhead. Experimental results on a large-scale IR dataset demonstrate that DeepFilter outperforms traditional filtering methods in terms of precision and recall, while achieving a significant reduction in filtering time.
