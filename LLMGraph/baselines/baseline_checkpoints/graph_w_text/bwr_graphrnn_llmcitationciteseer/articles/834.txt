Main-memory databases have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics and decision-making. However, indexing mechanisms for efficient query processing remain a bottleneck. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'HyperCube', which accelerates multi-dimensional range queries by exploiting the hierarchical structure of main-memory data. HyperCube employs a hybrid approach that combines a compact, cache-friendly representation of the index with a dynamic, adaptive partitioning scheme. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate a 3-5x improvement in query performance compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods, while reducing memory footprint by up to 30%.
