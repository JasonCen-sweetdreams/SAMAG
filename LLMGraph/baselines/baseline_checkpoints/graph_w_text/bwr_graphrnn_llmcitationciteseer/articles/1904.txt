Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and network topology. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to optimize query plans based on feedback from the database system. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
