Patent search is a crucial task in intellectual property management, but the complexity and variability of patent documents make it challenging. We propose a hierarchical query expansion approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture the semantic relationships between patent concepts. Our method, called HQE-GNN, first constructs a graph of query terms and their synonyms, then applies GNNs to learn a dense representation of the query. Experimental results on a large patent dataset demonstrate that HQE-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of precision and recall, while reducing the computational cost.
