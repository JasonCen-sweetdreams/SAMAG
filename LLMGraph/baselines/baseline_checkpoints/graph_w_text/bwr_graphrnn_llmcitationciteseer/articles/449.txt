Multi-agent systems require effective decision-making strategies that balance individual goals with collective outcomes. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (H-GAT) architecture for explainable multi-agent decision-making. H-GAT combines graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical clustering to identify influential agents and their interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of H-GAT in a variety of cooperative and competitive scenarios, showcasing improved decision-making outcomes while providing interpretable insights into agent interactions. Our approach has implications for real-world applications such as autonomous vehicle coordination, smart grids, and disaster response.
