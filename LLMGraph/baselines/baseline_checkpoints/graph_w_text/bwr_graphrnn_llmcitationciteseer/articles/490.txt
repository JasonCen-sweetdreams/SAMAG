In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'AdaNeg', which leverages adaptive negotiation strategies to optimize task assignments among agents. AdaNeg incorporates a reinforcement learning-based mechanism that enables agents to adapt their negotiation policies based on dynamic system conditions and task requirements. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaNeg outperforms existing allocation algorithms in terms of task completion time, resource utilization, and system robustness.
