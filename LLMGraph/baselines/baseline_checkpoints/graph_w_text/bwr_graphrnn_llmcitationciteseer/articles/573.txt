Virtual fitness environments have become increasingly popular, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the effect of personalized avatar-based feedback on user motivation and exercise adherence. We designed a novel system, 'FitAvatar', which utilizes machine learning-based affect recognition and 3D avatar customization to provide users with realistic, personalized feedback on their exercise form and progress. A user study with 120 participants revealed that FitAvatar significantly improved user engagement, self-efficacy, and exercise adherence compared to traditional virtual fitness platforms. Our results have implications for the design of future virtual fitness systems that aim to promote long-term user engagement and behavior change.
