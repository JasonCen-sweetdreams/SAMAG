Distributed column-store databases have become increasingly popular for big data analytics, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents 'Columbo', a novel query optimization framework that leverages statistical models and machine learning techniques to improve query performance. Columbo introduces a scalable, distributed architecture for query optimization, which can handle large query workloads and adapt to changing data distributions. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that Columbo achieves an average query speedup of 3.2x compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
