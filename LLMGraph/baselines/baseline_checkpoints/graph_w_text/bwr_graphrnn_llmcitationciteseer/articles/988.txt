Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in node classification tasks, but their performance degrades significantly when labeled data is scarce. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that adaptively selects the most informative nodes and their corresponding labels to learn more effective node representations. HGAT leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism that aggregates node features at multiple scales, enabling the model to capture both local and global structural patterns. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in limited labeled data regimes.
