Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but current VR systems often pose significant accessibility barriers. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key design principles, including simplified navigation, intuitive interface design, and personalized cognitive support. Our evaluation shows that our framework improves user engagement, reduces frustration, and enhances overall VR experience quality for older adults with cognitive impairments.
