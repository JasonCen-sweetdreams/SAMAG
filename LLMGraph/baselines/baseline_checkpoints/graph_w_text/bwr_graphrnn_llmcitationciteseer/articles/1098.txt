Cloud computing platforms require efficient resource allocation to meet dynamic workload demands. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'CloudOptimizer', which learns to optimize resource allocation in real-time. Our approach combines a deep Q-network with a graph neural network to capture complex dependencies between resources and workloads. We evaluate CloudOptimizer on a large-scale cloud simulation platform and demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and energy efficiency compared to existing heuristics and model-free RL methods.
