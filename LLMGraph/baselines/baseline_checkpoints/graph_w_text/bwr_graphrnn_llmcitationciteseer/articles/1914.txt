Modern search engines often struggle to provide diversified results, leading to redundant information and poor user experience. This paper proposes a novel hybrid ranking model, 'NeuDiv', which leverages neural query graph embeddings to capture complex relationships between queries and documents. By combining the strengths of both lexical and semantic matching, NeuDiv achieves significant improvements in search result diversification while maintaining relevance. Experimental evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuDiv in reducing redundancy and enhancing user satisfaction.
