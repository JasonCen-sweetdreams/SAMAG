This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed a VR system that leverages hand-tracking technology to enable users to manipulate virtual objects using natural gestures. Our user study reveals that participants who used gestures to interact with virtual objects exhibited improved cognitive performance and enhanced sense of presence compared to those using traditional controllers. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more intuitive and engaging VR interfaces.
