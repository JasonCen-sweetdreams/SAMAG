In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and scalable solutions. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, leveraging hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize task assignment and execution. Our approach, called HRL-TA, consists of two layers: a high-level task allocation layer that uses a deep Q-network to select tasks, and a low-level execution layer that employs a policy gradient method to optimize task execution. We evaluate HRL-TA in a simulated environment with multiple agents and tasks, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized task allocation methods.
