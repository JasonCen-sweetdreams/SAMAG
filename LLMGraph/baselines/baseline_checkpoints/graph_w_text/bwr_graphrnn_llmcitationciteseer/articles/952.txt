Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the quality of search results. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query expansion, leveraging word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. We introduce a graph convolutional network that learns to represent queries and documents as nodes in a graph, enabling the integration of contextual information and semantic similarity measures. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall.
