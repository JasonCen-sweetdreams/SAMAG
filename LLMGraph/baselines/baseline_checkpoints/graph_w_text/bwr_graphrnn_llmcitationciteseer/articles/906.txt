Efficient task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and constraints need to optimize resource utilization in real-time. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'MARTA', which enables agents to learn task allocation policies that adapt to dynamic environments and resource availability. Our approach integrates graph neural networks with DRL to represent complex agent interactions and resource dependencies. Experimental results on a simulated manufacturing scenario demonstrate that MARTA outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of resource utilization, task completion time, and overall system efficiency.
