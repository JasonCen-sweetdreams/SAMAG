Specialized search engines, such as those for scholarly articles or e-commerce products, require efficient retrieval mechanisms to handle complex queries. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach, 'DQE', which leverages query expansion techniques to improve retrieval precision. DQE employs a transformer-based architecture to learn semantic relationships between query terms and expand the query with relevant keywords. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset of academic papers demonstrate that DQE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models in terms of mean average precision and recall.
