Coordinating autonomous agents in dynamic environments is a challenging problem due to the uncertainty and variability of task requirements. This paper presents a novel adaptive task allocation framework, 'ATA-E', which leverages machine learning to predict task demands and adjust agent assignments in real-time. Our approach integrates a decentralized Markov decision process (MDP) with a graph neural network (GNN) to facilitate efficient communication and coordination among agents. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that ATA-E outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate and agent utilization, while adapting to changes in the environment.
