Few-shot learning has seen significant advances with the development of meta-learning algorithms. However, these methods often rely on densely parameterized models, leading to high computational costs and memory requirements. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'Decouple', that separates the representation learning and inference stages. By leveraging a frozen feature extractor and a lightweight, task-adaptive inference module, Decouple achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular few-shot benchmarks while reducing computational overhead by up to 75%. We analyze the trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, providing insights into the design of scalable few-shot learning systems.
