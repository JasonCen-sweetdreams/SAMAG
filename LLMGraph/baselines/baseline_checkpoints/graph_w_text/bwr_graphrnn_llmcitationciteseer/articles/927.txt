Explainable AI (XAI) has become a crucial aspect of building trustworthy recommendation systems. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that integrates graph-based feature extraction with attention mechanisms to generate personalized recommendations. HGAT learns to attend to relevant user and item features, as well as their hierarchical relationships, to provide transparent and interpretable recommendations. We evaluate HGAT on three real-world datasets and demonstrate improved performance and explainability compared to state-of-the-art recommendation models. Our approach has significant implications for deploying XAI-driven recommendation systems in high-stakes applications.
