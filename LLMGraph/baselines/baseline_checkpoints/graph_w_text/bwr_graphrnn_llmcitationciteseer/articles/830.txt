Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems often struggle to capture the nuances of biomedical queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between medical concepts. Our model, MedQE, uses a combination of word embeddings and graph attention mechanisms to generate high-quality expansion terms. Experimental evaluations on the TREC CDS dataset demonstrate that MedQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
