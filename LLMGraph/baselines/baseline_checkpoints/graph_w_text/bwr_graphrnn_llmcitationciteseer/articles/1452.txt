Anomaly detection in time series data is crucial in various applications, including predictive maintenance and financial forecasting. This paper proposes a novel approach using Hierarchical Self-Organizing Maps (HSOMs) to detect anomalies in multivariate time series data. Our method leverages the strengths of SOMs in clustering and dimensionality reduction, while incorporating a hierarchical structure to handle complex patterns and anomalies. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
