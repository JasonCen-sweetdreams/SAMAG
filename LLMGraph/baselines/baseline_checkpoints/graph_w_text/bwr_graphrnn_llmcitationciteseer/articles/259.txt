With the increasing adoption of cloud-based database systems, distributed query optimization has become a critical challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to data partitioning, 'PartiQL', which leverages machine learning-based clustering techniques to identify optimal data splits. PartiQL is designed to minimize data transfer and reduce query latency in distributed query execution. We evaluate PartiQL on a real-world cloud-based database system and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to existing partitioning schemes.
