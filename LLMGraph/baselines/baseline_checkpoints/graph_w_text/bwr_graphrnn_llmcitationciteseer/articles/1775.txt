In multi-agent systems, decentralized task allocation is a challenging problem due to the need to balance individual agent objectives with global system efficiency. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to learn decentralized task allocation policies. We introduce a hierarchical framework that combines a graph neural network for agent communication with a deep Q-network for task allocation. Our approach is evaluated on a variety of simulated scenarios and demonstrates improved system performance and robustness compared to traditional distributed constraint optimization methods.
