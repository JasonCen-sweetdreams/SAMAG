Distributed task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where agents must coordinate to allocate tasks efficiently. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to learn coordination strategies for task allocation. We propose a decentralized framework, 'MARL-TA', which enables agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing environment conditions. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that MARL-TA outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
