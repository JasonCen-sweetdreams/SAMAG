Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in Information Retrieval (IR) where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Despite the success of traditional ranking models, they often struggle to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network architecture, 'DeepRank', that leverages the strengths of both neural networks and traditional ranking models. DeepRank combines a query-document interaction module with a neural ranking module to learn a robust and efficient ranking function. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DeepRank outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and query processing time.
