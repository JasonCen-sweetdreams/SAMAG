Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of data distribution and query patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to optimize query execution plans in distributed relational databases. Our method, called GNN-QO, represents the database schema and query graph as a heterogeneous graph, and uses GNNs to learn a compact representation of the query optimization problem. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark show that GNN-QO outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
