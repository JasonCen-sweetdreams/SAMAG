Ad-hoc search systems struggle to balance retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, particularly when dealing with large document collections. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'QueryAware', which learns query-adaptive document embeddings to facilitate efficient retrieval. By incorporating query semantics into the embedding space, QueryAware reduces the search space and enables fast filtering of irrelevant documents. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
