This paper proposes a novel document ranking approach that leverages hierarchical graph attention networks (HGAT) to model complex query-document relationships. Our method, dubbed QR-HGAT, represents queries and documents as graph-structured data and applies attention mechanisms at multiple granularity levels to capture both local and global semantic patterns. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QR-HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models in terms of ranking accuracy and robustness to query variations.
