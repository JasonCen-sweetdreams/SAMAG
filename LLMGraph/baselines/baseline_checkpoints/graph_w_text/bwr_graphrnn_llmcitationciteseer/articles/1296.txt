In distributed systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for optimal resource utilization and system performance. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'DMARL-TA', which enables autonomous agents to learn dynamic task allocation policies in real-time. We introduce a novel agent communication protocol that facilitates information sharing and coordination among agents, while respecting system constraints and resource limitations. Experimental results on a simulated distributed system demonstrate that DMARL-TA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and system throughput.
