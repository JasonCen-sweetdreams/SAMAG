Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between queries and relevant documents. This paper proposes a neural network-based QE approach, dubbed 'NeuroQE', which leverages dense embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. NeuroQE employs a multi-task learning framework, jointly training a query-document similarity model and a term-term similarity model. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing computational overhead.
