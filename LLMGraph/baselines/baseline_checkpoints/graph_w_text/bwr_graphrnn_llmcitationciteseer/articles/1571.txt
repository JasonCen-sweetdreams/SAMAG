Real-time data warehouses require efficient query optimization to meet stringent performance requirements. This paper proposes a novel adaptive query optimization framework, 'AQOR', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust query plans based on workload patterns and system resource utilization. AQOR employs a hybrid approach combining model-based and model-free reinforcement learning to balance exploration and exploitation. Our experiments on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrate that AQOR outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
