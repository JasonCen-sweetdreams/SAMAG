Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems struggle to capture the nuances of complex medical queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel query expansion approach, 'MedEmb', which leverages context-aware embeddings to enrich the semantic representation of medical queries. MedEmb incorporates domain-specific knowledge graphs to contextualize medical entities and concepts, enabling more effective query expansion. Our experiments on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art MIR systems.
