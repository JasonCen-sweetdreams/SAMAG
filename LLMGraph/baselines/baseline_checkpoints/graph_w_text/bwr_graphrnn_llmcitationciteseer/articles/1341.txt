The proliferation of IoT devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation mechanisms. This paper proposes a decentralized agent-based framework for allocating resources in IoT networks. Our approach leverages autonomous agents that negotiate and adapt to dynamic changes in the network. We introduce a novel auction-based mechanism that utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize resource allocation, leading to significant improvements in network throughput and latency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various IoT scenarios, including smart cities and industrial automation.
