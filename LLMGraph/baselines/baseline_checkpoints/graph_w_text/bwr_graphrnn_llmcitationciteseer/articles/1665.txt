Virtual reality (VR) has immense potential for immersive experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'GazeFlow', a novel framework that leverages gaze tracking and machine learning to provide personalized, real-time feedback to users in VR environments. GazeFlow adaptively adjusts the feedback intensity and type based on the user's gaze patterns, fostering increased engagement and immersion. Our user study with 30 participants demonstrates that GazeFlow significantly improves user satisfaction and reduces cognitive load compared to traditional feedback mechanisms.
