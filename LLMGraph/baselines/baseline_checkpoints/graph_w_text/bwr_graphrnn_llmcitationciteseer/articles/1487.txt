Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various industries, but user experience remains a significant barrier to widespread adoption. This paper explores the effect of personalized haptic feedback on user experience in VR environments. We propose a novel framework that incorporates machine learning-based models to predict user preferences and adapt haptic feedback accordingly. Our user study involving 30 participants shows that personalized haptic feedback significantly enhances user satisfaction, reduces motion sickness, and improves overall engagement. The results have important implications for the design of immersive VR experiences.
