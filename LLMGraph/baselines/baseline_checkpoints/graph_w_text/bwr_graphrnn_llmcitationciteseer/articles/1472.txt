This paper presents a novel approach to hierarchical task allocation for multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a two-level framework, where a high-level agent allocator assigns tasks to teams of agents, and a low-level agent controller optimizes task execution. Our method, Hierarchical Task Allocation with Deep Q-Networks (HTA-DQN), leverages the strengths of both centralized and decentralized control. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that HTA-DQN outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate, response time, and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
