Traditional information retrieval systems often rely on handcrafted features and ranking models, which may not capture the nuances of complex queries. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking approach that incorporates query expansion to improve document retrieval efficiency. Our model, dubbed 'DeepQE', leverages a hierarchical neural network to learn semantic representations of queries and documents, and then applies a reinforcement learning-based ranking strategy to optimize the retrieval process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models in terms of precision and recall, while reducing query latency by up to 30%.
