The rise of big data has led to the increasing adoption of hybrid relational-NoSQL databases, which combine the structured querying capabilities of relational databases with the scalability and flexibility of NoSQL systems. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'HybridOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and a hierarchical query rewriting approach to efficiently optimize queries in hybrid databases. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HybridOpt outperforms existing query optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
