Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to refine the original query to better capture user intent. While traditional QE methods rely on hand-crafted rules or statistical models, we propose a deep learning-based approach that learns query embeddings to effectively expand queries. Our model, dubbed QE-Embed, leverages a neural network to project queries into a dense vector space, where semantic relationships between terms are preserved. The learned embeddings are then used to select expansion terms, leading to significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc track demonstrate that QE-Embed outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, showcasing the effectiveness of deep learning in IR applications.
