Distributed database systems with heterogeneous storage architectures have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and improve query performance. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel cost-based query optimization framework that takes into account the storage characteristics of different nodes in the system. We introduce a new storage-aware cost model that estimates the execution time of queries based on the data distribution and storage capacity of each node. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
