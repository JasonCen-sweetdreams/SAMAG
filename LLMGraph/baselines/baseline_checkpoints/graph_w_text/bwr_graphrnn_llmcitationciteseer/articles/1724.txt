Robot planning in complex environments often relies on learned models that are difficult to interpret. This paper presents a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that learns to plan robot trajectories while providing explainable decision-making. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant objects and relations in the environment, enabling the robot to adapt to changing circumstances. We demonstrate the efficacy of HGAT in a variety of robotics tasks, including object manipulation and navigation, and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of planning efficiency and interpretability.
