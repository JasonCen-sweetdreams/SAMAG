Notification overload is a pervasive problem in modern computing, leading to distraction, fatigue, and decreased productivity. This paper presents a novel approach to adaptive notification filtering using gaze-based attention tracking. Our system, 'GazeFilter', leverages machine learning models trained on user gaze patterns to predict notification relevance and prioritize timely, context-aware interventions. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating significant reductions in notification dismissals and improved task performance compared to traditional filtering methods. The results have implications for HCI designs that support more harmonious human-computer interaction.
