Materialized views (MVs) are a crucial optimization technique in distributed database systems, as they enable fast query processing by pre-computing and storing intermediate results. However, maintaining MVs in the presence of frequent data updates and schema changes becomes a significant challenge. This paper presents 'MV-Fresher', a novel maintenance algorithm that leverages incremental view maintenance and adaptive sampling to reduce the overhead of MV updates. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database system demonstrates that MV-Fresher achieves up to 60% reduction in maintenance cost and 30% improvement in query performance compared to traditional approaches.
