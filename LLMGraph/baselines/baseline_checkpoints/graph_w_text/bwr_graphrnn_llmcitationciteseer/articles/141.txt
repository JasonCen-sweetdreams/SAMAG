This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating autonomous agents for efficient resource allocation in complex systems. We propose a decentralized deep reinforcement learning framework, 'CADRAL', which enables agents to learn cooperative strategies for allocating resources in real-time. CADRAL uses a hierarchical architecture to integrate local and global decision-making, and is shown to outperform traditional optimization methods in simulations of large-scale resource allocation problems. We evaluate CADRAL in a case study on smart grid energy management, demonstrating improved efficiency and adaptability in dynamic environments.
