Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability for older adults with hearing impairments is limited. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant that caters to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and audiologists to identify key design requirements. Our proposed system, 'HearMe', incorporates multimodal input, personalized audio augmentation, and visual feedback to enhance speech recognition accuracy and user experience. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
