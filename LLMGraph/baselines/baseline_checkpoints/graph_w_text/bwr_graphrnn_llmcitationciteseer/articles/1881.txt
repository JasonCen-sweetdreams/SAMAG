This paper presents a novel real-time object detection framework for autonomous vehicles, leveraging hierarchical attention networks to improve detection accuracy and efficiency. Our approach incorporates a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism, which adaptively weights features from different scales and levels of abstraction. We also propose a spatio-temporal attention module that selectively focuses on relevant regions and frames, reducing computational overhead. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of precision, recall, and speed, making it suitable for real-world autonomous driving applications.
