 Passage retrieval is a crucial task in information retrieval (IR), which involves retrieving relevant passages from a large document collection given a query. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach, 'PassRank', for document re-ranking in passage retrieval. PassRank leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to model the interactions between query, passage, and document contexts. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that PassRank outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency, particularly when dealing with long documents and complex queries.
