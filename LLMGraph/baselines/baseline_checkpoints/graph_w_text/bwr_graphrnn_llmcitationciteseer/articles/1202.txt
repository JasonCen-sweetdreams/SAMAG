Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require efficient route planning to minimize travel time and energy consumption. This paper presents a novel deep hierarchical reinforcement learning (DHRL) framework for AV route optimization. Our approach combines a high-level route planner with a low-level motion controller, using a hierarchical policy gradient method to optimize both route selection and motion control. We evaluate our framework on a realistic simulation environment and demonstrate significant improvements in travel time, energy efficiency, and safety compared to traditional graph-based methods.
