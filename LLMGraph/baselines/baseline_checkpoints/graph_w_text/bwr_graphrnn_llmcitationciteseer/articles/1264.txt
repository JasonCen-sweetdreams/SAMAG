With the increasing adoption of real-time data warehousing, efficient indexing techniques are crucial for supporting fast query processing. This paper presents STASH, a novel indexing approach that leverages skew-tolerant hashing to mitigate the impact of data skew on query performance. Our method adapts to the underlying data distribution and dynamically adjusts the hash function to minimize collisions, ensuring efficient query execution even in the presence of highly skewed data. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate a significant speedup in query processing time compared to traditional indexing techniques, making STASH an attractive solution for real-time data warehousing applications.
