Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of data distribution and indexing. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize query performance in DDS using machine learning-based index selection. We develop a framework that leverages query workload patterns and data distribution characteristics to predict the most effective index configurations. Our experimental results on a real-world DDS dataset demonstrate significant improvements in query response time and resource utilization compared to traditional indexing techniques.
