Real-time data warehousing requires efficient query processing to support timely decision-making. This paper proposes a novel column-oriented storage scheme, 'ColumnSpark', which leverages data compression, caching, and parallel processing to accelerate query performance. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that dynamically selects the most efficient storage layout and query execution plan based on query patterns and data characteristics. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that ColumnSpark outperforms traditional row-oriented storage by up to 5x in query response time and 3x in storage efficiency.
