Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized the way we interact with digital information, but existing interfaces often fail to account for users' emotional states. This paper presents 'EmoVR', an emotion-aware adaptive interface that leverages real-time physiological signals and machine learning to personalize the VR experience. Our approach incorporates a novel affective modeling framework that detects and responds to users' emotional shifts, dynamically adjusting the interface to optimize engagement, comfort, and overall user satisfaction. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates significant improvements in user experience and emotional well-being using EmoVR compared to traditional VR interfaces.
