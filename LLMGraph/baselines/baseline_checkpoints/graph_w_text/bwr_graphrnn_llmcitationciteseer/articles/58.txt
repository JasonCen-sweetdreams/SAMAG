This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for heterogeneous autonomous agents using reinforcement learning. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process, and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that enables agents to learn cooperative policies. Our approach leverages the strengths of each agent type and adaptively adjusts to changes in the environment. Experimental results demonstrate improved task completion efficiency and robustness compared to traditional auction-based methods in a variety of complex scenarios.
