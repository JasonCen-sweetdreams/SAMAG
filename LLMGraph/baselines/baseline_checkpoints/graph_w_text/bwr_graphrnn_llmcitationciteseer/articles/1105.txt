Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query processing in DDS remains a significant challenge due to the high latency and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach that leverages both vertical and horizontal partitioning to optimize query performance. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query workload and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces query response time by up to 40% compared to traditional indexing methods.
