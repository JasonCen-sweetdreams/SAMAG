Graph-based recommendation systems have shown promising results, but their computational complexity hinders their adoption in large-scale applications. We propose a novel graph attention network, 'GraphLite', that leverages sparse attention mechanisms and hierarchical graph pooling to reduce computational overhead. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets while reducing inference time by up to 75%. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the approximation error of GraphLite and demonstrate its scalability on a real-world e-commerce dataset.
