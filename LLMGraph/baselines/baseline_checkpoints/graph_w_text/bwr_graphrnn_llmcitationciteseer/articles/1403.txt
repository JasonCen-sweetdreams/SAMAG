In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive solutions. This paper presents a decentralized approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to agents in a distributed manner. Our proposed framework, 'DAGAT', utilizes a novel message-passing algorithm that integrates agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints to compute optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a simulation platform demonstrate that DAGAT outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized methods in terms of task completion time, agent utilization, and system scalability.
