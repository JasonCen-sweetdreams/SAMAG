Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, as models often struggle to adapt to novel tasks with limited data. This paper presents a novel deep meta-learning approach, 'TaskAware', which learns to adapt to new tasks by leveraging task-aware learning representations. Our method integrates a task-encoder module that captures task-specific knowledge and a meta-learner that generates task-adaptive weights. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TaskAware outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods, achieving improved accuracy and robustness in the presence of task diversity.
