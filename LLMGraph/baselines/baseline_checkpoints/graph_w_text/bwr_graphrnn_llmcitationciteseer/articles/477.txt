NoSQL databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale, heterogeneous data. However, efficient query processing remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'ApxIndex', that enables fast approximate query processing in NoSQL databases. ApxIndex leverages a probabilistic data structure to store summaries of data distributions, allowing for efficient estimation of query results. We demonstrate that ApxIndex achieves significant performance gains over traditional indexing methods while maintaining high accuracy. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that ApxIndex outperforms state-of-the-art solutions for range queries and aggregation operations.
