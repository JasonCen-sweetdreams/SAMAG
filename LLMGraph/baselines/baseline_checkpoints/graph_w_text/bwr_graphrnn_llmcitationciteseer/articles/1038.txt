Natural language search has become increasingly popular, but its efficiency is hindered by the need to process complex queries. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages semantic relationships between words to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. HQE uses a probabilistic graph model to capture term dependencies and identifies the most informative query terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQE achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods.
