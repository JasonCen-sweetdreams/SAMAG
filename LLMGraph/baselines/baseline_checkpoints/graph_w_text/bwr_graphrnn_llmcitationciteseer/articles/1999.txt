As the global population ages, it is essential to design interfaces that are accessible and usable for older adults. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach to designing gesture-based interfaces that cater to the needs of older adults. We propose a novel gesture recognition framework that leverages transfer learning and domain adaptation to improve recognition accuracy for older adults. Our user study with 30 older adults shows that our approach significantly reduces error rates and improves user satisfaction compared to existing gesture recognition systems. We also provide design guidelines for creating inclusive gesture-based interfaces that can be used in various applications, such as smart homes and healthcare systems.
