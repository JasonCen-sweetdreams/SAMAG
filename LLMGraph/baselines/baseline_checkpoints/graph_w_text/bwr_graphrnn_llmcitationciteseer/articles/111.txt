The proliferation of IoT sensors has generated vast amounts of time series data, making anomaly detection a critical task. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture for identifying anomalies in IoT sensor data. Our approach leverages multi-scale temporal dependencies and feature importance via a hierarchical attention mechanism. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and F1-score, while reducing computational overhead. We also provide insights into the interpretability of HAN's attention weights, enabling the identification of anomalous patterns and features.
