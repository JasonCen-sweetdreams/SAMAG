Optimizing query performance for star schema benchmarking is crucial in data warehousing applications. This paper proposes a novel approach to leverages column-store indexes for efficient query optimization. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that takes into account the unique properties of column-store indexes, enabling the query optimizer to make informed decisions about index selection and join ordering. Experimental results on a real-world star schema benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves an average query performance improvement of 2.5x compared to traditional row-store based optimization techniques.
