Traditional ranking models in information retrieval (IR) often rely on hand-crafted features and heuristics, which may not generalize well to diverse query types and document collections. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for document ranking, which learns to optimize ranking policies based on user interactions and relevance feedback. Our approach, 'DRL-Rank', utilizes a hierarchical neural network to model document representations and a policy gradient method to learn ranking strategies. Experimental results on benchmark IR datasets demonstrate that DRL-Rank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of precision and recall, while adapting to changing user preferences and query distributions.
