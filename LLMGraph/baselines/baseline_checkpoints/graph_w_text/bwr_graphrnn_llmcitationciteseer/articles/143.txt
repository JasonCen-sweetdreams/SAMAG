The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential growth in sensor data, posing significant challenges for real-time analytics. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'RTIndex', designed specifically for IoT sensor data. RTIndex leverages a combination of spatial and temporal locality to optimize query performance, while also incorporating a probabilistic filtering mechanism to reduce false positives. Experimental evaluations on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that RTIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of storage efficiency.
