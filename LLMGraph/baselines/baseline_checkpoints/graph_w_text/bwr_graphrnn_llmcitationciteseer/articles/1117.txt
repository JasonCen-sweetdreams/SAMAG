Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have revolutionized human-computer interaction in virtual reality (VR). This paper presents a novel framework for multimodal interaction with ECAs in VR, enabling users to engage in more natural and intuitive conversations. We introduce a machine learning-based approach to recognize and respond to users' gestures, facial expressions, and speech, creating a more immersive and interactive experience. Our user study demonstrates significant improvements in user engagement, task completion rates, and overall satisfaction compared to traditional text-based interfaces.
