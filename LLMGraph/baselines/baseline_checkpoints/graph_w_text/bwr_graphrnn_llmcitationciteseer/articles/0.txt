Skyline queries are essential in many applications, such as multi-criteria decision-making and data analysis. However, processing skyline queries efficiently on large-scale distributed databases remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'HierSky', which leverages a hierarchical structure to prune the search space and reduce communication overhead. Our empirical evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that HierSky outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 50% in terms of query response time and scales well with increasing data sizes.
