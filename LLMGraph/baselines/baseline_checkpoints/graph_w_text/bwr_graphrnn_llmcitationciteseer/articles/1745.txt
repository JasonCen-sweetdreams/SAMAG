Autonomous agent teams are increasingly used in various applications, such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and smart cities. However, efficient task allocation remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a decentralized approach to task allocation using distributed constraint optimization (DCOP). We propose a novel DCOP algorithm that leverages local communication and negotiation among agents to allocate tasks, taking into account their capabilities, preferences, and constraints. Experimental results using a simulated urban search and rescue scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms centralized methods in terms of solution quality, scalability, and adaptability to dynamic changes.
