Effective traffic management in smart cities relies on coordinated decision-making among autonomous agents. This paper presents a decentralized agent coordination framework based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which leverages real-time traffic data and agent interactions to optimize traffic flow. Our approach integrates GNN-based agent embeddings with a distributed constraint optimization algorithm to facilitate scalable and adaptive coordination. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulation platform demonstrate significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional centralized approaches.
