Traditional information retrieval systems rely on flat document representations, which fail to capture the hierarchical structure of documents. This paper proposes a novel document representation model, 'HiDR', which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to encode documents at multiple granularity levels. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiDR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency, particularly for long documents and sparse queries. We further analyze the effects of hierarchical representation on query-document matching and provide insights into the importance of contextualized representation for IR tasks.
