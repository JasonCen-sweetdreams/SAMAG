Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but they often overlook the needs of individuals with disabilities. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible conversational systems that cater to users with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments. We introduce a user-centered approach that incorporates inclusive design principles, multimodal interaction, and personalized accommodations. A comprehensive evaluation with 30 participants demonstrates that our approach significantly improves the usability, accessibility, and overall user experience for individuals with disabilities, paving the way for more inclusive human-computer interaction.
