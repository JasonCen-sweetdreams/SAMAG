This paper introduces a novel decentralized autonomous agent network (DAAN) framework for real-time traffic optimization. Our approach leverages multi-agent systems to model and simulate complex urban traffic dynamics, enabling real-time optimization of traffic signal control and route planning. We propose a distributed reinforcement learning algorithm that allows agents to adapt to changing traffic conditions and learn from each other's experiences. Experimental results using real-world traffic data from the city of San Francisco demonstrate significant reductions in travel times and congestion compared to traditional centralized optimization methods.
