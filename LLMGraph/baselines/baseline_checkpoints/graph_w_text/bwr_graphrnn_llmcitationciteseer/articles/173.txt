Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems often struggle to capture the nuances of complex biomedical queries. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep learning-based semantic embeddings to improve query expansion in MIR. Our method, dubbed 'MedEmb', uses a multi-layer perceptron to learn dense vector representations of medical concepts, which are then used to expand queries. Experiments on the TREC Genomics track dataset demonstrate that MedEmb significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a 23% increase in mean average precision.
