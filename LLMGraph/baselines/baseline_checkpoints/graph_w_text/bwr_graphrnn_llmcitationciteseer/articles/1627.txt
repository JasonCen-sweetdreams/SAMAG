In this paper, we propose a novel approach to real-time traffic management using coordinating autonomous agents. Our method, called Hierarchical Autonomous Traffic Management (HATM), leverages hierarchical reinforcement learning to enable agents to adapt to changing traffic conditions and coordinate with each other to optimize traffic flow. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HATM in simulations of a real-world traffic network, showing significant reductions in travel time and congestion. Our approach has the potential to revolutionize traffic management systems, enabling them to respond dynamically to changing traffic conditions and improve overall traffic efficiency.
