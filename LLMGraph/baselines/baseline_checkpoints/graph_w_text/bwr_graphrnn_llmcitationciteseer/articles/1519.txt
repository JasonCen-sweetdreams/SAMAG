Voice assistants have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but their design often neglects the needs of elderly users with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants that cater to this demographic. We conducted a series of interviews and usability studies to identify key challenges and preferences of elderly users. Our findings informed the development of 'ElderVoice', a novel voice assistant that incorporates adaptive dialogue management, personalized feedback, and multimodal interaction. Evaluation results show that ElderVoice significantly improves task completion rates and user satisfaction for elderly users with cognitive impairments.
