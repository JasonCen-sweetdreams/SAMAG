The proliferation of IoT devices and high-velocity data streams has created a pressing need for real-time analytics on large-scale datasets. Column-oriented NoSQL databases have emerged as a promising solution, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and query rewriting techniques to minimize latency and improve throughput. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrates that ColOpt achieves up to 3x speedup over state-of-the-art query optimizers for column-oriented NoSQL databases.
