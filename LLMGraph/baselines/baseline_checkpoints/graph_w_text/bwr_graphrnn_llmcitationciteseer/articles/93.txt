Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of graph traversal and the need to minimize communication overhead. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization, vertex-centric query rewriting, and dynamic join ordering to reduce query latency and improve system scalability. Experimental results on a range of graph benchmarks demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
