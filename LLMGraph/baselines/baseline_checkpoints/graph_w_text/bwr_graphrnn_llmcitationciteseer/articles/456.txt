Optimizing complex SQL queries is a crucial task in database management systems. Traditional optimization techniques often rely on heuristics or rule-based approaches, which can lead to suboptimal query plans. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based approach, 'RL-Optimizer', which learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. We introduce a novel state representation that captures the structural and semantic properties of SQL queries, enabling the RL agent to generalize to unseen queries. Experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers, achieving up to 30% reduction in query execution time.
