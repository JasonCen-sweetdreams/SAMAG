Ad-hoc search engines rely on query expansion to improve retrieval performance. However, traditional methods often suffer from high computational overhead and limited semantic understanding. This paper proposes 'NeuroXpand', a novel query expansion framework that leverages neural embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and documents. Our approach combines a neural encoder with a graph-based clustering algorithm to generate a compact set of expansion terms, reducing the dimensionality of the query space. Experiments on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and query throughput compared to state-of-the-art methods.
