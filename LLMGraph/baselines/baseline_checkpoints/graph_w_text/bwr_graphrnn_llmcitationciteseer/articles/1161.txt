In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'CATARINA', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignment among agents. We model the problem as a decentralized Markov decision process and train a neural network to learn coordinated policies for each agent. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that CATARINA outperforms state-of-the-art auction-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization, while adapting to dynamic changes in the environment.
