 Passage retrieval is a crucial step in many information retrieval applications, but existing neural ranking models often fail to effectively utilize the hierarchical structure of documents. We propose a novel neural ranking model, Hierarchical Passage Ranker (HPR), which incorporates document structure through a hierarchical attention mechanism. HPR first learns a document-level representation by aggregating passage-level features, and then uses this representation to compute a final ranking score. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HPR outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, particularly for documents with complex hierarchical structures.
