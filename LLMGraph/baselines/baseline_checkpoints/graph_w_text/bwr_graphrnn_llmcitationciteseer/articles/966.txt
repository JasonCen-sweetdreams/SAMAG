This paper presents a novel framework for autonomous agents to negotiate with multiple stakeholders in complex, dynamic environments. Our approach, called Adaptive Negotiation Strategy (ANS), leverages machine learning to adapt the negotiation strategy based on the stakeholder's preferences, power dynamics, and environmental factors. We evaluate ANS in a simulated supply chain management scenario, demonstrating improved negotiation outcomes and increased robustness to changes in stakeholder behavior compared to traditional, rule-based negotiation approaches.
