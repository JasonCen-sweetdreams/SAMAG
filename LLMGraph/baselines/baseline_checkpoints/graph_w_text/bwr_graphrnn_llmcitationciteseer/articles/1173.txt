Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to retrieve relevant documents due to the limited query context. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, 'QueryExpan', which leverages deep learning-based language models to generate contextualized document summaries. By incorporating these summaries into the retrieval process, QueryExpan significantly improves the retrieval performance, especially for short and ambiguous queries. Our experiments on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of QueryExpan in retrieving relevant documents, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
