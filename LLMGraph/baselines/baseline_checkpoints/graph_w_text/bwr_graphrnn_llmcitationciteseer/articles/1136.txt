Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, optimizing queries on large-scale graph databases remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to predict optimal query plans. Our technique, called 'GraphPlan', uses a combination of graph embeddings and reinforcement learning to learn a policy for selecting efficient query execution plans. Experimental results on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphPlan outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, reducing query execution times by up to 50%.
