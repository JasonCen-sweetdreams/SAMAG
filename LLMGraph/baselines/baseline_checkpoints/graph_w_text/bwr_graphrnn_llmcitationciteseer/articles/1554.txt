In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a challenging problem due to the decentralized nature of decision-making. This paper proposes an incentive-based mechanism that leverages agents' self-interest to allocate tasks efficiently. We design a novel auction protocol that allows agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. The protocol incorporates a reputation system to promote cooperation and punishes agents for misbehavior. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
