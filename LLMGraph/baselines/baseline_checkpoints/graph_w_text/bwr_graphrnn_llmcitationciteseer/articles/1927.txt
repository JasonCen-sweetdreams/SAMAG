Distributed database systems (DDBS) are crucial for large-scale data processing, but optimizing query workloads remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize query execution plans in DDBS. We design a DRL agent that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the database state, query workload, and system resources. Our experiments on a real-world DDBS show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
