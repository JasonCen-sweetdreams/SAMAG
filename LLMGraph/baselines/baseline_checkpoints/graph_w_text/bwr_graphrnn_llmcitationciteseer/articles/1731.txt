Cloud-native databases have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, efficient indexing techniques for multi-dimensional range queries remain a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel indexing scheme, 'SkyPiler', which leverages the concept of skyline points to prune the search space and reduce query latency. We propose a cost-based optimization framework that adaptively adjusts the index structure based on query patterns and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that SkyPiler outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query performance and 2x in terms of storage efficiency.
