Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) have become increasingly prevalent in modern information retrieval systems. However, the complexity of HINs poses significant challenges for effective document retrieval. This paper introduces a novel reinforced query expansion approach, RQE-HIN, which leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select expansion terms based on the heterogeneous relationships between entities in the network. Experimental results on a large-scale HIN dataset demonstrate that RQE-HIN outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness.
