Real-time database systems (RTDBS) require efficient query optimization techniques to ensure timely data retrieval under multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). Existing approaches focus on transactional overhead reduction, neglecting the impact of version management on query performance. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MVCC-Opt', which leverages version histograms and expiration times to prune unnecessary version accesses. We propose a cost-based optimization algorithm that considers both data freshness and query latency. Experimental results on a real-world RTDBS benchmark demonstrate that MVCC-Opt reduces average query response time by up to 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
