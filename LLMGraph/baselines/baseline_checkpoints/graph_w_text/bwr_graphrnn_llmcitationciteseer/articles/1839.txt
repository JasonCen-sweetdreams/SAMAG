Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability and accessibility for older adults remain limited. This paper presents a multimodal interaction framework, 'ElderVoice', which integrates speech, vision, and gesture recognition to facilitate more natural and inclusive interactions. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults and found that ElderVoice significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional voice-only assistants. Our framework's adaptive dialogue management and personalized feedback mechanisms also helped to reduce cognitive load and user frustration.
