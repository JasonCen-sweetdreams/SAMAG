Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in computer vision, where models must adapt to new classes with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical meta-learning approach, which leverages both task-level and class-level adaptability. Our method, called Hierarchical Adaptive Metric Learning (HAMLET), learns to generate task-specific metrics and class-specific prototypes in a hierarchical manner. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAMLET outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods, especially in settings with limited labeled data.
