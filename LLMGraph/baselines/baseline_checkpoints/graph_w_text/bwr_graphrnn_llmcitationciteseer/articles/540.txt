Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of the underlying infrastructure. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RL-Optimizer', that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our approach uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy that maximizes query performance while minimizing resource utilization. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource efficiency compared to traditional optimization techniques.
