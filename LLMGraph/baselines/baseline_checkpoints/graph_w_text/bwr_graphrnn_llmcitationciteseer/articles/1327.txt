Human-agent teams have shown great potential in various applications, but effective task allocation remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to coordinating human-agent teams using reinforcement learning (RL). Our method, called HARTA, learns to allocate tasks to humans and agents based on their strengths and weaknesses. HARTA incorporates a dynamic uncertainty model to adapt to changing task requirements and team member availability. We evaluate HARTA in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved team performance and reduced task completion time compared to traditional task allocation methods.
