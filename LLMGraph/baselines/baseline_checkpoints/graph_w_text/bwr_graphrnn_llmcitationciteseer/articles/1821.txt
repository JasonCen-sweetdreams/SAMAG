Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various industries, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatar customization on user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized or non-personalized avatar condition. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher engagement levels, as measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported enjoyment. Furthermore, we identified significant correlations between avatar customization features and user personality traits, suggesting that personalized avatars can enhance user experience by catering to individual preferences.
