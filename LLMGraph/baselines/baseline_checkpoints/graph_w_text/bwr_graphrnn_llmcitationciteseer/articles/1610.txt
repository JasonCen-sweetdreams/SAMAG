Information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to efficiently cluster large document collections, leading to suboptimal query performance. This paper introduces 'HIRCL', a novel hierarchical document clustering approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize clustering structures. By framing clustering as a Markov decision process, our DRL agent learns to adaptively select clustering granularity and merge policies, resulting in significant improvements in clustering quality and query response times. Experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of HIRCL in reducing mean average precision errors by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art clustering methods.
