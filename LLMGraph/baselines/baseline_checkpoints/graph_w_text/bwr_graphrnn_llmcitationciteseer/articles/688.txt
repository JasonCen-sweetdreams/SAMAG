Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants that cater to the unique requirements of older adults. We conducted a series of user studies and interviews to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed framework, 'ElderVoice', incorporates simplified voice commands, personalized feedback, and multimodal interaction to enhance usability and accessibility. A pilot study with 30 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion rates compared to existing voice assistants.
