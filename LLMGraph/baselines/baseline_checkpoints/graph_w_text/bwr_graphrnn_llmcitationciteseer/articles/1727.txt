Multi-agent systems often involve complex task allocation and planning. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task decomposition framework, 'GraphPlan', which leverages graph-based planning to efficiently allocate tasks among agents. GraphPlan represents task dependencies as a graph and employs a hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify subtasks that can be executed in parallel. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphPlan in a simulated disaster response scenario, showing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized planning approaches.
