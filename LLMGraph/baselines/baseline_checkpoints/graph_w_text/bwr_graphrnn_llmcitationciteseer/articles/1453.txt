With the increasing adoption of Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS), optimizing query performance for multiple tenants becomes a crucial challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MultiOpt', which leverages tenant workload patterns and resource utilization to minimize query latency. MultiOpt incorporates a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group similar tenant workloads and a cost-based optimizer to select the most efficient query plans. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world DBaaS platform shows that MultiOpt reduces average query latency by up to 35% compared to traditional optimization techniques, while ensuring fairness and isolation among tenants.
