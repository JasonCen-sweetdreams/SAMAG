Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, particularly in specialized domains where domain-specific knowledge is essential. This paper presents a neural QE approach, NeuroQE, which leverages domain-adversarial training to adapt to diverse domain-specific corpora. Our model incorporates a novel attention-based query-document interaction mechanism, enabling more effective expansion of query terms. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
