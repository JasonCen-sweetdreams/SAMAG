In complex multi-agent systems, coordinating individual agents to achieve global optimality is a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize resource allocation in decentralized systems. We introduce a hierarchical architecture consisting of a global coordinator and local agents, where each agent learns to adapt its behavior based on the coordinator's guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves resource utilization and reduces overall system cost, outperforming traditional heuristic-based methods in various scenarios.
