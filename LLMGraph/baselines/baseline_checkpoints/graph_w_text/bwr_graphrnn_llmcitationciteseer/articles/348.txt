Virtual reality (VR) systems often struggle to provide an optimal user experience due to the complexity of user interactions. This paper presents an innovative eye-tracking-based adaptive interface, 'EyeAdapt', which dynamically adjusts the VR environment to individual users' needs. By analyzing users' gaze patterns and pupillary responses, EyeAdapt identifies areas of interest and adjusts the visual layout, reducing cognitive load and improving task performance. We conduct a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in user satisfaction and task completion times compared to traditional VR interfaces.
