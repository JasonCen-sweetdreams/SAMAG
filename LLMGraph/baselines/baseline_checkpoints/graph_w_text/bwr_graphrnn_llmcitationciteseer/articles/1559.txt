The increasing adoption of distributed renewable energy sources in smart grids necessitates the development of autonomous agent-based control systems. This paper introduces a novel decentralized negotiation mechanism, 'CoalitionNet', which enables autonomous agents to form coalitions and negotiate energy trading agreements in a scalable and efficient manner. We leverage a combination of game-theoretic and machine learning techniques to design a multi-round negotiation protocol that adapts to changing grid conditions and agent preferences. Experimental results using real-world smart grid data demonstrate that CoalitionNet outperforms existing decentralized optimization methods in terms of negotiation efficiency and energy trading outcomes.
