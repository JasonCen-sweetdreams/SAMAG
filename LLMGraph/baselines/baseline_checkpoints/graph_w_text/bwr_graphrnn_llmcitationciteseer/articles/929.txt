Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various industries, but its adoption is hindered by user experience issues. Personalization has been proposed as a key factor in improving user experience, but its impact on VR remains understudied. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the effects of personalization on user experience in VR, examining factors such as user engagement, cognitive load, and emotional response. Our results show that personalized VR experiences lead to increased user engagement and reduced cognitive load, but also introduce biases in emotional response. We discuss the implications of these findings for VR system design and provide recommendations for incorporating personalization in VR applications.
