Coordinating multiple agents in complex, dynamic environments requires effective communication and cooperation strategies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables agents to selectively focus on relevant information and coordinate their actions. Our approach incorporates a multi-level attention mechanism that captures both local and global context, allowing agents to adapt to changing environments and optimize their joint performance. Experimental results in a simulated robotic soccer domain demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in improving team performance and providing insights into agent decision-making processes.
