Ad-hoc retrieval systems rely on effective query representation to retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages hierarchical topic modeling (HTM) to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, HTM-QE, recursively applies HTM to generate a hierarchical representation of the query, enabling the incorporation of contextualized term weights and phrase-level dependencies. Experiments on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that HTM-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, with significant improvements in precision and recall.
