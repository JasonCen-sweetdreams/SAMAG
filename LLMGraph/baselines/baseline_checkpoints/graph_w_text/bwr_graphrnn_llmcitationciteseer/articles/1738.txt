This paper presents a novel hierarchical agent-based modeling approach for real-time traffic flow prediction. Our method, dubbed 'AgentFlow', leverages the strengths of both macroscopic and microscopic traffic modeling by recursively decomposing the traffic network into smaller, interacting agent-based sub-models. This hierarchical structure enables the capture of complex traffic dynamics at multiple scales, while reducing computational overhead. We evaluate AgentFlow on a large-scale urban traffic dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
