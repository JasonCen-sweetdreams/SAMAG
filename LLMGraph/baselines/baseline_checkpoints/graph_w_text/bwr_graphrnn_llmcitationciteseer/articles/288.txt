Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly popular in various applications, including gaming, virtual reality, and smart home devices. However, existing systems often struggle to accurately recognize and interpret complex gestures. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep learning techniques to augment traditional gesture recognition systems. Our approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract spatial and temporal features from gesture data, followed by a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the dynamics of user gestures. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale gesture dataset and demonstrate significant improvement in recognition accuracy and user experience compared to state-of-the-art methods.
