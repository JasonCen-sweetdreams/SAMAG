In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and adaptive decision-making. This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn agent-agent and agent-task relationships. Our approach, called GNN-TA, uses a distributed GNN architecture to enable agents to communicate and negotiate task assignments in a decentralized manner. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms traditional centralized and auction-based approaches in terms of task completion rate and overall system efficiency.
