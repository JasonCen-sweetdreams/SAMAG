Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can significantly degrade their performance. This paper proposes a novel input preprocessing technique, 'DefendNet', that enhances the robustness of DNNs against such attacks. DefendNet applies a hierarchical transformation to the input data, which detects and suppresses perturbations introduced by adversarial attacks. We evaluate the efficacy of DefendNet on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing defense mechanisms. Our approach achieves a significant improvement in model accuracy under attack, while maintaining computational efficiency.
