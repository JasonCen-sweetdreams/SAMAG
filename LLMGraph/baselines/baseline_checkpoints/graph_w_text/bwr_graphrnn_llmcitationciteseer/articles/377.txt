Modern main-memory database systems (MMDBs) rely on concurrency control mechanisms to ensure transactional consistency. However, traditional approaches incur significant performance overhead due to logging, locking, and latching. This paper proposes a novel transaction-aware concurrency control scheme, 'TACCM', which leverages the inherent parallelism of MMDBs. TACCM dynamically adjusts concurrency levels based on transaction conflict rates, reducing overhead while maintaining correctness. Experimental evaluations on a real-world workload demonstrate that TACCM achieves up to 3.5x throughput improvement over state-of-the-art solutions.
