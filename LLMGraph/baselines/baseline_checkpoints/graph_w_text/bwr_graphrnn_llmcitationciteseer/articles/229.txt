The proliferation of large-scale distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems has necessitated the development of efficient indexing techniques to facilitate fast query processing. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical cluster-based indexing approach, HCI+, which leverages the inherent structural properties of distributed datasets to reduce query latency. HCI+ employs a multi-level clustering strategy that adaptively partitions the index into hierarchical clusters, enabling efficient query routing and pruning. Experimental evaluations on real-world web datasets demonstrate that HCI+ outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving up to 35% reduction in query response time while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy.
