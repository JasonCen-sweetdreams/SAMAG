Hybrid memory database systems (HMDBs) have gained popularity due to their performance benefits in modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing query performance in HMDBs remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'HybOpt', which leverages both CPU and GPU processing units to accelerate query execution. We develop a cost model that takes into account the memory hierarchy, query patterns, and data distribution to effectively allocate queries to either CPU or GPU. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HybOpt achieves significant performance improvements compared to traditional query optimization techniques, with speedups of up to 3.5x for complex analytical queries.
