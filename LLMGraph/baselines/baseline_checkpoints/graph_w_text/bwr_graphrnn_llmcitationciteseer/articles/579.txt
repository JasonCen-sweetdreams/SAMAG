Effective coordination of multi-agent systems (MAS) is crucial in various applications, including robotics, smart grids, and traffic management. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating MAS through hierarchical task decomposition and reinforcement learning. We introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks, which are then allocated to agents using a reinforcement learning-based mechanism. Our approach enables agents to learn from experience, adapt to changing environments, and coordinate with each other to achieve global objectives. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a simulated traffic management scenario, showcasing improved coordination and reduced congestion.
