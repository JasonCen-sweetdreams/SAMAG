Dynamic graphs are ubiquitous in modern applications, necessitating efficient view maintenance techniques. We propose 'DynaHash', a novel incremental view maintenance approach that leverages distributed hash tables (DHTs) to process graph updates in parallel. DynaHash ensures consistency and minimizes communication overhead by exploiting the inherent structure of the graph. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate a significant reduction in view maintenance time compared to existing solutions, while achieving high accuracy and scalability.
