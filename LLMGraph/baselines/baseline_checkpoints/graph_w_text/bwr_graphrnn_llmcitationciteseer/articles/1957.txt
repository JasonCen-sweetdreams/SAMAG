As urban populations grow, efficient traffic management becomes increasingly crucial. This paper presents 'MAATM', a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for autonomous traffic signal control. By leveraging graph neural networks and a novel communication protocol, MAATM scales to large networks and adapts to dynamic traffic patterns. Experimental results on a realistic simulation platform demonstrate significant reductions in congestion and travel times, outperforming traditional optimization methods and existing deep reinforcement learning approaches.
