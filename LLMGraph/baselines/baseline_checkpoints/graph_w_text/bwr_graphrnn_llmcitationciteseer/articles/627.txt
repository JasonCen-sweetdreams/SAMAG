Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, NSE-QE, which leverages neural semantic embeddings to enrich query representations. By learning dense vector representations of words and entities, NSE-QE can effectively capture contextual dependencies and semantic relationships between query terms. Experimental results on several standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that NSE-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in terms of precision, recall, and MAP.
