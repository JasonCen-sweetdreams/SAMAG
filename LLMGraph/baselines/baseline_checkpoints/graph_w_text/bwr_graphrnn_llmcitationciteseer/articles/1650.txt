Virtual assistants (VAs) have the potential to improve the daily lives of aging adults with cognitive impairments. However, current VA designs often neglect the unique needs of this population. This paper presents a multimodal VA framework that incorporates visual, auditory, and tactile feedback to facilitate task completion. We conducted a user study with 20 aging adults with cognitive impairments and found that our approach significantly improved task accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional VA designs. Our framework also includes a novel cognitive load assessment module that adaptively adjusts the VA's communication style to the user's cognitive state.
