This paper presents a novel, multimodal approach to designing conversational interfaces that are accessible and engaging for older adults. We propose a framework that integrates speech, gesture, and facial expression recognition to facilitate more natural and intuitive interactions. Our user study with 30 older adults (ages 65-85) shows that the proposed interface significantly improves task completion rates, reduces errors, and enhances user satisfaction compared to traditional text-based interfaces. We also provide design guidelines and recommendations for incorporating accessibility features in conversational systems.
