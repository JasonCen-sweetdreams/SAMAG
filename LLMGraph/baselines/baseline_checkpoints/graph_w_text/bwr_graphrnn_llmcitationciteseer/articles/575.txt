This paper addresses the problem of planning for multi-agent systems in environments with incomplete information. We propose a hierarchical task network (HTN) planning framework that integrates probabilistic reasoning and decision-theoretic planning to handle uncertainty. Our approach leverages a novel representation of incomplete information as probabilistic constraints, enabling agents to reason about the likelihood of task success. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, showcasing improved plan quality and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
