Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) that aims to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'SemExpan', which leverages semantic embeddings to learn the relationships between query terms and expand the query with relevant keywords. We employ a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion and relevance ranking, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of SemExpan over traditional query expansion methods.
