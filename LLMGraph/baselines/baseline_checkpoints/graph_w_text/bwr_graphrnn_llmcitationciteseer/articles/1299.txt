Query expansion is a crucial step in modern information retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to re-rank candidate expansion terms. Our method, dubbed 'DeepExpan', combines a BERT-based language model with a learning-to-rank framework to optimize the selection of expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepExpan significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving an average of 15% improvement in mean average precision.
