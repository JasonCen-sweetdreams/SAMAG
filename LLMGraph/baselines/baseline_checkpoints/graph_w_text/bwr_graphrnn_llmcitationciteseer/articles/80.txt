Dialogue state tracking (DST) is a crucial component of conversational AI systems, requiring the accurate identification of user intents and slots across multiple modalities. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for efficient multi-modal DST. Our approach leverages a hierarchical structure to model the relationships between utterances, modalities, and slots, while incorporating attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant context. Experimental results on the MultiWOZ 2.1 dataset demonstrate that our HAN-based model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of joint goal accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world deployment.
