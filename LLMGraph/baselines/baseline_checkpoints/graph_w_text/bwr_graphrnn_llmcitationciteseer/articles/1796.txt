Distributed database systems (DDS) are increasingly used to manage large-scale datasets. However, efficient querying of multi-dimensional data remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'MDR-Tree', which enables fast range queries in DDS. MDR-Tree leverages a hierarchical clustering approach to partition the data space, reducing the number of nodes to be traversed during query execution. Experiments on a real-world climate dataset demonstrate that MDR-Tree outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving up to 3x faster query response times and 2x better storage efficiency.
