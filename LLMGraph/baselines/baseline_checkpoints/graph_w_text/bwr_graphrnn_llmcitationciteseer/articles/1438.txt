This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework for efficient multi-robot task allocation in dynamic environments. We propose a two-level hierarchy, where a high-level policy learns to allocate tasks to robots based on their capabilities and the environment, and a low-level policy controls the robot's actions to execute the assigned tasks. Our approach leverages a Graph Attention Network to model the interactions between robots and tasks, and a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm to learn the policies. Experimental results in a simulated warehouse scenario demonstrate that our HRL framework achieves significant improvements in task completion time and robot utilization compared to traditional methods.
