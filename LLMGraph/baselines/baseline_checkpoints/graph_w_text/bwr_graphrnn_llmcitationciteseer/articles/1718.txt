Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HiIDX', which leverages the hierarchical structure of the data distribution to minimize query latency. We demonstrate that HiIDX outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time, while maintaining similar storage overhead. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that HiIDX is particularly effective for range queries and aggregation operations.
