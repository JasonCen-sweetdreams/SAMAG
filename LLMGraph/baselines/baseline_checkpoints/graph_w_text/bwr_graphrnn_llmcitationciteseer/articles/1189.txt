This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for real-time traffic management. Our approach, called 'TrafficMA', leverages autonomous agents to optimize traffic signal control and routing in complex urban networks. We introduce a novel coordination mechanism, 'Async-QL', which enables agents to learn from each other's experiences and adapt to changing traffic patterns. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate that TrafficMA outperforms traditional traffic management systems, reducing congestion and travel times by up to 25%.
