Distributed database systems require efficient data replication strategies to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. However, existing approaches often rely on manual configuration and static replication policies. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach to data replication, which leverages graph neural networks to predict data access patterns and optimize replication decisions. Our experiments on a large-scale distributed database show that the proposed approach achieves up to 30% improvement in read performance and 25% reduction in replication overhead compared to traditional methods.
