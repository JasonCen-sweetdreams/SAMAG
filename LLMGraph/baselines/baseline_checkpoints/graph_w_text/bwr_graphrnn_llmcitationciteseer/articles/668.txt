Real-time traffic flow prediction is crucial for optimizing urban transportation systems. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in modeling complex traffic patterns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that integrates multi-scale graph attention mechanisms to capture both local and global traffic dependencies. We evaluate HGAT on a large-scale traffic dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art GNN-based methods.
