This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework for autonomous agents using reinforcement learning. We formulate the task allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and develop a multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to learn optimal task assignments. Our approach enables agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and task requirements, while minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results in a simulated robotic swarm scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion efficiency and robustness to agent failures.
