Short text queries are ubiquitous in modern search engines, but their brevity often makes it challenging to accurately capture user intent. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'RL-Embed', which leverages word embeddings and reinforcement learning to generate context-aware expansions. Our approach learns to optimize the trade-off between query similarity and relevance by iteratively refining the expansion process using user feedback. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-Embed outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly for short text queries, and achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
