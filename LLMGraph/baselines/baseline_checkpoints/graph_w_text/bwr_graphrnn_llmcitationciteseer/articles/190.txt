Coordinating multiple agents in dynamic environments is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that learns to represent agents' interactions and cooperatively reason about their goals. HGAT combines graph attention with hierarchical reinforcement learning to enable agents to adapt to changing environments and communicate effectively. Experimental results on a simulated robotic soccer domain show that HGAT outperforms existing approaches in terms of team performance and adaptability, while reducing communication overhead.
