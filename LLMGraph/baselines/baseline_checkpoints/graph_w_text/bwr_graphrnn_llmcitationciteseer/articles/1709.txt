Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, which aims to reformulate the original query to retrieve more relevant documents. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our method, 'DRL-QE', learns to select the most informative terms from the top-retrieved documents and incorporates them into the original query. We formulate the query expansion process as a Markov decision process and utilize a deep Q-network to learn the optimal policy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DRL-QE achieves significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion methods.
