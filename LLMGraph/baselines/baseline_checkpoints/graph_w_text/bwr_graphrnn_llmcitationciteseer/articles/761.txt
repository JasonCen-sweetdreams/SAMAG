With the increasing adoption of RDF data models in various domains, efficient query processing over distributed RDF databases has become a pressing concern. This paper presents a novel approach to scalable query optimization, dubbed 'DistriQP', which leverages graph-based query decomposition and dynamic task scheduling to minimize network communication overhead. Our experimental evaluation on the popular WatDiv benchmark demonstrates that DistriQP outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time and scales to large-scale distributed RDF deployments.
