This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in Virtual Reality (VR) environments, focusing on its impact on user experience. We designed a VR-based experiment to examine how users' bodily movements and gestures influence their interaction with virtual objects. Our results show that incorporating embodied cognition principles into VR design can lead to improved spatial awareness, reduced cognitive load, and enhanced user engagement. We propose a novel framework for embodied cognition-driven VR interface design, which can be applied to various domains such as education, entertainment, and healthcare.
