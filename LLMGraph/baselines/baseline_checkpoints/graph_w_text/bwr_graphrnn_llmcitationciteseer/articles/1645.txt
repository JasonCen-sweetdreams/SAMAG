Document expansion techniques have been shown to improve retrieval performance in sparse domains. However, most approaches rely on generic term weighting schemes, neglecting the semantic context in which queries are issued. This paper proposes a novel context-aware document expansion framework, 'CADE', which leverages entity disambiguation and semantic role labeling to incorporate contextual information into the expansion process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CADE outperforms state-of-the-art document expansion methods, especially in scenarios where query context is crucial for disambiguating ambiguous keywords.
