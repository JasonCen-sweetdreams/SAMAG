In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model complex agent-interaction dynamics. Our approach, dubbed 'Agent-GCN', learns a distributed representation of agent capabilities and task requirements, enabling agents to make informed decisions about task assignments. Experimental results on a simulated logistics domain demonstrate that Agent-GCN outperforms traditional decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency.
