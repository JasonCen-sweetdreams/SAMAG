Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval to improve the retrieval performance of ad-hoc search systems. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion by leveraging deep neural network-based keyword embeddings. Our method, dubbed 'QE-Embed', represents keywords as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic relationships between terms. We demonstrate that QE-Embed outperforms traditional query expansion methods on several benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain. Furthermore, we show that QE-Embed is efficient and scalable, making it suitable for large-scale search applications.
