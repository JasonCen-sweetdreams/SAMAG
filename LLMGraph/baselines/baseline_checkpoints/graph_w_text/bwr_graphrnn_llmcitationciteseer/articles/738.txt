Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, query optimization in these systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize query plans based on the database's workload and hardware configuration. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
