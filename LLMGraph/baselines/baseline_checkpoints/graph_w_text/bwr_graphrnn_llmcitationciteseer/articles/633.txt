Virtual reality (VR) systems rely on accurate gesture recognition to provide immersive experiences. However, the cognitive load imposed by VR interfaces can affect users' gesture performance. This study examines the relationship between cognitive load and gesture recognition accuracy in VR. We designed a series of experiments using a custom-built VR setup and performed gesture recognition tasks under varying cognitive load conditions. Our results show that increased cognitive load significantly degrades gesture recognition accuracy, particularly for complex gestures. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more intuitive and robust VR interfaces.
