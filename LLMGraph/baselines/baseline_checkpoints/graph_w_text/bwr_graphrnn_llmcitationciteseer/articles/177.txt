The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential increase in time series data, making anomaly detection a critical task. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'TS-ADNet', which leverages the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to detect anomalies in time series data. Our approach incorporates a hybrid encoder-decoder architecture that captures both local and global patterns in the data, improving detection accuracy and reducing false positives. Experimental results on real-world IoT datasets demonstrate the superiority of TS-ADNet over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its potential for real-time anomaly detection in IoT systems.
