Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data analysis, where the goal is to predict the labels of unseen nodes. We propose a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) architecture that leverages the hierarchical structure of graphs to improve node classification performance. Our model employs attention mechanisms at multiple scales to selectively focus on relevant nodes and neighborhoods, and adaptively combines features from different hierarchical levels. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN in achieving state-of-the-art performance, especially on graphs with complex hierarchical structures.
