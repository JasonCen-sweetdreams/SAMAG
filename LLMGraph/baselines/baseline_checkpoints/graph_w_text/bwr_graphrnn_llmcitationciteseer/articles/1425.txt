 Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly popular, but individuals with motor impairments often face significant barriers to using these systems. This paper presents a co-design approach to creating accessible gesture-based interfaces, involving individuals with motor impairments throughout the design process. We investigate the use of machine learning-based gesture recognition algorithms adapted for motor-impaired users, and evaluate our approach through a user study with 20 participants. Our results show significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction, demonstrating the importance of inclusive design in HCI.
