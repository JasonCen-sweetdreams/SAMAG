Virtual reality (VR) experiences often rely on visual and auditory cues, neglecting the potential of haptic feedback to enhance user engagement. This study investigates the impact of personalized haptic feedback on user experience in VR environments. We present a novel framework for generating tailored haptic effects based on individual user preferences and behavior. Our user study involving 30 participants shows that personalized haptic feedback significantly increases user engagement, reduces cybersickness, and improves overall VR experience. We discuss implications for VR application design and highlight future research directions.
