Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the semantic gap between user queries and relevant documents. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages deep contextualized embeddings to enhance query expansion for ad-hoc retrieval. Our method, dubbed 'EmbEx', utilizes a pre-trained language model to generate contextualized embeddings for query terms and expansion candidates. These embeddings are then used to compute a semantic similarity measure, which is integrated into a ranking model to re-weight the expanded query terms. Experimental results on several standard TREC datasets demonstrate that EmbEx significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a relative improvement of up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
