Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in decentralized settings where agents have limited communication and partial knowledge of the environment. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies in a distributed manner. Our method, called GNN-TA, represents the agent-environment interaction as a graph and uses GNNs to learn a joint policy that optimizes task allocation and execution. Experimental results in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to changing environment conditions.
