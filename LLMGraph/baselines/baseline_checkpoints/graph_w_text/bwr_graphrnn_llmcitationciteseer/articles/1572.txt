Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it enhances the retrieval of relevant documents by incorporating related terms into the original query. However, existing query expansion methods suffer from high computational complexity and suboptimal performance in large-scale document collections. This paper proposes a hierarchical query expansion approach, termed 'HQE', which leverages a multi-level indexing structure to efficiently identify relevant terms and expand the query. Experimental results on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
