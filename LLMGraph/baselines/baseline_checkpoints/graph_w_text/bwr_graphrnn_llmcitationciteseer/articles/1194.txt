Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large volumes of data. However, query optimization in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate query optimization as a Markov Decision Process and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query execution. Our approach is able to adapt to changing database workloads and outperforms traditional rule-based optimization techniques. Experimental results on a distributed database benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization.
