In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving system-wide objectives. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic environments and agent capabilities. We introduce a decentralized Q-learning approach, where agents learn to select tasks based on their expected rewards and communicate with neighbors to avoid conflicts. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and system throughput, while also promoting fairness and robustness in the face of agent failures.
