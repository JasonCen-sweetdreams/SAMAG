Ad-hoc retrieval in large-scale document collections is a fundamental task in information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, dubbed 'NQE', which leverages a pre-trained language model to generate semantically relevant expansion terms. NQE is designed to reduce the computational overhead associated with traditional query expansion methods, making it suitable for real-time search applications. Experimental results on the TREC news dataset demonstrate that NQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of mean average precision and retrieval efficiency.
