Neural search models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but they often struggle with limited query context. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to inject semantic meaning into the query representation. Our method, KG-Expan, uses a graph attention network to learn entity relationships and generate expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on the TREC CAR dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for verbose and ambiguous queries.
