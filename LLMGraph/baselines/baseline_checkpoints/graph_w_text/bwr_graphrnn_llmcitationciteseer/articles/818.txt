Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and system scalability. This paper explores the application of deep reinforcement learning to query optimization, leveraging the strengths of both query optimization techniques and reinforcement learning. We propose a novel framework, 'DQN-QO', which utilizes a deep Q-network to learn query optimization strategies from a large dataset of query plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate that DQN-QO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques, achieving up to 30% improvement in query execution time.
