In high-stakes environments, human decision-makers often rely on intuition and experience to make critical decisions. This paper proposes a real-time human-AI collaboration framework that leverages the strengths of both humans and AI systems. Our approach, 'HybridMind', integrates a cognitive modeling component to capture human decision-making biases and a machine learning module to provide data-driven recommendations. We evaluate HybridMind in a simulated emergency response scenario, demonstrating improved decision accuracy and reduced response time compared to human-only or AI-only decision-making approaches.
