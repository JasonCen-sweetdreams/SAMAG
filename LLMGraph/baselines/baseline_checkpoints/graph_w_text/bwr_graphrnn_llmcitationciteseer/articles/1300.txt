Patent retrieval is a challenging task due to the complexity and ambiguity of patent documents. Query expansion is a widely used technique to improve retrieval effectiveness, but traditional methods often rely on manual tuning and domain expertise. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'Patent2Vec', which leverages neural networks to learn semantic representations of patent queries and expand them with relevant terms. Our experiments on a large patent dataset demonstrate that Patent2Vec outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
