Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the quality of search results. This paper proposes a neural query expansion model that leverages context-aware embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our approach utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to model the interactions between query terms, document keywords, and their surrounding contexts. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, particularly in scenarios with ambiguous or incomplete queries.
