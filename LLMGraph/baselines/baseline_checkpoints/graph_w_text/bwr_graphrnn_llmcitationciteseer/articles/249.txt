Explainable AI is crucial in recommendation systems to gain user trust. We propose a novel Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HGNN) framework, 'ExplainRec', which integrates graph attention and meta-learning to generate personalized explanations for AI-driven recommendations. Our approach leverages multi-modal user data and item relationships to learn explainable representations. Experiments on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate that ExplainRec outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation models while providing interpretable explanations for recommended items.
