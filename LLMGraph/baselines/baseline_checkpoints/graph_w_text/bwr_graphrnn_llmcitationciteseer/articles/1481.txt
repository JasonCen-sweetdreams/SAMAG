The proliferation of fake news on social media has severe consequences on public opinion and democracy. Existing fake news detection methods often rely on handcrafted features or shallow neural networks, which are limited in capturing complex graph structures and relationships between news articles. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) that leverages the graph structure of news articles and their propagation patterns on social networks. HAGNN learns to identify fake news by hierarchically aggregating attentive features from both local and global graph structures. Our experiments on a large-scale fake news dataset demonstrate that HAGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, achieving an F1-score of 92.1%.
