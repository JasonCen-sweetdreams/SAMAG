Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in information retrieval, where the goal is to resolve ambiguous entities in a query to their corresponding entities in a knowledge graph. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive approach using graph-based neural networks, which learns to adapt to the query context and incorporate semantic relationships between entities. Our model, QADE, leverages a heterogeneous graph attention mechanism to jointly model entity mentions, query context, and knowledge graph relationships. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that QADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12% relative improvement in disambiguation accuracy.
