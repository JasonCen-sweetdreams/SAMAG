Image retrieval systems often rely on textual queries, which can be limited by the user's vocabulary and context. This paper proposes a novel semantic query expansion approach using deep reinforcement learning, which learns to generate context-aware and semantically rich queries. Our method, dubbed 'SQR', leverages a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the query expansion process, leveraging both visual and textual features from the images. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SQR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving up to 25% improvement in retrieval accuracy.
