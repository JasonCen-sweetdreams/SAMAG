Multi-tenant database systems are increasingly popular in cloud computing, but they pose significant challenges in terms of query performance optimization. Traditional approaches rely on manual tuning and heuristics, which can be time-consuming and ineffective. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach, 'ML-Optimizer', which uses supervised learning to predict optimal query plans for diverse workloads. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that ML-Optimizer outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and resource utilization.
