The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors has led to an exponential increase in time-series data, necessitating efficient query optimization techniques for real-time analytics. This paper presents a novel indexing scheme, 'TSIndex', which leverages a combination of piecewise aggregation and hierarchical clustering to accelerate range and aggregation queries. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that TSIndex outperforms existing indexing methods, achieving an average query speedup of 3.5x while reducing indexing overhead by 40%. We also propose an adaptive indexing framework that dynamically adjusts to changing data distributions, ensuring robust performance under varying workloads.
