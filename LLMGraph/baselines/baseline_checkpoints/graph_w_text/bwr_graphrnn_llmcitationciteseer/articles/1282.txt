Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the quality of life for older adults by enabling intuitive control of smart home devices. However, current systems often fail to account for age-related physical and cognitive decline. This paper presents an inclusive design approach that incorporates participatory design workshops, user studies, and machine learning-based gesture recognition algorithms tailored to the needs of older adults. Our system achieves a 25% improvement in gesture recognition accuracy compared to existing systems, and user studies demonstrate increased user satisfaction and accessibility.
