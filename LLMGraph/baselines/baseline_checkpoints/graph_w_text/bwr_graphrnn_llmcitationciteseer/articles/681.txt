Edge computing has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to reduce latency and improve real-time processing. However, efficient resource allocation in edge computing environments remains a major challenge. This paper proposes a novel intelligent agent-based framework that leverages decentralized decision-making to allocate resources dynamically. Our approach utilizes a multi-agent system, where each agent is capable of learning and adapting to changing workload patterns. We evaluate our framework using a real-world edge computing dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization, response time, and overall system efficiency compared to traditional centralized approaches.
