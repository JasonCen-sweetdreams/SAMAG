Deep neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can significantly degrade their performance. This paper investigates the effectiveness of input preprocessing techniques in improving the robustness of deep neural networks against such attacks. We propose a novel framework that combines multiple preprocessing methods, including data augmentation, feature scaling, and noise injection. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the robustness of deep neural networks, with an average increase of 23.4% in accuracy against state-of-the-art attacks.
