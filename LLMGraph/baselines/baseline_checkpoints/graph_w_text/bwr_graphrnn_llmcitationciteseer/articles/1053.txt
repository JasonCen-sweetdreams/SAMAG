As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible interfaces that cater to older adults. Gestural interfaces have shown promise, but their adoption is hindered by the complexity of gesture recognition. This paper proposes a machine learning-based approach to recognize gestures from older adults, using a novel dataset of elderly-specific gestures. We investigate the effectiveness of various deep learning architectures and explore the impact of age-related factors on gesture recognition accuracy. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in recognition rates, paving the way for more accessible gestural interfaces that can be used by older adults.
