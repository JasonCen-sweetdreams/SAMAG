In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is a crucial task that enables agents to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a decentralized Bayesian learning approach for coalition formation, where agents learn to form coalitions based on their individual preferences and uncertain environment. We introduce a novel Bayesian network structure that models the agents' preferences and uncertainty, and develop an efficient inference algorithm to compute the coalition formation probability. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in forming optimal coalitions and adapting to changing environment conditions.
