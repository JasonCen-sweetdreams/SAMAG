Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often suffer from limited supervision, leading to ineffective query representations. This paper proposes a neural query expansion framework, 'NQE-LS', which leverages a combination of keyword extraction and generative adversarial networks to improve retrieval performance. NQE-LS learns to expand queries with relevant terms, even in the presence of sparse and noisy supervision. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain over state-of-the-art baselines.
