Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on simple term co-occurrence or manual feature engineering. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RSGE', which leverages reinforced semantic graph embeddings to learn query-specific expansions. Our method represents queries and documents as graph-structured semantic embeddings, and uses reinforcement learning to optimize the expansion process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RSGE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing computational overhead.
