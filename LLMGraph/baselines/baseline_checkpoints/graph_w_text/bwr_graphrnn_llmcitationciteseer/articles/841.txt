Decentralized task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems is a challenging problem due to the complexity of agent interactions and the need for adaptability to dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn decentralized task allocation policies. We introduce a hierarchical framework that combines a high-level task allocation module with low-level agent controllers, enabling agents to learn effective task assignments and execution strategies. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in achieving improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional methods.
