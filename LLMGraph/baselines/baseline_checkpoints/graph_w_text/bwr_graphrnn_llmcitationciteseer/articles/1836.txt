Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'EmbedQE', which leverages word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms. We introduce a graph-based method to select the most informative expansion terms, considering both local and global context. Experimental results on several TREC collections demonstrate that EmbedQE outperforms traditional QE methods, achieving significant gains in precision and recall.
