Public displays are increasingly prevalent in urban spaces, but their security is compromised by the lack of user authentication mechanisms. This paper proposes an eye-gaze based authentication system using deep learning. We design a convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to identify users based on their eye movements on a public display. Our approach leverages a novel gaze-tracking method that exploits the display's built-in camera and ambient light sensors. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate a significant improvement in authentication accuracy and speed compared to traditional password-based methods.
