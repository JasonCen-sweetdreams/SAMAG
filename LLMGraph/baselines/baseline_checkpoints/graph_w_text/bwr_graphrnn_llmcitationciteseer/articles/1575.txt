Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but users often struggle to navigate virtual environments due to limited feedback. This paper presents a novel augmented reality (AR)-based feedback mechanism, 'VR-Feedback+', which utilizes visual, auditory, and haptic cues to enhance user experience in VR. We conducted a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of VR-Feedback+ and found significant improvements in user satisfaction, task completion time, and spatial awareness compared to traditional VR feedback methods. Our results provide insights into the design of effective feedback mechanisms for VR applications.
