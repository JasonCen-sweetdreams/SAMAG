Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has gained popularity for modeling complex relationships between entities and their attributes. However, existing KGE methods struggle to capture multi-hop reasoning patterns, which are crucial for question answering and recommendation systems. We propose a novel graph attention network (GAT) based KGE framework, 'MultiHopGAT', that learns to focus on relevant entities and relationships during embedding. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to aggregate information from neighboring entities and incorporate meta-paths for more accurate reasoning. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MultiHopGAT outperforms state-of-the-art KGE methods on multi-hop reasoning tasks.
