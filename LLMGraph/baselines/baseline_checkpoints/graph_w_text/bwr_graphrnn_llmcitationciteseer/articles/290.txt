Gesture-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but individuals with motor impairments often face barriers in using these systems. This paper presents an investigation into the design of inclusive gesture-based interfaces that cater to diverse motor abilities. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments, identifying key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of a novel gesture recognition framework, 'IncluGesture', which incorporates adaptive thresholding, gesture segmentation, and machine learning-based gesture classification. Evaluation results demonstrate significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction.
