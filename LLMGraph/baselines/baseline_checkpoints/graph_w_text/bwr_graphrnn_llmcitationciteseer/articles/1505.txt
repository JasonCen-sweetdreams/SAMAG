The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion of time-series data, necessitating efficient indexing techniques for real-time analytics. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'TS-Index', which leverages a combination of symbolic aggregation and piecewise approximation to enable fast query processing. We demonstrate that TS-Index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of storage efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy for common analytical queries. Experiments on real-world IoT datasets validate the efficacy of TS-Index in supporting real-time analytics.
