Object detection is a critical component in autonomous vehicle systems. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention-based YOLO framework, HA-YOLO, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time object detection. HA-YOLO leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant regions of interest, reducing computational complexity while improving detection accuracy. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that HA-YOLO outperforms existing YOLO variants in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness to varying lighting conditions.
