Distributed columnar databases have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'ColumnRush', which leverages machine learning to predict query execution times and optimize query plans. We introduce a column-aware cost model that captures the unique characteristics of columnar storage and develop a reinforcement learning framework to adapt to changing workload patterns. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that ColumnRush reduces average query latency by up to 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art optimizers.
