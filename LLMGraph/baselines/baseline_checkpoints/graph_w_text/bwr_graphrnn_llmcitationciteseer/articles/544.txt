Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph embedding, as it affects the accuracy of subsequent applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical entity disambiguation approach, 'HED-GAT', which leverages graph attention networks to model complex relationships between entities. HED-GAT employs a hierarchical architecture to capture both local and global context, enabling more accurate disambiguation of entities with ambiguous names. Our experiments on the YAGO and DBpedia datasets demonstrate that HED-GAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in entity disambiguation, leading to improved knowledge graph embedding and subsequent question answering performance.
