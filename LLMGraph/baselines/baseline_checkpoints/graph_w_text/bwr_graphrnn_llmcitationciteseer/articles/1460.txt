Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for storing and processing large-scale data. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, called 'GraphOpt', which leverages the structural properties of query graphs to optimize query execution plans. GraphOpt uses a hierarchical indexing scheme to prune unnecessary subqueries and reduce the search space for optimal plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and 2x in terms of resource utilization.
