Query expansion (QE) is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) that aims to enhance the querying process by adding relevant terms to the original query. Traditional QE methods rely on manual feature engineering and often suffer from limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages the power of neural networks to learn effective query representations. Our approach combines a query encoder with a term importance predictor to generate high-quality expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
