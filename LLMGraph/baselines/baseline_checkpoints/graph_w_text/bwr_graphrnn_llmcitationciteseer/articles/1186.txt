Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, aiming to minimize query execution time. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics and exhaustive search, which can be suboptimal and time-consuming. We propose a novel framework, 'DeepQOpt', that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. By modeling the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process, we train a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for selecting the best query plan. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that DeepQOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
