Passage retrieval is a crucial step in many information retrieval applications, but it can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel approach to document representation, called QADE, which learns query-adaptive document embeddings for efficient passage retrieval. QADE uses a neural ranking model to generate query-dependent document representations, allowing for fast and accurate retrieval of relevant passages. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QADE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness, while also providing insights into the importance of query-document interaction for passage retrieval.
