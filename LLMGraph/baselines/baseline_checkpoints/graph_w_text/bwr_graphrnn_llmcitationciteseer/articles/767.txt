Few-shot image classification remains a challenging task, particularly when dealing with limited training data. This paper proposes a novel meta-learning framework, Hierarchical Prototypical Networks (HPN), which leverages hierarchical representations to adapt to new classes. HPN learns to generate class prototypes at multiple scales, enabling more effective knowledge transfer and improved performance on unseen classes. We conduct extensive experiments on popular benchmarks, demonstrating that HPN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image classification tasks.
