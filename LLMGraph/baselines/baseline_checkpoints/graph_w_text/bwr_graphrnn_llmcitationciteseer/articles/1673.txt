Traditional ad-hoc retrieval models rely on dense vector representations of queries, which can lead to suboptimal performance when dealing with sparse or incomplete queries. This paper proposes a novel deep neural retrieval approach, 'SparseQL', that leverages sparse query representations to improve retrieval effectiveness. Our model adapts a graph neural network to learn query-dependent document representations, and incorporates a query-aware sparse attention mechanism to focus on relevant query terms. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness over state-of-the-art models.
