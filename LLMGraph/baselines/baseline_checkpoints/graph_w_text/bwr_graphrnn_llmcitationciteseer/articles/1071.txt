In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that can significantly impact the overall system's performance. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework, 'Dec-TAR', that leverages reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn effective task assignment strategies. Dec-TAR uses a graph neural network to model the agent's local environment and a multi-agent Q-network to learn the optimal task allocation policy. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that Dec-TAR outperforms existing decentralized task allocation methods, achieving an average improvement of 25% in task completion rate and 30% in system utility.
