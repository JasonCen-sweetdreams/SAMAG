Query optimization is a critical component of database systems, and traditional methods rely on heuristics and statistical models. This paper presents a novel approach, 'LIX', which leverages learned index structures to accelerate query optimization for main-memory databases. By integrating neural networks into the query optimizer, LIX can accurately predict query execution times and optimize plans more effectively. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that LIX outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time, while maintaining high accuracy and robustness.
