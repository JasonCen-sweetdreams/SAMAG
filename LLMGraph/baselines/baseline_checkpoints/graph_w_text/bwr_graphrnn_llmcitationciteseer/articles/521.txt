Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern data processing, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based reinforcement learning approach to optimize query plans in distributed databases. Our method, called 'GraphQLearn', represents the database schema as a graph and uses reinforcement learning to learn the optimal query plan based on the query workload and system configuration. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that GraphQLearn outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
