Autonomous systems rely on planning algorithms to accomplish complex tasks. However, the lack of explainability in these algorithms hinders trust and accountability. This paper presents HTN-X, a hierarchical task network framework that integrates planning and explanation generation. HTN-X employs a novel graph-based planning approach that exploits the structural relationships between tasks to produce interpretable plans. We demonstrate HTN-X on a real-world autonomous driving scenario, showcasing its ability to generate transparent and concise explanations for plan execution. Experimental results indicate that HTN-X outperforms state-of-the-art planning methods in terms of plan quality and explanation fidelity.
