Online retrieval of diverse documents is crucial in modern search engines, where users expect relevant and varied results. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'DivRank', which combines the strengths of deep learning and traditional IR techniques to efficiently retrieve diverse documents. DivRank utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global patterns in the document collection, and incorporates a diversity-promoting regularization term to minimize redundancy in the retrieved results. Experimental evaluation on several benchmark datasets demonstrates the superiority of DivRank over state-of-the-art methods in terms of both retrieval efficiency and result diversity.
