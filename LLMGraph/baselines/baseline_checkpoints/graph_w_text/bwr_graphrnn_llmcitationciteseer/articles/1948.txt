Distributed information retrieval (IR) systems face the challenge of efficient query processing across multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel co-indexing technique that leverages the structure of the underlying data to reduce query latency and improve system throughput. By partitioning the index into smaller, interconnected components, our approach enables parallel query processing and minimizes inter-node communication. Experimental results on a large-scale IR dataset demonstrate that our co-indexing method achieves significant performance gains over traditional distributed indexing techniques, making it suitable for real-time query processing in modern IR systems.
