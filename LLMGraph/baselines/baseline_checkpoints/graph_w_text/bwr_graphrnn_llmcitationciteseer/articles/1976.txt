Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, but traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and heuristics. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using reinforcement learning (RL), where an agent learns to select the most informative expansion terms by interacting with the retrieval environment. We propose a reward function that incorporates both relevance and diversity metrics, and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance on several benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that the RL-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including those based on word embeddings and topic models.
