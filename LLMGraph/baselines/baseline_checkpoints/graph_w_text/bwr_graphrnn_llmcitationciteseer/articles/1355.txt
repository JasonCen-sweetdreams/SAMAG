Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but individuals with hearing impairments often struggle to interact with them effectively. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EasyListen', a voice assistant tailored to the needs of older adults with hearing impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and developed novel audio processing techniques to enhance speech intelligibility. Our results show that EasyListen improves the overall user experience, reducing errors and increasing user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants. We discuss the implications of our findings for designing more inclusive voice interfaces.
