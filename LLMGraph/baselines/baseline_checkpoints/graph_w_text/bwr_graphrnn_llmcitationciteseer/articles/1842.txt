Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources to meet dynamic workload demands. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, 'CloudOptimizer', which learns to adaptively allocate resources based on real-time workload patterns. We design a novel reward function that incorporates both performance and energy efficiency metrics, and demonstrate that CloudOptimizer outperforms traditional rule-based allocation methods in terms of response time and resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world cloud dataset show that CloudOptimizer achieves up to 30% reduction in energy consumption and 25% improvement in response time compared to baseline methods.
