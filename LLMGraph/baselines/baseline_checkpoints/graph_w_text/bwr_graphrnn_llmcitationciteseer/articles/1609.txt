Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes an adaptive data replication strategy that dynamically adjusts data placement based on query patterns and system workload. Our approach leverages machine learning-based query prediction and a cost-benefit analysis to determine the optimal data replication scheme. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 35% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in network traffic compared to existing static replication strategies.
