We propose a novel decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, leveraging distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) techniques. Our approach, called AgentTA, enables agents to dynamically allocate tasks while respecting constraints on resource availability, communication range, and agent capabilities. We develop a gossip-based protocol that allows agents to iteratively refine their task assignments, leading to improved system-wide efficiency and scalability. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that AgentTA outperforms existing centralized and distributed task allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization.
