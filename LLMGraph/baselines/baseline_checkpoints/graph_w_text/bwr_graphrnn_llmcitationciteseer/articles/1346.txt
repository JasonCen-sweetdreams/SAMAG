Multi-agent systems often encounter conflicts that hinder their collective performance. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous conflict resolution using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized conflict resolution framework, 'ACR-DRL', where agents learn to negotiate and resolve conflicts through a combination of deep Q-networks and graph neural networks. Our approach is evaluated in a simulated traffic management scenario, where ACR-DRL achieves a 35% reduction in conflict frequency compared to traditional rule-based methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of our algorithm.
