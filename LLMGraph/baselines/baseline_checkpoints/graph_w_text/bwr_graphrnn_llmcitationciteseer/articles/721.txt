Distributed database systems (DDS) are widely used in modern applications, but query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes an adaptive replication strategy, 'AdaRep', that dynamically adjusts data replication based on query patterns and system workloads. We develop a cost model that incorporates query frequency, data access patterns, and network latency to determine optimal replication configurations. Experimental results on a real-world DDS deployment show that AdaRep improves query response times by up to 35% and reduces average query latency by 20% compared to traditional static replication schemes.
