Virtual reality (VR) has shown promising results in enhancing learning experiences, but user engagement remains a crucial challenge. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR-based learning environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a customized avatar that reflected their physical appearance, interests, and learning style. Our results indicate that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, motivation, and overall learning outcomes compared to generic avatars. We also identify key factors influencing user-avatar bonding, including avatar likability, realism, and agency. These findings have implications for the design of immersive learning systems that leverage personalized avatars to facilitate deeper user involvement.
