Distributed graph databases are increasingly used in modern applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel learning-based indexing approach, 'GraphLIX', which leverages machine learning models to predict query patterns and optimize index creation. We develop a graph neural network (GNN) that learns to identify frequent query subgraphs and generates adaptive indexing strategies. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphLIX reduces query latency by up to 3x and improves index creation time by 2x compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
