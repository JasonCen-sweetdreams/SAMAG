Voice-based assistants, such as Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, have become increasingly popular, but their ability to personalize responses remains limited. This study explores the effects of personalization on user engagement in voice-based assistants. We designed and implemented a personalized conversational agent that incorporates user preferences, habits, and context into its responses. Our user study (N=100) revealed that personalized responses significantly improve user satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and overall engagement. We also analyzed the linguistic features of user interactions and found that personalized agents elicit more conversational and exploratory user behavior.
