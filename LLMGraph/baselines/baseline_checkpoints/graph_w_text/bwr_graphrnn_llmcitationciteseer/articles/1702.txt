Real-time data warehousing is becoming increasingly important in today's fast-paced business environments. However, optimizing queries for real-time analytics remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization technique that leverages column store indexing to improve query performance. We introduce a cost-based optimization framework that takes into account the unique characteristics of column store indexes and real-time data warehousing workloads. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance gains over traditional query optimization techniques, with an average query speedup of 3.2x.
