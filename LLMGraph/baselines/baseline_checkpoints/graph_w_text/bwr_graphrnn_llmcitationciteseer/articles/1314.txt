Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data. However, query performance remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of query processing across multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Query Rewriting (HQR) framework that optimizes query execution in DIR systems. HQR employs a hierarchical clustering approach to group nodes based on their data distributions, and rewrites queries to minimize communication overhead. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HQR achieves significant improvements in query response time and reduces network traffic by up to 30% compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
