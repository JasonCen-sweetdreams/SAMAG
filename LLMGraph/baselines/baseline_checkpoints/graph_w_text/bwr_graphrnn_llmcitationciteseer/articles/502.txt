Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and cybersecurity. However, most existing methods suffer from a lack of interpretability, making it challenging to understand the underlying causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) framework, which integrates both local and global attention mechanisms to identify anomalies in time series data. Our approach enables the identification of relevant features and time segments contributing to anomaly detection, thereby providing explainability. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability.
