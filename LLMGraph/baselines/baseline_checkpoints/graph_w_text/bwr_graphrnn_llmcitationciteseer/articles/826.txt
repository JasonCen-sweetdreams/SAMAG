Multi-agent pathfinding is a complex problem in AI, particularly in scenarios with large numbers of agents and dynamic environments. This paper presents a novel approach that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) with hierarchical planning to efficiently solve MAPF problems. Our method, called GNN-HP, uses GNNs to learn agent representations and graph embeddings, which are then used to guide a hierarchical planner to find near-optimal solutions. Experimental results on various benchmark scenarios demonstrate that GNN-HP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of solution quality and computation time, making it a promising approach for real-world applications.
