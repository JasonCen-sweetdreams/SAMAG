Main-memory column stores have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics, but efficient indexing for range queries remains a significant challenge. Existing solutions often rely on traditional B-tree indexes, which can lead to poor performance due to the high storage overhead and limited cache efficiency. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'Ridge', which leverages the columnar storage layout to create a compact, cache-friendly index. Ridge uses a combination of bit-vector compression andSIMD instructions to accelerate range query processing. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that Ridge outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 5x in query performance while reducing memory usage by 30%.
