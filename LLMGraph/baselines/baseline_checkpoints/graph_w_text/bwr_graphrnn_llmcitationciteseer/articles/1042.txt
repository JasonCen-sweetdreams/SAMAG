Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but users with disabilities often face barriers to immersion. This paper presents 'HapAxis', a novel framework for adaptive haptic feedback in VR. HapAxis leverages machine learning to dynamically adjust vibration intensity, frequency, and pattern based on user preferences, task requirements, and real-time biometric feedback. Our user study with 30 participants, including individuals with visual and motor impairments, demonstrates significant improvements in task performance, user satisfaction, and overall accessibility. The HapAxis framework can be integrated into existing VR systems, enhancing the inclusive potential of VR technology.
