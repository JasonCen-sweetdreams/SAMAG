Task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities must be assigned to tasks to optimize system performance. This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized architecture where each agent learns to allocate tasks based on its local observations and interactions with other agents. Our algorithm, 'DeepTASK', leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and deep Q-networks to learn task allocation policies. We evaluate DeepTASK on a simulated multi-agent system and demonstrate significant improvements in system efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional optimization-based approaches.
