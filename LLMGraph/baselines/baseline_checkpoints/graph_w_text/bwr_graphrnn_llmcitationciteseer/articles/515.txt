Query expansion is a crucial component of modern search engines, as it helps disambiguate user queries and improve retrieval effectiveness. This paper presents a novel context-aware embedding approach, dubbed 'CAE-QE', which leverages both semantic and syntactic information to generate high-quality expansion terms. Our method integrates a graph-based neural network with a contextualized language model to capture nuanced relationships between query terms and their surroundings. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, especially for ambiguous and OCR-error-prone queries, when compared to state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
