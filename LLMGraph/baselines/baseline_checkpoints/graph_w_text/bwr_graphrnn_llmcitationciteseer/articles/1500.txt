Conversational interfaces, such as voice assistants and chatbots, have become increasingly prevalent in our daily lives. However, people with disabilities often face significant barriers in using these systems due to limitations in current design practices. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for designing inclusive conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of individuals with disabilities. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving user interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify key accessibility challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed framework incorporates adaptive dialogue management, multimodal output, and personalized feedback mechanisms to enhance the user experience for people with disabilities.
