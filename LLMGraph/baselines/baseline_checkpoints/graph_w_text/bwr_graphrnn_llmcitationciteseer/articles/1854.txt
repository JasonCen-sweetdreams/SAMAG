This paper proposes a novel approach to resource allocation in smart grids by coordinating autonomous agents through distributed negotiation. We develop a multi-agent system where agents representing different stakeholders (e.g., households, utilities, and renewable energy sources) negotiate over resource allocation to optimize energy efficiency and reduce costs. Our approach leverages semantic reasoning and machine learning to enable agents to learn from their interactions and adapt to changing grid conditions. Experimental results demonstrate improved resource allocation and reduced energy waste compared to traditional centralized optimization methods.
