This paper presents a novel neural re-ranking approach for document retrieval, which leverages query expansion to improve the accuracy of search results. Our method, dubbed 'NeuRank', employs a deep neural network to learn a semantic representation of queries and documents, and then re-ranks the initial retrieval results based on their relevance scores. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuRank outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving significant improvements in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
