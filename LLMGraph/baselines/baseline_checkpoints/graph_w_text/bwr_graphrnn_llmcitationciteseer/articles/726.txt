In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and preferences need to be assigned to tasks with different requirements and rewards. We design a novel auction mechanism that incorporates deep reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn bid strategies and adapt to changing task environments. Our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate, resource utilization, and overall system efficiency, as demonstrated through extensive simulations on a variety of scenarios.
