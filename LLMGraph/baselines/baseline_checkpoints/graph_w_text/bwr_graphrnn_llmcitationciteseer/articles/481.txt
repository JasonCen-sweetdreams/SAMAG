Modern column-store databases are optimized for analytical workloads, but query optimization remains a bottleneck for real-time analytics. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'Raptor', which leverages machine learning models to predict optimal join orders and indexing strategies. We introduce a cost-based optimization algorithm that integrates with the Raptor framework to minimize query latency. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves an average speedup of 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers, making it suitable for real-time analytics applications.
