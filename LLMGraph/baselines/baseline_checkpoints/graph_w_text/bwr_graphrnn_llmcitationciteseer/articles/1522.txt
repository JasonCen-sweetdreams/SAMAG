Individuals with dyslexia often face challenges in reading and writing, which can negatively impact their daily lives. This paper presents a novel multimodal assistive system, 'DysRead', that leverages computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning to provide personalized support for users with dyslexia. DysRead incorporates a real-time text recognition module, a grammar and spell checker, and a reading assistant that adapts to the user's reading speed and accuracy. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that DysRead significantly improved their reading comprehension and writing accuracy compared to traditional assistive tools.
