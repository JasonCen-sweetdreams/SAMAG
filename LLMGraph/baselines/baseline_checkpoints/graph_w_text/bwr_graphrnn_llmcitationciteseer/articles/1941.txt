Multi-agent systems have numerous applications in areas like robotics, traffic control, and smart grids. However, as the number of agents increases, the complexity of cooperation strategies grows exponentially. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) architecture for scalable multi-agent cooperation. Our approach leverages graph attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, while hierarchical pooling enables efficient information aggregation across different spatial and temporal scales. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks demonstrate that HGAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of cooperation efficiency and adaptability to changing environments.
