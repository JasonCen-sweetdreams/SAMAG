Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in Information Retrieval (IR). This paper presents a novel approach, 'HierGAT', which leverages hierarchical graph attention to model complex document-query relationships. We propose a deep relevance matching framework that captures both local and global dependencies between entities, phrases, and sentences in the query and document graphs. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art neural ranking models, particularly in cases with limited training data.
