This study examines the potential of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to alleviate cognitive load in older adults during human-computer interactions. We designed an ECA-based interface that utilizes gestures, facial expressions, and vocal cues to facilitate comprehension and engagement. Our user study involved 30 older adults completing a series of cognitively demanding tasks with and without the ECA interface. Results show significant reductions in cognitive load, measured through eye-tracking and self-reported surveys, when the ECA interface was used. Our findings have implications for the design of accessible and inclusive interfaces for older adults.
