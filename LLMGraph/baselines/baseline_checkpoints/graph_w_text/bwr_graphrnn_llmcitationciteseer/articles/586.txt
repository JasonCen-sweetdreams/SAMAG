Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries on these databases remains a challenging problem due to the inherent complexity of graph data and the distributed nature of the system. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning. We present a framework that learns to optimize queries by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world graph dataset shows that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
