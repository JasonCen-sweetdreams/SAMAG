Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent due to the ambiguity of query terms. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach that leverages graph-based word embeddings to model semantic relationships between words. Our method, GraphExpan, constructs a weighted graph of co-occurring terms in the query and then applies a random walk-based algorithm to generate expanded queries. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate that GraphExpan outperforms traditional methods, such as Rocchio's algorithm, in terms of mean average precision and recall.
