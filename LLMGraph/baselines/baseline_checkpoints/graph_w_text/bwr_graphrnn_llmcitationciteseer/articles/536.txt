Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience and engagement in VR. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, employing a mixed-methods approach to investigate the impact of avatar personalization on user immersion, satisfaction, and behavioral intention. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, reported greater sense of presence, and demonstrated increased willingness to continue using VR. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR systems and highlight avenues for future research.
