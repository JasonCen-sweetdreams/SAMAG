Ad-hoc search systems rely on accurate query document matching to retrieve relevant documents. This paper presents a neural retrieval model, 'QRN', which leverages a novel query-aware document encoding scheme to improve matching efficiency. QRN uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to focus on salient query terms and document segments, enabling fast and effective retrieval. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that QRN outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision while reducing query latency by 30%.
