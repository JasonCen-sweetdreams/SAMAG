Patent retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of complex queries, leading to suboptimal results. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion, 'SemExpan', which leverages semantic embeddings to better capture the context and intent behind user queries. By incorporating pre-trained language models and domain-specific knowledge graphs, SemExpan generates more informative and relevant expansion terms, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on a large patent corpus demonstrate significant gains in precision and recall compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
