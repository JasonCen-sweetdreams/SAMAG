Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to rank documents in response to a user query. While neural models have shown promise in this area, they often rely on expensive query-document interaction mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel approach, Neural Query Graphs (NQG), which represents queries as graphs and leverages graph neural networks to learn efficient document ranking. NQG significantly reduces the computational cost of query-document interactions while achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. We also explore the interpretability of NQG, demonstrating that the learned query graphs capture meaningful semantic relationships between query terms.
