The proliferation of online documents has made efficient document ranking crucial for information retrieval systems. Existing methods rely on handcrafted features or simple graph-based models, which struggle to capture complex relationships between documents. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) for document ranking. HGAT leverages graph attention mechanisms to model document relationships at multiple scales, from individual keywords to hierarchical topic structures. Experimental results on the TREC-8 benchmark demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of nDCG@10 and MAP metrics, while reducing computational complexity.
