Recommender systems have become increasingly complex, with large user-item graphs and cold start problems. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture that efficiently captures long-range dependencies and node relationships. We introduce a hierarchical pooling mechanism that aggregates node features at multiple scales, enabling accurate and scalable recommendation generation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in recall and precision over state-of-the-art graph-based methods, with reduced computational overhead.
