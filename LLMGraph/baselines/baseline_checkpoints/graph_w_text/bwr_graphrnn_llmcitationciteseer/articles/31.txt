Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to balance precision and recall, particularly when users submit short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. We demonstrate that DeepQE can effectively capture contextual dependencies and generate high-quality expansion terms, leading to significant improvements in retrieval performance. Our experiments on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval benchmark show that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, particularly for short and noisy queries.
