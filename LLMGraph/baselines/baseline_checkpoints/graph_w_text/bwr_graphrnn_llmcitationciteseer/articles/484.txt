Human pose estimation is a crucial component in autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars and robots, for understanding human behavior and intentions. This paper presents a novel real-time human pose estimation framework, 'PoseGAN', which leverages graph attention networks to model the complex relationships between body joints. PoseGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, outperforming traditional CNN-based methods in terms of accuracy and speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PoseGAN in a real-world autonomous driving scenario, enabling the system to accurately detect and respond to pedestrian movements.
