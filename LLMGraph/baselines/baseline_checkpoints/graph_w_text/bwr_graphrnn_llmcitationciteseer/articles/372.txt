As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, there is a growing need for more natural and efficient human-computer interaction methods. This paper explores the use of gaze-based interaction in AR, focusing on the analysis of eye movement patterns. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, collecting eye-tracking data and subjective feedback on various gaze-based interaction techniques. Our results show that a combination of dwell-time and gaze-direction-based selection outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. We also identify key challenges and opportunities for future research in this area.
