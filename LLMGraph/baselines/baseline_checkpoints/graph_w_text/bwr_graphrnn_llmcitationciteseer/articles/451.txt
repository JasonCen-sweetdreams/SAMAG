Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but existing methods often rely on simplistic term-weighting schemes and ignore the hierarchical structure of documents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation framework, 'HiDER', which captures both local and global context information. By leveraging a graph-based neural network to encode document hierarchies, HiDER enables more effective query expansion and improves retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HiDER over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
