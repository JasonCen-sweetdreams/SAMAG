Gesture recognition is a crucial aspect of human-computer interaction in virtual reality (VR) environments. While advances in machine learning have improved recognition accuracy, the impact of embodiment on gesture recognition remains understudied. This paper presents an empirical study examining the effect of embodiment on gesture recognition in VR. We conducted a user study with 40 participants, manipulating the level of embodiment in a VR-based gesture recognition task. Our results show that increased embodiment significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy, particularly for complex gestures. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more effective and intuitive VR-based interfaces.
