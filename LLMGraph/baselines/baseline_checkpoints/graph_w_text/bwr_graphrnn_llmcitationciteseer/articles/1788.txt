Traditional document retrieval systems rely on bag-of-words representations, which fail to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and document contents. This paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Semantic Embeddings for Retrieval (HSE-R), which leverages hierarchical semantic graphs to learn dense vector representations of documents and queries. HSE-R outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and efficiency. We also propose a novel query expansion technique that adaptively incorporates semantic context from the hierarchical graph, further enhancing performance.
