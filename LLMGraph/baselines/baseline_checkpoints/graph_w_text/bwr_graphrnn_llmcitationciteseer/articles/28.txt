Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle with query ambiguity, leading to suboptimal document ranking. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE-DF', which leverages term co-occurrence patterns to disambiguate queries and improve filtering efficiency. By representing queries as hierarchical graphs, HQE-DF effectively captures semantic relationships between terms and documents, enabling more accurate filtering of irrelevant documents. Our experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in mean average precision and filtering effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
