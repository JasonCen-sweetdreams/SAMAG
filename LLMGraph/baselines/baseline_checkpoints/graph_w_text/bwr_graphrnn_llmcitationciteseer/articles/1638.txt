In multi-agent systems, decision-making often relies on complex interactions between agents. While deep reinforcement learning has shown promise in this domain, interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces HAN-MAD, a hierarchical attention network that learns to selectively focus on relevant agents and their interactions, leading to more explainable decision-making. We evaluate HAN-MAD on a suite of cooperative and competitive multi-agent tasks, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
