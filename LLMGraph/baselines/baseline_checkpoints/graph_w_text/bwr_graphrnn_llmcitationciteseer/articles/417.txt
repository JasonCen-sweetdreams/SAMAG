In-memory databases have become increasingly popular for real-time analytics, but their memory-bound nature makes data pruning crucial for performance. This paper presents a novel pruning approach, 'ColPrune', specifically designed for column-oriented in-memory databases. ColPrune leverages statistical correlation analysis to identify and eliminate redundant data columns, reducing memory footprint while preserving query accuracy. We evaluate ColPrune on a suite of real-world benchmarks, demonstrating up to 40% memory savings and 20% query performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art pruning techniques.
