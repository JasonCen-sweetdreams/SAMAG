Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts query performance and system scalability. While traditional query optimizers rely on heuristics and rule-based approaches, we propose a novel reinforcement learning-based framework, 'RL-QOpt', that learns to optimize query plans in a distributed setting. RL-QOpt utilizes a deep Q-network to estimate the expected execution cost of query plans and adaptively searches for optimal plans. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database system demonstrates that RL-QOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving up to 3x speedup on complex queries.
