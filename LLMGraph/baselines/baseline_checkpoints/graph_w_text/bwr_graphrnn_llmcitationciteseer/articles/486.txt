Individuals with motor impairments often face challenges when interacting with digital systems. This paper presents a novel framework for designing adaptive gesture-based interfaces that can accommodate users with varying levels of motor ability. Our approach leverages machine learning-based gesture recognition and real-time adaptation to provide personalized interaction experiences. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in interaction accuracy and user satisfaction. The proposed framework has implications for enhancing accessibility in various applications, including gaming, virtual reality, and healthcare.
