Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives, but existing gesture recognition systems often fail to accommodate users with disabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to personalized gesture recognition, leveraging a combination of machine learning and computer vision techniques. Our system, ' GestureFit', uses a wearable sensor array to capture user gestures and adapts to individual movement patterns, enabling more accurate and inclusive VR experiences. We evaluate GestureFit on a dataset of users with varying abilities, demonstrating significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction.
