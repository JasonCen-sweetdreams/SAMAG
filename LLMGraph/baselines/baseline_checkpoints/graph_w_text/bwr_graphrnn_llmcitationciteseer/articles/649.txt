This paper addresses the problem of distributed task allocation in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities and resources need to cooperate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a novel approach based on heuristic-based coalition formation, which leverages graph theory and machine learning to identify optimal coalitions of agents for task allocation. Our approach is evaluated using a simulated environment and shows significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization compared to existing decentralized task allocation methods.
