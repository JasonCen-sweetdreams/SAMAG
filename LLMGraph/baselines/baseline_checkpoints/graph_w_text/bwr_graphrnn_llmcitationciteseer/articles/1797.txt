This paper addresses the problem of hierarchical task network planning for multi-agent systems in partially observable environments. We propose a novel planning framework that integrates belief space planning with hierarchical task decomposition. Our approach enables agents to reason about incomplete information and adapt to changing environmental conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in a simulated search and rescue scenario, where our system outperforms existing planning methods in terms of mission success rate and robustness to uncertainty.
