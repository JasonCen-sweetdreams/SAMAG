Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant answers. However, the lexical gap between questions and passages often hinders accurate retrieval. This paper introduces DPRF, a novel deep query reformulation framework that learns to paraphrase questions into more effective search queries. DPRF leverages a hierarchical encoder to capture contextual relationships between question words and incorporates a reinforcement learning objective to optimize retrieval performance. Experimental results on theNatural Questions benchmark demonstrate that DPRF improves passage retrieval accuracy by 12.3% and reduces the number of required passages by 30.5%, leading to significant speedups in ODQA systems.
