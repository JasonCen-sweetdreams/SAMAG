Distributed column stores have become increasingly popular for large-scale data analytics. However, optimizing query execution plans for these systems remains a complex problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans for distributed column stores. We design a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that learns to predict optimal join orders and data placement strategies based on query patterns and system metrics. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate a significant reduction in query latency and improved resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
