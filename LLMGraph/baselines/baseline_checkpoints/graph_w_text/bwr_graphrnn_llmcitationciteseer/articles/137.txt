Traditional document retrieval systems rely on simplistic bag-of-words representations, neglecting the rich contextual relationships within documents. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that captures both local and global contextual dependencies in document graphs. Our model learns to attend to salient entities, concepts, and relationships, yielding improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and WikiQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in retrieving relevant documents, outperforming state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
