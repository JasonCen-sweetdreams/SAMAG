In this paper, we present a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems. Our approach leverages reinforcement learning to enable agents to learn optimal task assignment strategies in real-time. We introduce a graph-based representation of the agent-task interaction space, which allows agents to share information and coordinate their actions. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving efficient task allocation and improved system performance. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method, showing its convergence properties and robustness to agent failures.
