Traditional ranking models in information retrieval (IR) often neglect the contextual information of the query. This paper proposes a novel hybrid ranking model, 'HybridRank', which integrates both semantic and contextual features to improve the accuracy of document retrieval. We employ a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query-document relevance and query-context similarity. Experimental results on the TREC-NEWS dataset show that HybridRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
