Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches struggle with scalability and real-time performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'EDIN', which leverages a combination of graph-based and machine learning-based methods to efficiently resolve entity ambiguities. Our approach exploits the structural properties of knowledge graphs to prune the search space and employs a learned ranking model to prioritize candidate entities. Experimental results on large-scale knowledge graphs demonstrate that EDIN achieves an average speedup of 3.5x over state-of-the-art disambiguation methods while maintaining high accuracy.
