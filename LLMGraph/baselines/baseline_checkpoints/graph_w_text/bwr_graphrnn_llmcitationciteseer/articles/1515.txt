Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) systems are critical for efficient search and retrieval in large-scale datasets. However, the query processing time in DIR systems can be significantly high due to the overhead of communication among nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach to reduce the query processing time in DIR systems. Our approach leverages the inherent structure of the data to create a hierarchical index, which enables efficient query routing and reduces the number of nodes involved in query processing. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves an average query processing time reduction of 35% compared to state-of-the-art DIR systems.
