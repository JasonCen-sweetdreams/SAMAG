Query expansion (QE) is a widely used technique in ad-hoc retrieval to improve the retrieval performance. However, existing QE methods often rely on simple term co-occurrence or frequency-based approaches, which may not capture complex keyword correlations. This paper proposes a graph-based keyword correlation model (GKC) that leverages graph convolutional networks to learn dense keyword representations. GKC outperforms traditional QE methods by 12.3% in terms of mean average precision on the TREC-8 dataset. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of GKC in handling keyword ambiguity and polysemy.
