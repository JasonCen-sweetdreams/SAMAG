Conversational agents are increasingly being used in educational and therapeutic settings, but their design often neglects the needs and perspectives of children. This paper presents a co-design methodology that engages children in the design of conversational agents, focusing on inclusive play experiences. We conducted a series of workshops with children aged 8-12, using participatory design techniques to elicit their ideas and preferences for conversational agents. Our findings highlight the importance of emotional intelligence, playfulness, and adaptability in agents, and inform the development of a novel agent architecture that incorporates these features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study on a conversational agent for children with autism.
