Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion, leveraging contextualized word embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. Our model, CQE, integrates BERT-based embeddings with a graph-based ranking algorithm to select the most informative expansion terms. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that CQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of MAP, P@10, and nDCG, while reducing the computational overhead associated with traditional query expansion techniques.
