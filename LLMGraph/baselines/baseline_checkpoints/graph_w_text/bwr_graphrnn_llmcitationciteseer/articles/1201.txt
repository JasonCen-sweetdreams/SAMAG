Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to enhance the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing VR systems often fail to accommodate their unique needs. This paper presents a participatory design approach to create inclusive VR experiences for this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and clinicians to identify key accessibility barriers and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a novel VR framework, 'EmpathVR', which incorporates cognitive support features, such as simplified interfaces and audio cues, to facilitate engagement and enjoyment. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrates improved user experience and cognitive engagement compared to existing VR systems.
