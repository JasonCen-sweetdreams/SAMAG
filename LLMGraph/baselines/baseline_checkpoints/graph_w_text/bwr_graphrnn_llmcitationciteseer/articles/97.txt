E-commerce search engines rely on query expansion to retrieve relevant products. Traditional methods employ hand-crafted rules or statistical models, which can be limited by their simplicity. This paper proposes a deep neural network-based approach, 'DeepQE', which learns to expand queries by capturing semantic relationships between words and product attributes. Our experiments on a large e-commerce dataset show that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall, while reducing computational overhead. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of DeepQE in handling out-of-vocabulary queries and cold-start products.
