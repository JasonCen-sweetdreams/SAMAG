Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it can significantly impact the relevance and ranking of retrieved documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep graph embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method, dubbed GraphQE, represents the query and document graph as a heterogeneous graph, and then applies a graph neural network to learn dense embeddings. These embeddings are used to expand the original query with relevant terms, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, especially in scenarios with limited query context.
