Virtual reality (VR) has immense potential for immersive experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to designing emotive avatars that simulate human-like emotions, thereby increasing user empathy and participation. We propose an affective computing framework that integrates facial expression recognition, sentiment analysis, and machine learning-based emotional state modeling. Our user study with 30 participants demonstrates that emotive avatars significantly enhance user engagement, with a 35% increase in self-reported emotional connection and a 25% increase in task completion rates.
