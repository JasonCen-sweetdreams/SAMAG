Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create inclusive conversational interfaces tailored to this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 20 older adults with cognitive impairments, identifying key challenges and preferences in interacting with conversational systems. Our findings inform the development of a novel interface framework, 'EasyChat', which incorporates features such as simplified language, visual cues, and error tolerance. A usability evaluation with 15 participants demonstrates improved engagement and task completion rates using EasyChat compared to a standard conversational interface.
