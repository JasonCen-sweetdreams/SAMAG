This paper presents a novel approach to document ranking for information retrieval using deep neural networks. Our proposed method, 'DeepRank', leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to learn a robust ranking function that can capture complex contextual relationships between query terms and document content. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepRank outperforms state-of-the-art learning-to-rank models in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the model's performance on different types of queries and document collections.
