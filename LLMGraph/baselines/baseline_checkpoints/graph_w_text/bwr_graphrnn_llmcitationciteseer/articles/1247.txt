Graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art performance in node classification tasks, but they struggle to capture temporal dependencies in dynamic networks. We propose a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that incorporates attention mechanisms at both node and graph levels to model temporal and spatial relationships. Our experiments on several real-world dynamic network datasets demonstrate that HGAN outperforms existing methods in node classification tasks, especially in scenarios with rapidly changing graph structures.
