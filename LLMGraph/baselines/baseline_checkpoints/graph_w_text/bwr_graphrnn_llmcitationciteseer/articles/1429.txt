Decentralized task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a novel approach using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to learn decentralized task allocation policies. We introduce a hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) to model agent-agent and agent-task interactions, and a decentralized Q-learning algorithm to learn optimal task allocation strategies. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized methods and achieves near-optimal performance compared to centralized solutions.
