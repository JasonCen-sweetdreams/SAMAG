Neural information retrieval (NIR) models have recently shown promise in improving search engine rankings. However, they often struggle with query-document mismatch, where the query terms do not appear in the relevant documents. We propose a novel query-adaptive document expansion (QADE) approach, which generates synthetic documents that incorporate latent semantic knowledge from the query. Our method leverages a transformer-based architecture to dynamically generate expansion terms, conditioned on the query context. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness, especially for queries with limited term overlap.
