This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents possess different capabilities and expertise. We leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task assignments, capturing complex dependencies and interactions between agents and tasks. Our approach, termed 'GNN-Allocator', is designed to operate in real-time, adapting to changing task requirements and agent availability. Experimental results demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing decentralized allocation methods, showcasing the potential of GNN-based approaches in large-scale multi-agent systems.
