This paper presents a multimodal approach to designing voice-based interfaces that cater to the needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, exploring the impact of cognitive decline on voice interaction. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating visual and tactile feedback to compensate for declining auditory abilities. We propose a novel interface framework, 'VoiceAssist', which leverages machine learning-based speech recognition, gaze-tracking, and haptic feedback to facilitate intuitive communication. A usability evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to conventional voice assistants.
