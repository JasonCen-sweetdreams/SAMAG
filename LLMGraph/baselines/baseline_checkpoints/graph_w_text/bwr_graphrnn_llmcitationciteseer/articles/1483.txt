Distributed column stores have become popular for real-time analytics due to their high storage capacity and query performance. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task, particularly when dealing with complex queries and large datasets. This paper presents 'ColOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and statistical models to predict optimal query plans. We propose a hybrid approach that combines cost-based optimization with machine learning-based models to adapt to changing data distributions and query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that ColOpt achieves an average query performance improvement of 30% compared to existing optimization techniques.
