High-dimensional data is becoming increasingly common in various applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and scientific simulations. However, indexing such data in distributed database systems poses significant challenges. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'HDIX', which leverages the inherent correlations between dimensions to reduce the indexing overhead. We demonstrate that HDIX outperforms existing indexing methods, such as R-trees and ball-trees, in terms of query performance and storage efficiency. Our experiments on a real-world dataset show that HDIX achieves up to 3x speedup in query response time and 2x reduction in storage requirements.
