Real-time database systems require efficient concurrency control mechanisms to ensure predictable and timely transaction processing. Traditional locking-based approaches can lead to performance bottlenecks and increased latency. This paper proposes a novel adaptive transaction scheduling framework, 'ARTS', which leverages machine learning-based predictive modeling to dynamically adjust transaction priorities and resource allocation. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world industrial control system dataset demonstrates that ARTS outperforms state-of-the-art concurrency control algorithms in terms of throughput, latency, and fairness.
