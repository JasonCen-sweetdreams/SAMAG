Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results in node classification tasks, but their scalability remains a major challenge. This paper presents H-GCN, a hierarchical graph neural network architecture that leverages a novel graph coarsening technique to reduce the computational complexity of GNNs. We demonstrate that H-GCN can efficiently process large-scale graphs with millions of nodes, while maintaining competitive performance with existing methods. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that H-GCN outperforms existing GNN architectures in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
