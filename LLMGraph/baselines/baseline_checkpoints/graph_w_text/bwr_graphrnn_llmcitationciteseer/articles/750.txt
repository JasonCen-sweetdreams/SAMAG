The increasing adoption of RDF as a data representation standard has led to a growing need for efficient querying mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing framework, 'RDFlex', designed to accelerate RDF query processing on large-scale datasets. RDFlex combines a graph-based indexing approach with a hierarchical clustering technique, enabling fast query optimization and efficient join processing. We evaluate RDFlex on several real-world RDF datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing state-of-the-art indexing methods.
