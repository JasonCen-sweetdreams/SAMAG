Query optimization is a critical component of database systems, but traditional cost-based optimization techniques can be ineffective in distributed database settings. This paper explores the application of learned index structures to accelerate query optimization in distributed databases. We propose a novel framework, 'Lido', which leverages machine learning models to predict query execution times and optimize query plans. Experiments on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate that Lido outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time, while reducing optimization overhead by up to 50%.
