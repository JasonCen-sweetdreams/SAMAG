Modern search engines face the challenge of efficiently indexing and ranking a vast, constantly evolving corpus of documents. This paper introduces ElasticRank, a novel ranking framework that adapts to changing query patterns and document updates in real-time. By leveraging a hierarchical indexing structure and a probabilistic query modeling approach, ElasticRank achieves a 30% improvement in query throughput and a 25% reduction in indexing latency compared to state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate ElasticRank on a large-scale web crawl dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in handling sudden changes in query popularity.
