This paper presents a novel agent-based framework for adaptive resource allocation in distributed systems. Our approach leverages autonomous agents to dynamically allocate resources based on real-time system monitoring and prediction. We propose a novel decentralized coordination mechanism that enables agents to adapt to changing system conditions, ensuring efficient resource utilization and improved system performance. Experimental results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach in various distributed system scenarios.
