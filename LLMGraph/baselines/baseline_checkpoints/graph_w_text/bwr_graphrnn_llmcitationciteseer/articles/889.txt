Neural search engines have gained popularity in recent years, but their performance is often hindered by the quality of the query. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using attention-based keyword extraction. Our method, called AttentiveQE, selectively incorporates keywords from the top-ranked documents to reformulate the query. We employ a neural network to learn the attention weights, which enables the model to focus on the most relevant keywords. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that AttentiveQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
