Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of dynamically allocating resources to meet fluctuating user demand. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARLA', which enables autonomous agents to learn and adapt to changing resource requirements. MARLA employs a decentralized, auction-based mechanism to allocate resources, and incorporates a novel reward function that balances resource utilization with latency and cost considerations. Experimental results demonstrate that MARLA outperforms traditional static allocation methods in terms of resource efficiency, response time, and cost savings.
