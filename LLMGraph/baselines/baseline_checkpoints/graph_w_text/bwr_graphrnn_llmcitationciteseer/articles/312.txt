Distributed database systems face significant performance challenges due to data partitioning and replication. This paper presents an adaptive indexing technique, 'DynIndex', that dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distributions. DynIndex utilizes a cost-benefit analysis to select the most effective indexing strategy for each query, minimizing overhead while maximizing query performance. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database demonstrate that DynIndex achieves up to 3x improvement in query response time compared to traditional static indexing approaches.
