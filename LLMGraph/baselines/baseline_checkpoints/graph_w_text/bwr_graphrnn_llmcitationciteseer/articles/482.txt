Microblogging platforms generate vast amounts of short-form text data, posing significant challenges for information retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages both semantic and syntactic features of short-text queries to improve retrieval effectiveness. CAQE incorporates a graph-based method to model the relationships between entities, topics, and keywords, and applies a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the query expansion process. Experimental results on a large-scale Twitter dataset demonstrate that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
