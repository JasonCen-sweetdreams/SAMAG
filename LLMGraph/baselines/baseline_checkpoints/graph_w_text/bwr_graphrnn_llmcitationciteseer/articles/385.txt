Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) enables timely analytics and decision-making, but query processing efficiency remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes 'AdapIndex', a novel adaptive indexing technique that dynamically adjusts to query patterns and data distributions in RTDW systems. AdapIndex combines machine learning-based prediction models with incremental indexing to minimize index maintenance costs. Experimental evaluation on a large-scale RTDW benchmark demonstrates that AdapIndex reduces query latency by up to 40% and improves indexing efficiency by 25% compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods.
