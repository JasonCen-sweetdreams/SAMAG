Entity disambiguation in knowledge graphs is a challenging task, especially when dealing with ambiguous entities with similar names. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach that incorporates semantic relationships and entity co-occurrences to disambiguate entities. Our approach, called CAQE, leverages graph-based attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of contextual entities and expand the query with relevant keywords. Experimental results on the DBpedia dataset show that CAQE outperforms state-of-the-art entity disambiguation methods, achieving an average precision of 0.92 and recall of 0.88.
