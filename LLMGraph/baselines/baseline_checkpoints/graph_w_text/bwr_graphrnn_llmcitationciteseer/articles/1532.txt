Subgraph matching is a fundamental operation in graph databases, but existing indexing techniques struggle with dynamic graphs that undergo frequent updates. This paper presents a novel indexing framework, 'DynSub', which leverages a combination of graph summarization and incremental indexing to efficiently support subgraph matching queries in dynamic graph databases. We propose a novel graph summarization algorithm that adaptively selects a subset of graph nodes to represent the entire graph, and develop an incremental indexing scheme that efficiently updates the index structure in response to graph updates. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that DynSub outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query performance and 5x in index maintenance efficiency.
