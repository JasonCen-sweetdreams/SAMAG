Neural information retrieval (NIR) models have shown promising results in ad-hoc retrieval tasks, but often struggle with document representation and query-document matching. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach, 'QDE', which leverages sentence embeddings and attention mechanisms to selectively expand documents with relevant context. We experiment with various query types and show that QDE significantly improves retrieval performance on several benchmark datasets, including Robust04 and ClueWeb09. Our analysis reveals that QDE is particularly effective in capturing nuanced semantic relationships between queries and documents.
