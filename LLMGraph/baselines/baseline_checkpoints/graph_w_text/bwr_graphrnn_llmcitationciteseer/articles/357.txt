The increasing adoption of RDF (Resource Description Framework) graphs in various applications has led to a growing need for efficient querying and indexing techniques. This paper presents a novel hybrid indexing approach that combines the benefits of bitap and trie data structures for RDF graph indexing. Our proposed method, dubbed 'HybridRDF', leverages the strengths of bitap in filtering out irrelevant patterns and the efficient prefix matching capabilities of trie structures. Experimental results on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that HybridRDF outperforms existing state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query response time and memory usage.
