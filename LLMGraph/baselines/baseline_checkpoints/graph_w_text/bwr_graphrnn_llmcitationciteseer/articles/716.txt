Multi-tenancy has become a prevalent architecture in cloud-based database systems, where multiple tenants share the same physical infrastructure. However, query optimization in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel optimization framework, 'TenantAware', which leverages statistical models to capture tenant-specific query patterns and resource utilization. We propose a hybrid approach that combines traditional cost-based optimization with machine learning-based prediction, enabling the database to adapt to changing workloads and resource constraints. Experimental evaluation on a real-world multi-tenant database system demonstrates significant performance improvements and reduced resource overhead.
