Multi-tenant database systems have become increasingly popular in cloud computing environments, where multiple organizations share a single database instance. However, this architecture poses significant challenges to query performance, particularly for complex analytical workloads. In this paper, we propose a novel column store indexing approach that leverages the characteristics of multi-tenant workloads to optimize query performance. Our approach, called CSI-MT, selectively partitions and indexes columns based on tenant-specific access patterns, resulting in improved query response times and reduced storage overhead. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database system demonstrate that CSI-MT outperforms traditional row-store indexing by up to 30% and reduces storage requirements by up to 25%.
