Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve accessibility for individuals with disabilities, but existing gesture recognition systems often struggle to accommodate diverse abilities. This paper presents a novel, adaptive gesture recognition framework that leverages machine learning and user modeling to personalize recognition accuracy for individual users. Our approach incorporates a real-time feedback mechanism, enabling users to correct and refine system performance over time. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in recognition accuracy and user satisfaction for participants with varying abilities.
