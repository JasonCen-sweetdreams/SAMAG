Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle with short and ambiguous queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural query graph embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our method, called NeuralQueryExp, represents queries as graphs and learns to embed them in a dense vector space, enabling efficient and effective query expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuralQueryExp outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
