Multi-tenancy in cloud-based database systems has led to increased resource sharing and reduced costs. However, query optimization in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel distributed query optimization framework, 'MQO', which leverages a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture to optimize query plans across multiple tenants. MQO incorporates a decentralized reinforcement learning approach to adapt to dynamic workloads and varying resource availability. Our experimental results on a real-world cloud database platform demonstrate a 30% improvement in query response time and a 25% reduction in resource utilization compared to traditional, centralized query optimization techniques.
