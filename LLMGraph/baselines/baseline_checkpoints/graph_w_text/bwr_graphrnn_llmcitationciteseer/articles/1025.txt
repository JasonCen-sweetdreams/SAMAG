Distributed databases are increasingly prevalent in modern data processing pipelines, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Traditional approaches rely on heuristics or rule-based systems, which can be suboptimal. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'DeepQO', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to adaptively select optimal query plans. We formulate query optimization as a Markov Decision Process and train a deep Q-network to learn a policy that maximizes query performance. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that DeepQO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
