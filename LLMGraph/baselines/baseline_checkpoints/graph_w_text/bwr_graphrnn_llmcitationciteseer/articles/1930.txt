Multi-tenancy is becoming increasingly prevalent in cloud-based database systems, where multiple tenants share the same physical infrastructure. However, this leads to complex query optimization challenges. This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing query execution plans for multi-tenant database systems. We propose a hierarchical planning framework that leverages tenant-level statistics and resource utilization to generate efficient query plans. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional query optimization techniques, with an average reduction of 35% in query execution time.
