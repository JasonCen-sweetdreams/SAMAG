Temporal graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex, time-varying graph data. However, optimizing queries on these databases is a challenging problem due to the inherent complexity of temporal graph structures. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach that leverages reinforcement learning to learn efficient query plans. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan. Our experimental results on a real-world temporal graph dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
