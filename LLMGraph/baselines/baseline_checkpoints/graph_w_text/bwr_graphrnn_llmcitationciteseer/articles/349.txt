This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating autonomous agents for efficient resource allocation in complex, dynamic environments. We introduce a hierarchical task network (HTN) framework that enables agents to decompose high-level tasks into smaller, more manageable subtasks, and allocate resources accordingly. Our approach leverages a combination of task planning, constraint satisfaction, and decision-theoretic reasoning to optimize resource allocation and minimize conflicts between agents. Experimental results in a simulated manufacturing scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving resource utilization and reducing task completion times.
