Coordinating task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, as agents with varying capabilities and constraints need to work together efficiently. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn effective task allocation strategies. Our GNN model, 'AgentGNN', leverages the structural properties of the agent-task graph to learn a representation of agent capabilities and task requirements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentGNN in simulated scenarios, showing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional heuristic-based approaches.
