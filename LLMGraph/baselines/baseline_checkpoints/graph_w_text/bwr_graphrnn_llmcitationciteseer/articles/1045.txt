Autonomous vehicles operating in uncertain environments face significant challenges in adapting to changing conditions. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'DRVN', which leverages uncertainty-aware exploration and robustification techniques to improve control policies. We incorporate a probabilistic model of the environment, allowing the agent to reason about uncertainty and adjust its exploration strategy accordingly. Experimental results on a simulated autonomous driving platform demonstrate that DRVN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both safety and efficiency in uncertain scenarios.
