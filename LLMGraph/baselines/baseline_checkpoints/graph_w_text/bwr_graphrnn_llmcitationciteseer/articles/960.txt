The growing complexity of hierarchical document collections necessitates efficient indexing techniques for fast query processing. This paper presents a novel query-driven indexing approach, 'HIER-index', which adaptively constructs and refines indexes based on query patterns and document structures. By leveraging the hierarchical organization of documents, HIER-index reduces the indexing overhead and accelerates query evaluation. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HIER-index outperforms existing indexing methods, achieving up to 3x faster query response times and 2x better storage efficiency.
