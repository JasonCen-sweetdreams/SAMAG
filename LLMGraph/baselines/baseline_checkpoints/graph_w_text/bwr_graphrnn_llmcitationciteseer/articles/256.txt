In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that requires efficient and trustworthy decision-making. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach that leverages blockchain technology to establish a reputation system for autonomous agents. Our framework, 'AgentRep', enables agents to evaluate each other's performance and reliability in real-time, ensuring that tasks are allocated to the most suitable agents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentRep through simulations of search-and-rescue scenarios, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
