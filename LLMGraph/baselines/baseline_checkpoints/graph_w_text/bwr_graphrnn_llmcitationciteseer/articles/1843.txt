Conventional query expansion techniques often rely on heuristic-based methods, which may not effectively capture the nuances of user intent. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for query expansion, which learn to balance the trade-off between relevance and diversity in search results. Our approach, dubbed 'DIVERSE', utilizes a hierarchical DRL model to iteratively generate expansion terms that maximize a reward function combining relevance, novelty, and coverage metrics. Experimental results on a large-scale web search dataset demonstrate that DIVERSE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of search result diversity while maintaining comparable relevance scores.
