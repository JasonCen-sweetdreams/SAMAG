Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in modern data-intensive applications. However, query optimization in such systems is a complex task due to the large search space and dynamic nature of the data distribution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan based on the system's performance metrics. We evaluate RL-Optimizer on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
