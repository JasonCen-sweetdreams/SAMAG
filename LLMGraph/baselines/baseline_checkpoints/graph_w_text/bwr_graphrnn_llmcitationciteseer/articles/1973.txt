Effective task allocation is crucial in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities must collaborate to achieve complex goals. This paper proposes Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel framework that leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to model agent relationships and task dependencies. HGAT learns to allocate tasks by inferring hierarchical graph structures that reflect agent capabilities and task requirements. Experimental results on a variety of multi-agent task allocation benchmarks demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate and agent utilization.
