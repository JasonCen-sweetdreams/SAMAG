Virtual reality (VR) has become a promising platform for various applications, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR interfaces. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, utilizing a novel avatar personalization framework that incorporates machine learning-based facial feature analysis. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, with participants exhibiting higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and self-reported motivation. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR interfaces.
