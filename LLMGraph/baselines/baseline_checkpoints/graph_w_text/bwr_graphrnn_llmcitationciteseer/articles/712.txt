The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosive growth in sensor data, posing significant challenges for real-time analytics. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, 'SIFT', which leverages a combination of in-memory caching, hierarchical clustering, and probabilistic filtering to enable fast and efficient querying of IoT sensor data streams. We demonstrate SIFT's scalability and performance through experiments on a large-scale industrial IoT dataset, achieving query response times of under 10ms for complex aggregations and joins.
