Multi-agent systems often face the challenge of efficient task allocation, which is critical in real-world applications like warehouse management and autonomous delivery. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Contrastive Learning (HCL) framework that learns to represent tasks and agents in a shared latent space, enabling effective task allocation and transfer learning across agents. Our approach leverages a hierarchical architecture to capture both local and global relationships between tasks and agents, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in simulation experiments. We demonstrate the applicability of HCL in a real-world warehouse scenario, achieving a 25% reduction in task allocation time.
