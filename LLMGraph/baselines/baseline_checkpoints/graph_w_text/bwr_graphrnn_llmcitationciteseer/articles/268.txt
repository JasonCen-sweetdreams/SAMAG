Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their lack of emotional intelligence often leads to frustration and disappointment. This study explores the design of emotionally intelligent voice assistants that can recognize and respond to users' affective states. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving user interviews, surveys, and usability testing to identify key design factors that influence user experience. Our findings suggest that incorporating emotional intelligence in voice assistants can significantly improve user satisfaction and trust. We propose a set of design guidelines and a taxonomy of emotional intelligence in voice assistants, which can inform the development of more empathetic and human-centered AI systems.
