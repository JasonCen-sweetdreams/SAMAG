Optimizing query performance is crucial for efficient data retrieval in modern databases. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing approach for multi-dimensional data, dubbed 'HiDIM'. By partitioning the data space into a hierarchical structure of smaller, correlated subspaces, HiDIM enables fast and accurate query processing. We develop an efficient indexing algorithm that minimizes storage overhead and query latency. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HiDIM outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time.
