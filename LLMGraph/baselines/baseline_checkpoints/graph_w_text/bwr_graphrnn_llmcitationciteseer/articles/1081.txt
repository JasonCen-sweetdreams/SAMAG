Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to refine user queries to better capture their information needs. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages deep contextualized embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between terms. Our approach, dubbed 'ConEx', combines BERT-based embeddings with a graph-based modeling technique to identify salient expansion terms. Experimental results on several TREC benchmarks demonstrate that ConEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, yielding significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
