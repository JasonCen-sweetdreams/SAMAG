Trust models are crucial for effective collaboration in multi-agent systems, but existing approaches often rely on a single source of evidence or assume homogeneous agent interactions. This paper presents a novel adaptive trust model, 'HeteroTrust', that integrates heterogeneous sources of evidence, including direct interactions, indirect reputation, and contextual information. We propose a probabilistic framework that learns to weigh the importance of each evidence source based on the specific scenario and agent behavior. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response domain demonstrate that HeteroTrust outperforms state-of-the-art trust models in terms of accuracy and adaptability to changing environmental conditions.
