Traditional term-based ranking models in information retrieval (IR) often struggle to capture nuanced semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'DeepRankXE', which integrates query expansion techniques with a transformer-based architecture. Our approach leverages pre-trained language models to generate expanded query representations, which are then used to compute relevance scores between queries and documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepRankXE outperforms state-of-the-art IR models, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
