Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, but existing methods often suffer from high computational costs and suboptimal ranking performance. This paper proposes a novel neural approach, Hierarchical Query Expansion Network (HQEN), which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to selectively expand queries based on document relevance. HQEN uses a lightweight neural architecture to model query-document interactions, allowing for efficient ranking and improved retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQEN outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of both ranking quality and computational efficiency.
