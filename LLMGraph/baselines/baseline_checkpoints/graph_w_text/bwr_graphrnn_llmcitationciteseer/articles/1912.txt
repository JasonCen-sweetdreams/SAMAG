This paper presents a decentralized multi-agent system (DMAS) for efficient resource allocation in smart grids. We propose a novel agent-based architecture that enables autonomous decision-making for distributed energy resources, such as solar panels and energy storage systems. Our DMAS framework utilizes a decentralized optimization algorithm to allocate resources in real-time, taking into account dynamic demand and supply profiles. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves a 23% reduction in peak demand and a 17% increase in renewable energy penetration compared to traditional centralized optimization methods.
