Cooperative multi-agent systems require efficient task allocation to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model complex agent interactions. Our approach, called GNN-TA, represents the agent network as a graph and uses GNNs to learn a distributed task allocation policy. We evaluate GNN-TA on a variety of scenarios, including search and rescue, and show that it outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization. The proposed framework is scalable, flexible, and can be applied to various real-world applications.
