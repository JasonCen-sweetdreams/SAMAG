The proliferation of IoT devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation strategies to ensure real-time processing and data transmission. This paper presents a novel autonomous agent-based framework, 'AURA', which leverages decentralized decision-making to optimize resource allocation in IoT systems. AURA agents employ a hybrid approach, combining reinforcement learning with constraint programming to adapt to dynamic system conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that AURA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of resource utilization, latency, and system resilience, while maintaining scalability and fault tolerance.
