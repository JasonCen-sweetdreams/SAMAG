State-of-the-art neural ranking models (NRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in document retrieval tasks. However, they often struggle with complex or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel query reformulation approach, 'QR-NRM', which leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) to iteratively refine and expand the original query. Our method incorporates a relevance-based reward function to guide the GAN, ensuring that the reformulated queries better capture the user's information need. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset show that QR-NRM significantly outperforms existing NRM architectures, particularly for queries with low lexical overlap with relevant documents.
