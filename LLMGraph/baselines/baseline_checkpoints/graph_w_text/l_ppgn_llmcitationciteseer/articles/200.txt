Multi-agent systems often require conflict resolution mechanisms to ensure efficient and fair resource allocation. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous conflict resolution using graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Our proposed framework, 'AgentGCN', leverages the structural properties of agent interactions to learn conflict resolution strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentGCN in various scenarios, including resource allocation and task assignment, outperforming traditional rule-based and reinforcement learning-based approaches. The results show that AgentGCN can adapt to dynamic environments and generalize to unseen conflict scenarios, making it a promising solution for real-world multi-agent applications.
