Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large volumes of data and provide high availability. However, query optimization in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization that exploits the inherent parallelism in distributed databases. We introduce a dynamic query rewriting technique that leverages statistical models to predict query execution times and adapt to changing workloads. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant improvements in query execution times and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
