This study investigates the impact of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) on elderly users' trust and cognitive performance. We designed and evaluated two ECAs, differing in their level of anthropomorphism and expressiveness, in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment with 30 elderly participants. Results show that the more anthropomorphic ECA increased users' trust and improved their cognitive recall, but also led to higher expectations and disappointment. We discuss the implications for ECA design and provide guidelines for creating more effective and trustworthy interfaces for elderly users.
