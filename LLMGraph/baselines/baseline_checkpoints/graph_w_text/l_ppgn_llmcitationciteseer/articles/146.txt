Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between entities. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge due to the inherent complexity of graph data structures. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraFOpt', which leverages a combination of graph summarization, index-based query rewriting, and adaptive caching to improve query performance. We evaluate GraFOpt on several real-world graph datasets and demonstrate significant speedups compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques, making graph databases more scalable and efficient for large-scale applications.
