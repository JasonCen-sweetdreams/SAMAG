Specialized search engines, such as those for academic publications or e-commerce products, often struggle with complex queries that require nuanced understanding of domain-specific terminology. This paper presents a novel approach to query reformulation, leveraging deep hierarchical neural networks to recursively refine queries and improve retrieval accuracy. Our approach, dubbed 'HierQR', incorporates domain-specific knowledge graphs and word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms. Experimental results on a large-scale academic search dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency compared to existing query reformulation techniques.
