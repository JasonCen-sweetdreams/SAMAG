Uncertainty quantification is crucial in computer vision applications, such as object detection and segmentation, where model uncertainty can impact decision-making. This paper presents a novel Bayesian neural network framework, 'BayesVision', that efficiently quantifies uncertainty through stochastic weight perturbations and probabilistic output layers. We propose a sparse Gaussian process prior to reduce the number of parameters and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on popular benchmarks, including CIFAR-10 and Cityscapes, demonstrate that BayesVision achieves state-of-the-art performance in uncertainty estimation while maintaining competitive accuracy with deterministic models.
