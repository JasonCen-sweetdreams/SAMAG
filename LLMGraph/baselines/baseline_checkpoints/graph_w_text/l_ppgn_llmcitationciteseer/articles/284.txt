Distributed information retrieval systems (DIRS) are increasingly important for handling large-scale search queries. However, existing indexing techniques often lead to inefficient query processing and high communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel query-specific indexing approach, 'QSIndex', which dynamically adapts to the query patterns and document distributions in DIRS. QSIndex leverages a hybrid indexing structure that combines the benefits of inverted indexing and document-based indexing. Our experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that QSIndex achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency, reducing average query response time by up to 37% compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
