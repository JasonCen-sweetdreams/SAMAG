Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in complex environments is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinate autonomous agents using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). We design a hierarchical framework that consists of a high-level coordination layer and a low-level control layer. The coordination layer uses a centralized critic to learn a value function that guides the agents' decisions, while the control layer employs decentralized actor-critic methods to execute actions. We evaluate our approach in a simulated multi-robot system and demonstrate improved coordination and task completion rates compared to decentralized reinforcement learning methods.
