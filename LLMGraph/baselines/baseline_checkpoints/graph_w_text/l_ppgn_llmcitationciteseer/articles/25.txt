In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach, GCN-TA, that leverages graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn task allocation policies. Our method exploits the graph structure of agent interactions and uses GCNs to encode agent features and task dependencies. We show that GCN-TA outperforms traditional centralized and distributed methods in various simulated scenarios, including robotic search and rescue, and smart traffic management. The proposed approach enables real-time task allocation in large-scale multi-agent systems with limited communication overhead.
