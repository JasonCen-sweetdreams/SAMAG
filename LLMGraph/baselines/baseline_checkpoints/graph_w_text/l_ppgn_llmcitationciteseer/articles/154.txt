This paper presents a novel framework for autonomous agents to negotiate in competitive environments. We introduce a context-aware negotiation strategy that incorporates opponent modeling, concession analysis, and adaptive decision-making. Our approach enables agents to dynamically adjust their negotiation tactics based on the opponent's behavior, leading to improved outcomes in terms of utility and efficiency. Experimental results using a real-world negotiation dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in outperforming traditional negotiation strategies.
