Passage retrieval is a crucial component of many information retrieval systems, but it can be computationally expensive, especially for large document collections. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical document representation scheme that enables efficient passage retrieval. Our approach represents each document as a hierarchical graph, where nodes correspond to passages, and edges capture semantic relationships between them. We propose a graph-based ranking model that leverages this representation to retrieve relevant passages. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval methods in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
