Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but its accessibility for users with disabilities remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key accessibility barriers and developed a set of guidelines for VR developers to create accessible and usable VR interfaces. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our framework improves the overall VR experience for users with disabilities, enhancing their sense of presence, engagement, and satisfaction.
