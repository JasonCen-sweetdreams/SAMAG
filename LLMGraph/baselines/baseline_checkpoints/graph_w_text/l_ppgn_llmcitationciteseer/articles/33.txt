Explainable recommendation systems have garnered significant attention in recent years, as they provide insights into the decision-making process. This paper introduces HAGN, a hierarchical attentional graph neural network that leverages item-level and user-level interactions to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. HAGN learns to identify influential nodes in the user-item graph and attends to relevant contextual information, resulting in more accurate and interpretable recommendations. We evaluate HAGN on three real-world datasets, demonstrating improved recommendation performance and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.
