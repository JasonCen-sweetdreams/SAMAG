Optimizing query execution plans in distributed database systems is a complex problem due to the large solution space and dynamic nature of the system. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network (DQN) that learns to select the optimal execution plan for a given query by interacting with the database system. The DQN is trained using a reward function that balances query execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
