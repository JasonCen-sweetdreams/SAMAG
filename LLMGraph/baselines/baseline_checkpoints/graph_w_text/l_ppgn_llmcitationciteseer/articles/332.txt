Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but it remains challenging due to the complexity and scale of real-world graphs. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant nodes and subgraphs. HGAT hierarchically aggregates node features and attention weights, enabling efficient classification of nodes in large graphs. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
