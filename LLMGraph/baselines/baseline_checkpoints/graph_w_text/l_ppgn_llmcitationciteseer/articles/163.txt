Neural search engines have revolutionized information retrieval by incorporating neural networks into the ranking process. However, their performance is heavily reliant on explicit user feedback, which is often scarce. This paper proposes an adaptive re-ranking framework that leverages implicit feedback, such as dwell time and scrolling behavior, to improve search result ranking. We introduce a novel neural architecture that combines explicit and implicit signals, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a large-scale search engine dataset. Experimental results show significant improvements in ranking quality and user engagement metrics.
