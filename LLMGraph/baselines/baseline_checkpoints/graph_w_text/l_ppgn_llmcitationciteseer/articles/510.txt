This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for heterogeneous multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'HeteroRL', which enables agents to learn optimal task assignments based on their individual capabilities and preferences. HeteroRL leverages a combination of Deep Q-Networks and Graph Convolutional Networks to capture complex agent-agent and agent-task interactions. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate that HeteroRL outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion efficiency and robustness to agent failures.
