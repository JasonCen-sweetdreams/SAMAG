Few-shot learning (FSL) has made significant progress in recent years, but most existing methods rely on a fixed metric space or are limited to a single level of abstraction. We propose a hierarchical FSL approach that meta-learns prototypes across multiple levels of abstraction, enabling more flexible and accurate image classification. Our method, Hierarchical Meta-Prototypes (HMP), leverages a nested episodic training framework to adapt to new tasks and classes. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that HMP outperforms state-of-the-art FSL methods, especially in the low-data regime.
