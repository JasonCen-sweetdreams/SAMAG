This paper investigates the design of voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study to evaluate the speech recognition accuracy and user experience of popular voice assistants among older adults with varying levels of hearing impairment. Our results show that existing voice assistants struggle to recognize speech from older adults, particularly those with hearing impairments. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants, including personalized speech recognition models, simplified dialogue flows, and multimodal feedback mechanisms. Our prototype, 'ElderVoice', demonstrates improved speech recognition accuracy and user satisfaction among older adults.
