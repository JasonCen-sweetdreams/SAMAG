Time series classification is a critical task in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and IoT. However, real-world datasets often exhibit class imbalance, leading to poor performance of traditional machine learning models. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical transfer learning approach, 'HiTS', which leverages pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as feature extractors and adaptively adjusts the feature importance based on class frequencies. We evaluate HiTS on four benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in F1-score and AUC-ROC compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
