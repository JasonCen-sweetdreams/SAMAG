Modern recommendation systems rely on graph-based models to capture complex user-item relationships. However, the scalability of these models is often limited by the quadratic complexity of graph neural networks. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages graph clustering and attention mechanisms to scale to massive user-item graphs. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while reducing computational complexity by an order of magnitude. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the convergence of HGAT and demonstrate its applicability in real-world e-commerce scenarios.
