Distributed databases have become a cornerstone of modern data analytics, but optimizing query performance in real-time remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'Aurora', an adaptive query optimization framework that leverages machine learning to dynamically adjust query execution plans based on workload patterns and system resources. We propose a novel cost model that incorporates statistical profiling, query execution history, and resource utilization metrics to guide plan optimization. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database benchmark demonstrate that Aurora achieves up to 3x performance improvements over state-of-the-art query optimizers.
