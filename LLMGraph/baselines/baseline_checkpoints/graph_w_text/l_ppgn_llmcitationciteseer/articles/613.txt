Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture the semantic intent behind user queries, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework that leverages neural entity embeddings to improve the retrieval performance. Our approach first identifies key entities in the query and then expands them using a hierarchical graph-based model, incorporating semantic relationships between entities. Experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
