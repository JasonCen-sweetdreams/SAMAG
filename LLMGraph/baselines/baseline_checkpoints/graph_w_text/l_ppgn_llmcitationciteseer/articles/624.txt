Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem in AI research, requiring efficient decision-making and communication among agents. This paper presents a novel approach that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with graph neural networks (GNNs) to coordinate agent behavior. We propose a decentralized RL framework, where each agent learns to optimize its policy based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. The GNN is used to process the graph-structured data and learn effective message passing between agents. Experimental results on a traffic management scenario demonstrate improved coordination and reduced congestion compared to traditional RL methods.
