Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on heuristics or manual feature engineering. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning framework, 'RL-QE', which learns to expand queries by interacting with a simulated retrieval environment. We formulate query expansion as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network to select expansion terms that maximize the expected retrieval performance. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly in cases where the initial query is noisy or incomplete.
