With the increasing adoption of renewable energy sources, smart grids require efficient and adaptive resource allocation to ensure reliable and efficient power distribution. This paper proposes a decentralized autonomous agent framework, 'DARA', that leverages multi-agent systems to optimize real-time resource allocation in smart grids. DARA employs a hybrid approach, combining model-based reasoning with machine learning, to enable agents to learn from experience and adapt to changing grid conditions. Experimental results using real-world data demonstrate that DARA achieves significant improvements in resource utilization and grid stability compared to traditional centralized approaches.
