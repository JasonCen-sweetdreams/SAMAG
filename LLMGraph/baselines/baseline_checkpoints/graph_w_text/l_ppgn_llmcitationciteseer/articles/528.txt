Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in providing emotional support to individuals, but effective communication with users remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces 'Echo', a novel embodied conversational agent designed to provide empathetic support in VR. Echo uses a combination of machine learning-based affect recognition and natural language processing to simulate human-like conversations. We conducted a user study to evaluate the efficacy of Echo in reducing stress and anxiety levels in participants. Results show that users who interacted with Echo reported significant reductions in self-reported stress levels compared to a control group.
