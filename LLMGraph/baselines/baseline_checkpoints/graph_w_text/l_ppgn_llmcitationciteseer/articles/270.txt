The proliferation of online information has led to a pressing need for more efficient and diverse document retrieval systems. This paper proposes a novel hybrid ranking model, 'DREM', which combines the strengths of traditional term-based retrieval and neural-based ranking techniques. DREM leverages a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize ranking, relevance, and diversity metrics, resulting in significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that DREM achieves higher precision, recall, and novelty scores while reducing computational overhead by up to 30%.
