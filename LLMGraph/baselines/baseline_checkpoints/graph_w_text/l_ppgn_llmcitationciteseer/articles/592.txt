Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize learning experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study investigates the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user engagement in VR-based learning environments. We designed an experimental study with 120 participants, who completed a series of learning tasks in a VR environment with and without haptic feedback. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly increases user engagement, measured through self-reported satisfaction, time spent on tasks, and physiological responses. We also identify key factors influencing the effectiveness of haptic feedback, including task complexity and individual differences in haptic perception. The findings have implications for the design of immersive learning systems that incorporate haptic feedback to promote user engagement and learning outcomes.
