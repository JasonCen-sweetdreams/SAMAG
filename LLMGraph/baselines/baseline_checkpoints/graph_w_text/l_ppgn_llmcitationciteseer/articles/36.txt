Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying complex relationships between data entities. However, as graph sizes continue to grow, query optimization becomes a significant bottleneck. This paper presents 'GraphOpt', a novel query optimization framework designed specifically for distributed graph databases. GraphOpt leverages graph structural properties to prune the search space and exploits parallelism to speed up query execution. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world social network dataset demonstrates that GraphOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 5x in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
