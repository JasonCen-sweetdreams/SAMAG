The increasing reliance on time series data in various applications has raised concerns about the vulnerability of these systems to adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect such attacks using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on time series data. Our method, dubbed 'TS-Guard', models the temporal dependencies and relationships between time series variables as a graph, enabling the detection of subtle anomalies indicative of adversarial attacks. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-Guard in detecting attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 15% in terms of F1-score.
