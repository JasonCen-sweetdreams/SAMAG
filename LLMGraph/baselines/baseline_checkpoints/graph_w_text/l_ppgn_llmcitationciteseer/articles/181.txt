Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in knowledge graph construction, where the goal is to resolve ambiguities in entity references. Existing approaches often struggle with scalability and incremental updates, leading to poor performance on large, dynamic knowledge graphs. This paper proposes a novel graph-based embedding method, 'GraphED', which leverages incremental clustering to efficiently disambiguate entities. By representing entities as graph embeddings and clustering them based on similarity, GraphED achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets while supporting incremental updates and handling large-scale knowledge graphs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GraphED in resolving entity ambiguities.
