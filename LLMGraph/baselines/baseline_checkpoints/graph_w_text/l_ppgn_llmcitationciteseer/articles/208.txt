Time-series anomaly detection is crucial in various domains, but existing methods often lack interpretability and scalability. We propose a hierarchical multi-task learning framework, 'HMTL-AD', which jointly learns anomaly detection and feature importance attribution. By stacking task-specific autoencoders, HMTL-AD captures complex temporal patterns and contextual relationships. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmark datasets and provides explicit feature importance scores, enabling explainable anomaly detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of HMTL-AD in real-world applications.
