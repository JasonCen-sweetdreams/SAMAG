Document retrieval in specialized domains often requires nuanced understanding of domain-specific terminology and semantics. This paper proposes a neural query expansion approach, 'DomainQE', which leverages domain-specific knowledge graphs to generate context-aware query expansions. Our approach incorporates a novel graph attention mechanism to selectively weigh and combine knowledge graph embeddings, resulting in more accurate and relevant document retrievals. Experiments on a large biomedical dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall compared to traditional query expansion methods.
