We present a novel framework for coordinating task-oriented agents in decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes (Dec-POMDPs). Our approach, called COORD, leverages a hierarchical decomposition of the Dec-POMDP into smaller sub-problems, which are solved using a decentralized optimization algorithm. We show that COORD outperforms existing methods in several benchmarks, achieving improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of COORD in certain classes of Dec-POMDPs.
