Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but its adoption is hindered by accessibility barriers for users with disabilities. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for designing inclusive VR interfaces, focusing on users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. We develop a set of guidelines and recommendations based on a mixed-methods approach, combining user studies, expert interviews, and usability testing. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in user experience and task performance for users with disabilities, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in VR development.
