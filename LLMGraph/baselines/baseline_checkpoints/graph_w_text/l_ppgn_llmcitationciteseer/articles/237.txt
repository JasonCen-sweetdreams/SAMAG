The proliferation of IoT devices has led to a growing need for efficient task allocation mechanisms. This paper presents 'MARL-TA', a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that enables dynamic task allocation in large-scale IoT networks. Our approach leverages a decentralized, asynchronous learning paradigm that allows agents to adapt to changing network conditions and task requirements. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that MARL-TA achieves significant improvements in task completion rates and reduced latency compared to traditional, centralized allocation methods.
