Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, particularly when queries are short or ambiguous. We propose a novel approach, Neural Query Graphs (NQG), which leverages graph neural networks to learn query representations that incorporate semantic relationships between terms. NQG expands the original query by generating a set of relevant sub-queries, which are then used to re-rank documents. Our experiments on the TREC Robust04 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, with NQG outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion methods by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
