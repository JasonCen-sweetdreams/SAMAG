Neural search has emerged as a powerful paradigm for information retrieval, but its effectiveness is often hindered by the limitations of query representation. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages variational autoencoders (VAEs) to capture the underlying semantic structure of queries. Our approach, termed 'NeuroExpand', uses a VAE-based query encoder to generate a dense, disentangled representation of the query, which is then used to retrieve relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExpand outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness while reducing computational overhead.
