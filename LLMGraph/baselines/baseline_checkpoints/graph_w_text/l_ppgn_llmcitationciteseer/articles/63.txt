Distributed resource allocation is a crucial problem in many real-world applications, such as smart grids, traffic management, and cloud computing. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARLA', that addresses the scalability challenges in large-scale distributed systems. MARLA employs a decentralized actor-critic architecture, where each agent learns to optimize its local policy while communicating with its neighbors to achieve global coordination. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MARLA in a simulated smart grid environment, showing improved convergence rates and resource allocation efficiency compared to existing methods.
