Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on handcrafted rules or simple statistical models. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DLQE', which leverages pre-trained language models to generate contextualized query expansions. Our method incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to weigh the importance of expansion terms and a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DLQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
