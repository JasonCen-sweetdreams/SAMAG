Distributed databases have become a cornerstone of modern data management, but optimizing queries across multiple nodes remains a complex challenge. This paper presents 'RL-Optimizer', a novel query optimization framework that leverages reinforcement learning to adapt to dynamic workloads and node configurations. By modeling query optimization as a Markov decision process, RL-Optimizer learns to select optimal join orders, indexing strategies, and data placement schemes that minimize latency and maximize throughput. Experimental evaluations on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
