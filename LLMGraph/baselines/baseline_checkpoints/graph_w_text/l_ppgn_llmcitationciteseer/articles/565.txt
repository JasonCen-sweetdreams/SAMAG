Traditional document retrieval methods rely on hand-crafted features and ranking models, which often fail to capture the semantic nuances of natural language queries. This paper proposes a novel attention-based neural ranking model, 'AttRank', which leverages deep learning to learn query-document relevance patterns. AttRank utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant query terms and document passages, enabling more accurate retrieval results. Experimental evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of AttRank over state-of-the-art ranking models, particularly in handling complex, multi-entity queries.
