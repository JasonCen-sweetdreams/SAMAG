Voice assistants have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments, but current systems often fall short in terms of usability and accessibility. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to developing voice assistants that accommodate the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the design of a novel voice assistant system, 'ElderVoice', which incorporates features such as simplified language processing, personalized feedback, and multimodal input. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
