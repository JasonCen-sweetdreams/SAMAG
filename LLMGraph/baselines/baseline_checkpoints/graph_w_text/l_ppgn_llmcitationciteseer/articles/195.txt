Real-time traffic signal control is a challenging problem that requires coordinating multiple agents to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. This paper presents a scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, dubbed 'SmartSignal', which leverages decentralized deep Q-networks to optimize signal timing at individual intersections. We propose a novel communication protocol that enables agents to share local state information and coordinate actions in real-time, while ensuring scalability to large networks. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulation platform demonstrate that SmartSignal outperforms traditional fixed-time and traffic-responsive signal control strategies, reducing average travel times by up to 23%.
