 Gesture recognition systems have the potential to enhance the quality of life for people with motor impairments. However, existing systems often fail to account for the variability and inconsistency in gestures exhibited by individuals with motor impairments. This paper presents a novel adaptive gesture recognition system that leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to recognize and adapt to the unique gesture patterns of individuals with motor impairments. Our system incorporates a personalized gesture modeling approach that updates the recognition model based on user feedback, enabling accurate recognition of gestures despite variations in speed, orientation, and movement quality. We evaluate our system with a group of participants with motor impairments and demonstrate significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction.
