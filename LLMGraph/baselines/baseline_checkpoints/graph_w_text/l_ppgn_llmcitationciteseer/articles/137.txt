This paper presents a novel approach to cooperative task allocation for multi-agent systems using graph neural networks (GNNs). We model the agent-task interaction as a graph, where agents and tasks are represented as nodes, and edges denote the feasibility of task assignment. Our GNN-based algorithm learns to predict the optimal task allocation by leveraging the structural properties of the graph. We evaluate our approach on a set of benchmark scenarios and demonstrate significant improvements in terms of task completion time and agent utilization compared to traditional methods. Our results have implications for the coordination of autonomous robots, drones, and other multi-agent systems.
