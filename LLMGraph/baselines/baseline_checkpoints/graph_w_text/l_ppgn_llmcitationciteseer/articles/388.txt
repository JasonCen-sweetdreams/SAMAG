This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. We propose an autonomous framework, 'AgentTA', which enables agents to learn optimal task assignments in dynamic environments. AgentTA leverages a graph neural network to model agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn task allocation policies. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that AgentTA outperforms traditional auction-based methods in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization. Our approach has potential applications in real-world domains such as search and rescue, smart manufacturing, and autonomous vehicles.
