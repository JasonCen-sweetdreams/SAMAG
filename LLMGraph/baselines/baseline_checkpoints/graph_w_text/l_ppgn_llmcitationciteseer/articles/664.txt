Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessible interfaces for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel VR interface designed to facilitate navigation and interaction for visually impaired users. We employ a multimodal approach, combining audio, tactile, and gestural feedback to provide an immersive experience. Our user study involving 20 visually impaired participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to existing VR systems. We also discuss design implications and future directions for inclusive VR design.
