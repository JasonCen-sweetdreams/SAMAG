Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but users with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents an AR design framework, 'AccessibleAR', that incorporates audio and haptic feedback to enable users with visual impairments to interact with virtual objects in a seamless and intuitive manner. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that AccessibleAR significantly improved task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional screen reader-based approaches. Our framework provides a foundation for designing inclusive AR experiences that can benefit a broader range of users.
