Coordinating task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to enable cooperative task allocation. We introduce a decentralized, model-free algorithm that utilizes a graph neural network to represent agent interactions and a deep Q-network to learn optimal task assignments. Experimental results in a simulated package delivery scenario demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and reduction in overall system latency compared to traditional, rule-based allocation methods.
