As virtual reality (VR) becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding human-robot collaboration in these environments is crucial. This paper investigates the role of embodiment in VR-based human-robot collaboration, where users are represented by avatars and interact with robots through gestures. We conduct a user study comparing two conditions: embodied and non-embodied collaboration. Our results show that embodied collaboration leads to improved task performance, enhanced user satisfaction, and increased trust in the robot. We also identify key factors influencing these outcomes, including avatar design and gesture recognition accuracy. Our findings have significant implications for the design of future VR-based human-robot collaboration systems.
