Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. One major challenge is the vocabulary mismatch between the query and documents. In this paper, we propose a novel neural query expansion approach that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to improve retrieval performance. Our model, called NQE-PRF, learns to generate query expansions by predicting relevant documents based on the initial retrieval results. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQE-PRF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially for queries with limited relevant documents.
