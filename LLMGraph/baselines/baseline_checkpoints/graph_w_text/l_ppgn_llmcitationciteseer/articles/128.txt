This study explores the role of emotional feedback loops in human-computer interaction, focusing on the use of affective avatar-based interfaces. We developed an empirical framework to analyze users' emotional responses to avatar-mediated feedback and investigated how these responses influence their interaction experience. Our results show that embodied avatars can create a sense of emotional resonance, leading to increased user engagement and affective synchronization. However, we also found that mismatched emotional feedback can result in user frustration and disengagement. Our findings have implications for the design of emotionally intelligent interfaces that can effectively recognize and respond to users' emotional states.
