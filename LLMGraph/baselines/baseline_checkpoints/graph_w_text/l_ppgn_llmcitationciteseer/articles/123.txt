Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but current interaction designs often neglect the role of embodied cognition. This paper investigates the effects of gesture-based interaction on user experience and performance in VR. We designed and evaluated a novel gesture-based system that leverages cognitive metaphors to enhance spatial reasoning and presence. Our user study reveals significant improvements in task completion time and self-reported sense of presence compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. The findings have implications for the development of more intuitive and immersive VR experiences.
