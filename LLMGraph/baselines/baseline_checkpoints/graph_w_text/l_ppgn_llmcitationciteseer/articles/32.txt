Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in Information Retrieval (IR) due to the inherent complexity of natural language queries. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and deep neural networks. Our proposed model, 'HierExpan', learns to generate effective query expansions by exploring a hierarchical action space, where the agent selects relevant terms and phrases to add to the original query. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, outperforming state-of-the-art expansion methods.
