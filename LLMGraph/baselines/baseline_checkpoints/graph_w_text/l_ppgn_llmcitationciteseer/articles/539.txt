Ad-hoc search queries often exhibit nuanced context and intent, which traditional retrieval models struggle to capture. We propose a novel deep relevance ranking approach, 'CARPE', that leverages context-aware query embeddings to better model query semantics. CARPE incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on salient query terms and their contextual relationships. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc search benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in ranking quality and retrieval effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models.
