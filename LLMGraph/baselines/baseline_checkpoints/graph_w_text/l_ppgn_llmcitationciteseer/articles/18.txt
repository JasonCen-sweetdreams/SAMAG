Entity retrieval is a crucial task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve entities that match a given query. One of the key challenges in entity retrieval is the vocabulary mismatch problem, where the query terms do not match the terms used in the entity descriptions. In this paper, we propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages graph-based semantic embeddings to expand the query terms. Our approach uses a graph neural network to learn entity representations that capture the semantic relationships between entities and terms. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance compared to state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
