Query representation plays a crucial role in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it directly impacts the retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query representation framework, HQRF, which captures both local and global semantic patterns in queries. HQRF employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to learn query representations at multiple granularities, enabling more accurate document ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HQRF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query representation methods, achieving up to 15% improvement in mean average precision.
