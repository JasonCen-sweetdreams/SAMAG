Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms have gained popularity for their scalability and ease of use. However, query optimization in multi-tenant DBaaS environments remains a challenge due to the complexity of resource sharing and dynamic workload patterns. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'OptiShare', which leverages machine learning-based workload prediction and dynamic resource allocation to minimize query latency and improve overall system throughput. Our experiments on a real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate that OptiShare reduces average query latency by up to 30% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
