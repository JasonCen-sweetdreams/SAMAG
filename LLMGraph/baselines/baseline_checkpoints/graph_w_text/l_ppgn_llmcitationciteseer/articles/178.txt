Short text retrieval is a challenging task due to the limited context and sparse term frequencies. Query expansion techniques can improve retrieval performance, but traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well. We propose a deep neural network-based approach, 'DQE-Net', which learns to expand queries by modeling semantic relationships between terms. Our experiments on several short text datasets demonstrate that DQE-Net outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
