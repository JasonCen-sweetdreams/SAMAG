Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but its adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that cater to the needs of visually impaired users. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with visually impaired individuals to identify key challenges and opportunities in VR interaction. Our framework incorporates audio-based navigation, tactile feedback, and personalized accessibility features. We evaluated our approach through a user study, demonstrating significant improvements in user engagement and task completion rates compared to traditional VR interfaces.
