In dynamic multi-agent systems, effective task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework, 'MA-RL', that enables agents to adaptively allocate tasks based on changing environmental conditions and agent capabilities. MA-RL utilizes a decentralized, asynchronous Q-learning approach to learn optimal task assignments and coordination strategies. We evaluate MA-RL in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional, centralized allocation methods.
