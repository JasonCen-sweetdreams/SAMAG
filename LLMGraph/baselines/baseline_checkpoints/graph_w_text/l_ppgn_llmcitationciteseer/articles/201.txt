Emotion recognition in conversational agents is a crucial aspect of human-computer interaction. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that integrates multimodal features from speech, text, and facial expressions to recognize emotions in real-time conversations. Our HAN model consists of three levels of attention: modality-level, utterance-level, and conversation-level, which enables the model to capture complex contextual relationships between modalities. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions, especially in cases of ambiguity or context-dependent emotions.
