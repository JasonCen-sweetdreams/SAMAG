In dynamic environments, efficient task allocation is crucial for autonomous agents to achieve their goals. This paper presents a novel framework, 'DynAlloc', which enables agents to adaptively coordinate task assignment based on real-time environment changes. DynAlloc integrates a decentralized decision-making mechanism with a probabilistic model of task dependencies, allowing agents to dynamically adjust their task allocations to minimize expected latency and maximize overall utility. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that DynAlloc outperforms existing static allocation methods by up to 30% in terms of task completion rate and reduces average response time by 25%.
