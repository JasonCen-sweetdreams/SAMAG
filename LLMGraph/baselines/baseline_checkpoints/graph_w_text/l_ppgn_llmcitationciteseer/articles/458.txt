Traditional document ranking models rely on static query-document matching, neglecting the context in which the query is issued. This paper proposes a novel context-aware document ranking approach, 'CADR', which leverages hierarchical attention networks to capture complex relationships between query context, document content, and user preferences. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TREC Deep Learning Track, demonstrating significant improvements in ranking accuracy and diversity. We also provide an in-depth analysis of the learned attention patterns, shedding light on the importance of contextual factors in search tasks.
