Real-time data warehousing has become a critical component of modern business intelligence. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'ElasticQ', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and statistical models to predict query execution times and dynamically adjust query plans. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group similar queries and a cost-based optimizer to select the most efficient execution strategy. Experimental results on a popular open-source data warehousing platform demonstrate that ElasticQ achieves up to 3x query performance improvement and reduces query latency by 40% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
