Virtual agents are increasingly used in various applications, including customer service, education, and healthcare. While trust is a crucial aspect of human-agent interaction, the role of embodiment in trust formation remains understudied. This paper investigates the impact of different levels of embodiment on trust in virtual agents. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, exposing them to three conditions: text-based, 2D avatar, and 3D humanoid avatar. Our results show that participants who interacted with the 3D humanoid avatar reported higher levels of trust and perceived the agent as more trustworthy and competent. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of trustworthy virtual agents.
