Distributed database systems are increasingly prevalent in modern data-intensive applications, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a Markov decision process that models the query optimization problem and employ a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy. Our experiments on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate a significant reduction in query latency and improvement in resource utilization compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
