The proliferation of IoT devices and social media platforms has led to an exponential growth in multi-dimensional data. Traditional indexing techniques are often inefficient in distributed database systems, resulting in poor query performance. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'DIMEX', which leverages a combination of dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques to accelerate query processing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DIMEX through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, achieving significant improvements in query response times and reduced storage overhead.
