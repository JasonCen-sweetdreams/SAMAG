E-commerce search engines struggle to balance relevance and diversity in their retrieval results. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'DiversiRank', which incorporates a diversified attention mechanism to promote novelty and variety in the top-ranked items. We train DiversiRank on a large-scale e-commerce dataset using a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes for relevance, diversity, and user satisfaction. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in both retrieval effectiveness and user experience metrics compared to state-of-the-art baseline models.
