Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become a crucial source of data for disease diagnosis. However, existing machine learning models often lack interpretability, making it challenging to understand their decision-making processes. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that incorporates attention mechanisms at multiple levels to highlight relevant clinical features and EHR segments contributing to the predicted diagnosis. We evaluate our approach on a large EHR dataset, demonstrating improved diagnosis accuracy and providing insights into the model's decision-making process through visualized attention weights.
