Query expansion and neural ranking have been shown to improve document retrieval performance, but existing approaches often rely on simple keyword-based expansion or vanilla neural architectures. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'HierarchicalQE', which integrates hierarchical query expansion with a neural ranking model. Our approach leverages entity disambiguation and semantic role labeling to generate a hierarchical representation of the query, which is then used to expand the query terms. The expanded query is fed into a neural ranking model that incorporates contextualized embeddings and attention mechanisms. Experiments on the TREC-8 and rob04 datasets demonstrate that HierarchicalQE outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
