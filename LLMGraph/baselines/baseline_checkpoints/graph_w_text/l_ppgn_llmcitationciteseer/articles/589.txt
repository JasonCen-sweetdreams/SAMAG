This paper presents a novel approach to incentivizing cooperation in multi-agent systems by adaptively shaping rewards based on the agents' behavioral patterns. Our method, called Adaptive Reward Shaping (ARS), uses a decentralized, online learning framework to identify and reinforce cooperative behaviors. We evaluate ARS in a series of experiments involving both homogeneous and heterogeneous agent populations, demonstrating significant improvements in cooperative outcomes compared to traditional reward functions. Theoretical analysis and simulations further support the effectiveness of ARS in promoting cooperation in complex, dynamic environments.
