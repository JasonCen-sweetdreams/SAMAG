Virtual reality (VR) systems often struggle to provide users with intuitive and emotionally engaging experiences. This paper presents an innovative framework for designing emotional feedback loops in VR, which adapt to users' physiological and behavioral responses in real-time. Our approach integrates machine learning-based affect recognition with cognitive models of emotional regulation, enabling VR systems to modulate user emotions through dynamic interface adaptations. We report results from a user study demonstrating improved emotional resonance and user satisfaction in VR experiences designed with our framework.
