Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has emerged as a promising approach for open-domain question answering. However, the complexity of neural query graph construction hinders its efficiency. This paper proposes a novel neural query graph generation framework, 'NQG-Gen', which learns to generate query graphs from input questions. NQG-Gen leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively attend to relevant passages and iteratively refine the query graph. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that NQG-Gen achieves comparable retrieval performance to state-of-the-art DPR methods while reducing inference time by up to 30%.
