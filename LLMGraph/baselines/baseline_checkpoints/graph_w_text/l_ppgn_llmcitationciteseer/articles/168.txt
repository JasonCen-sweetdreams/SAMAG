Ad-hoc retrieval systems often rely on query expansion techniques to improve retrieval performance. However, existing methods suffer from issues such as query drift and term mismatch. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DocEmbQE', which leverages document embeddings to generate query expansions. Our method learns a dense representation of documents and uses this to identify relevant terms for expansion. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DocEmbQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
