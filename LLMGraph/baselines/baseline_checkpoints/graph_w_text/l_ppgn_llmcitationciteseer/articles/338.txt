This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for cooperative resource allocation in smart grids. We model the grid as a decentralized system consisting of autonomous agents, each responsible for managing a subset of resources. The agents learn to cooperate through a novel, graph-based communication mechanism that enables the exchange of local information. Our approach is evaluated on a realistic simulation platform, demonstrating improved efficiency and resilience in the face of uncertain demand and supply patterns. We show that the proposed method outperforms traditional, centralized optimization techniques in terms of both resource utilization and response time.
