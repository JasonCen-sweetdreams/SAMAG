Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, but optimizing query performance remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach to query optimization, which leverages graph theory to model query plans and identify efficient execution paths. Our method, called GraphOpt, uses a combination of graph clustering and shortest path algorithms to reduce the search space of possible query plans. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system show that GraphOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
