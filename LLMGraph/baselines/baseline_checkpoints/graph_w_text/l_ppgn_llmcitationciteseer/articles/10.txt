Coordinating the actions of multiple agents to achieve a common goal is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent interactions and dependencies. By representing the agent network as a graph, our method can capture complex relationships between agents and tasks, and learn to allocate tasks that maximize system efficiency. Experimental results on a simulated robotic swarm demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate and system adaptability.
