Traditional information retrieval (IR) methods often rely on hand-crafted features and simplistic ranking models. This paper proposes a novel graph-based neural network (GNN) approach for document ranking, which leverages the structural relationships between query terms and document entities. Our model, GraphRank, learns to represent documents as graphs and utilizes a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global context. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphRank outperforms state-of-the-art IR methods in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
