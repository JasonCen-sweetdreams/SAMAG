Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has become a popular paradigm for open-domain question answering, but its effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality of the query representation. This paper proposes a hierarchical query expansion (HQE) framework that leverages both semantic and syntactic relationships between query terms to generate a more comprehensive and informative query representation. Our approach is designed to work in tandem with DPR models, and we demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency on several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of HQE on the robustness of DPR models to query variations and document length.
