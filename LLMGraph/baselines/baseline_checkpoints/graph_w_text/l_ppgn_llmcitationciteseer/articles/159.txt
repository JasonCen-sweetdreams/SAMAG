Optimizing query execution in distributed relational databases is a challenging problem due to the complex interactions between query plans, data distributions, and system configurations. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively optimize query execution plans in response to changing workload and system conditions. Our framework, 'RL-Optimizer', uses a deep Q-network to learn an optimal policy for query optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art heuristics and rule-based approaches in extensive experiments on a real-world dataset.
