Decentralized multi-agent planning problems with incomplete information are challenging due to the exponential growth of the joint action space. This paper proposes a novel approach that integrates deep reinforcement learning with decentralized planning to tackle this problem. We introduce a hierarchical framework consisting of a high-level planning module and a low-level execution module, where agents learn to communicate and coordinate their actions using a deep Q-network. Experimental results on a decentralized resource allocation problem demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
