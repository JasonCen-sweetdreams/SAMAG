Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, which aims to improve the retrieval performance by reformulating the original query. Traditional query expansion methods rely on statistical techniques, which may not capture the semantic relationships between query terms effectively. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, which can learn to identify relevant expansion terms from a large corpus of text. Our approach, called 'NeuroExp', utilizes a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query term embeddings and expansion term selection. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroExp significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision.
