This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'QRIM', that incorporates query-document interaction into the ranking process for ad-hoc retrieval tasks. QRIM uses a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture complex contextual relationships between query terms and document passages. We demonstrate that QRIM outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models on several benchmarks, including the TREC CAR dataset. Furthermore, we show that QRIM's query-document interaction module improves the model's ability to generalize to unseen queries and documents.
