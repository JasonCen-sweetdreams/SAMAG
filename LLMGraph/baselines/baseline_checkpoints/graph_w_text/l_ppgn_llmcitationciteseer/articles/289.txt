Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, yet its effectiveness is often hindered by the lack of nuanced term dependencies. This paper presents a novel neural-based approach, TermDep, which captures contextual relationships between terms using graph convolutional networks. By integrating TermDep into a state-of-the-art query expansion framework, we demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance on several benchmark datasets. Our analysis reveals that TermDep better captures latent term associations, leading to more informative and diverse expanded queries.
