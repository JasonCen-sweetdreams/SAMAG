As the global population ages, there is a growing need to design accessible interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a novel multimodal interaction framework that integrates speech, gesture, and gaze inputs to accommodate varying cognitive abilities. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults and found that our framework significantly improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional unimodal interfaces. We also provide guidelines for designers to create accessible multimodal interfaces that cater to the diverse needs of older adults.
