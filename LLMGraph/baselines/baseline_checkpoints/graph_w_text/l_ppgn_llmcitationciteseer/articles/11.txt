This paper explores the application of deep reinforcement learning to coordinate multi-agent systems in complex, dynamic environments. We propose a novel architecture, 'MARL-COM', which combines a centralized critic with decentralized actor networks to learn effective coordination policies. Our approach leverages attention mechanisms to focus on relevant agents and incorporates curriculum learning to adapt to changing task requirements. Experimental results in a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate improved coordination efficiency and scalability compared to traditional decentralized MARL methods.
