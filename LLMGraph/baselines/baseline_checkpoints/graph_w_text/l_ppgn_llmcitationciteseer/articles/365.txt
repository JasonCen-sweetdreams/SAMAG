Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in DDS remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of data distribution and communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, called GraphIX, which models the data distribution and query patterns in a DDS as a graph. GraphIX leverages graph algorithms to identify optimal query execution plans, reducing the communication overhead and improving query response times. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that GraphIX outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques in DDS by up to 3x.
