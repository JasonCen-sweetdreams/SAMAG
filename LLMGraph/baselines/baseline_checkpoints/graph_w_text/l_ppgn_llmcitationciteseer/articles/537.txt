Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem due to the complexities of distributed query planning and execution. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the DDS environment and receiving rewards based on query execution performance. Our experiments on a real-world DDS dataset demonstrate that the RL-based query optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
