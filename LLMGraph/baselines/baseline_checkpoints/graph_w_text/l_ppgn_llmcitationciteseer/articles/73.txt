Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on heuristics or manual feature engineering. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DRL-QE', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query expansion policy. Our model learns to select the most informative terms to add to the original query, leading to significant improvements in retrieval performance. We evaluate DRL-QE on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in retrieving relevant documents, particularly for short and ambiguous queries.
