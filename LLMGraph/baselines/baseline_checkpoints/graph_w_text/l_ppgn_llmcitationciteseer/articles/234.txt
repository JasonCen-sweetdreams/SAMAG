In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel distributed approach, 'GraphMA', which leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn task allocation strategies for heterogeneous agents. GraphMA represents the agent network as a graph and uses GNNs to learn a latent representation of agent capabilities and task requirements. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that GraphMA outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization, while adapting to dynamic changes in the agent network.
