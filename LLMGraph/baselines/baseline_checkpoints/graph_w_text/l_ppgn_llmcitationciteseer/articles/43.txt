The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors has led to an explosion of time-series data, posing significant challenges for efficient data management. Existing indexing techniques struggle to balance query performance and storage overhead. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'TS-Tree', which leverages a hierarchical, adaptive partitioning scheme and a compact, bit-packed representation. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TS-Tree outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query latency and 2x in storage efficiency, while maintaining strong scalability and fault tolerance.
