Image search has become an essential component of modern information retrieval systems. However, existing approaches often rely on hand-crafted features or complex deep learning models, leading to suboptimal performance or computational inefficiency. This paper proposes a hybrid retrieval model, 'Hydra', that leverages both traditional computer vision features and deep visual features extracted from convolutional neural networks. Hydra combines the strengths of both approaches using a novel fusion mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. We also introduce a query expansion strategy that adaptively refines the search results based on user feedback, further improving the model's effectiveness.
