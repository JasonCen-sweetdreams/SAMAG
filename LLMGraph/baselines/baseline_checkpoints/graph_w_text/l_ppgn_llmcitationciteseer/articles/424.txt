Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly being adopted in educational settings, but the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user engagement remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study investigating the effects of customized avatars on learners' sense of presence, motivation, and overall learning experience in a VR-based learning environment. Our results show that participants who interacted with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, reported greater enjoyment, and demonstrated improved knowledge retention compared to those using generic avatars. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of VR-based educational systems and highlight avenues for future research.
