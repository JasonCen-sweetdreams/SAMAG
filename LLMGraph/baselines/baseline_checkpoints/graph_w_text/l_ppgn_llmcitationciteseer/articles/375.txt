Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence, as it enables organizations to make timely decisions based on fresh data. However, skewed datasets can severely degrade query performance, leading to unacceptable latency. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'SkewOpt', which leverages advanced statistical methods to detect and mitigate skew in RTDW. SkewOpt incorporates a cost-based optimization algorithm that iteratively refines query plans to minimize latency and maximize throughput. Experimental results on a large-scale RTDW system demonstrate that SkewOpt achieves significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
