Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability and accessibility for older adults remain a concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an inclusive voice assistant, focusing on speech recognition and dialogue management. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, exploring their communication patterns, speech characteristics, and preferences for voice interactions. Our findings inform the design of a novel dialogue management framework that accommodates age-related speech difficulties, incorporates empathy and feedback mechanisms, and prioritizes transparency and control. We evaluated our prototype with 20 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
