Coordinating multiple agents in complex environments is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a novel approach using hierarchical graph attention networks (HGATs) to learn effective coordination strategies. Our HGAT model consists of a hierarchical graph structure that captures agent interactions at multiple scales, and attention mechanisms that focus on relevant agents and their relationships. We evaluate our approach on a variety of coordination tasks, including traffic management and resource allocation, and demonstrate significant improvements in performance and scalability compared to existing methods.
