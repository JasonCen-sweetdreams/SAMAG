Multi-stakeholder decision making (MSDM) is a complex problem that requires efficient negotiation strategies to reach mutually beneficial agreements. This paper proposes a novel autonomous agent-based negotiation framework, 'aNego', which leverages reinforcement learning and graph-based reasoning to facilitate effective negotiation between multiple stakeholders. aNego agents learn to identify and prioritize stakeholder interests, generate counter-proposals, and adapt to changing negotiation contexts. Experimental results on a simulated MSDM scenario demonstrate that aNego outperforms traditional negotiation protocols in terms of agreement quality, negotiation speed, and stakeholder satisfaction.
