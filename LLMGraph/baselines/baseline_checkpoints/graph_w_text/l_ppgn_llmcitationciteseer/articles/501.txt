Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, where query expansion techniques are often employed to improve retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel neural query graph embedding approach, termed 'NQGE', which learns to represent queries as dense graph embeddings. By leveraging these embeddings, we develop an efficient query expansion method that selectively incorporates relevant terms from the top-retrieved documents. Experimental results on several standard ad-hoc retrieval datasets demonstrate that NQGE significantly outperforms existing query expansion methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of MAP and NDCG metrics.
