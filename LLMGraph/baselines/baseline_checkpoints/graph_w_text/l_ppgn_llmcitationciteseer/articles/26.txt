This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework for multi-agent systems, leveraging auction-based mechanisms to optimize task assignments. Our approach, called 'AuctionMAS', enables agents to bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences, while ensuring fairness and efficiency through a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auction mechanism. We evaluate AuctionMAS in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized allocation methods. Theoretical analysis and experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach in large-scale, dynamic multi-agent environments.
