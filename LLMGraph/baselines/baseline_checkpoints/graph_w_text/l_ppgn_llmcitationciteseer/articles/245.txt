Entity matching is a crucial step in data integration, where the goal is to identify duplicate records referring to the same real-world entity. Traditional approaches rely on hand-crafted similarity metrics, which can be ineffective in handling complex data variations. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'DeepMatch', that learns similarity metrics from data. We design a siamese network architecture that captures both local and global patterns in entity data, enabling accurate matching at scale. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 15% in terms of F1-score, while reducing the need for manual feature engineering.
