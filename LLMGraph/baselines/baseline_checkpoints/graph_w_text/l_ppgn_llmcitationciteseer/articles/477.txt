Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph-based applications, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised significant concerns. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approach to improve the robustness of GNNs against graph perturbations. We introduce a probabilistic graph mutation strategy that generates a distribution of perturbed graphs, allowing the GNN to learn from diverse, adversarial scenarios. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the robustness of GNNs against various types of graph attacks, while maintaining their performance on clean graphs.
