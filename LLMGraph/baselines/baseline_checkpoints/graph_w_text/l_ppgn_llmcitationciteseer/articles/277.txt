Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, existing VR systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this population. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences tailored to older adults with cognitive impairments. We conducted a user-centered design study with 20 participants, identifying key challenges and opportunities for VR interaction. Our results inform the development of a set of design guidelines and recommendations for creating accessible and engaging VR experiences. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a prototype VR system, which shows significant improvements in user engagement and cognitive load reduction.
