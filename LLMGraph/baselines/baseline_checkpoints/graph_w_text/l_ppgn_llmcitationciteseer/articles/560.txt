Cold start problem in recommendation systems hinders the performance of collaborative filtering-based models. This paper proposes a hybrid retrieval model that combines the strengths of content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to tackle the cold start problem. The proposed model uses a neural network-based retrieval module to generate item embeddings and a matrix factorization-based ranking module to generate personalized rankings. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of precision, recall, and A/B testing metrics.
