Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem due to the complexity of agent interactions and the need for efficient decision-making. This paper proposes a novel decentralized task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model agent relationships and allocate tasks. Our approach, called 'GraphAgent', uses a hierarchical GNN architecture to learn a representation of the agent graph and predict task assignments. We evaluate GraphAgent on a variety of scenarios, including robotic search and rescue, and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving near-optimal task allocations while reducing communication overhead.
