Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging problem in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion (QE) is a widely used technique to improve retrieval effectiveness. However, existing QE methods rely on handcrafted features and heuristics, which may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning framework, 'DRL-QE', which learns to expand queries by maximizing a reward function that incorporates retrieval metrics. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DRL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
