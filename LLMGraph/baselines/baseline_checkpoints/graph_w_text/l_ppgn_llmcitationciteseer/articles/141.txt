Virtual reality (VR) systems have become increasingly popular, but the impact of personalized avatar representation on user experience remains understudied. This paper presents a mixed-methods study that investigates how customized avatar features influence user presence, engagement, and emotional responses in VR environments. Our results show that users who created personalized avatars reported higher levels of presence and enjoyment compared to those with default avatars. Furthermore, we identify specific design factors, such as facial similarity and body type, that significantly affect user experience. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems and avatar representation in various domains, including gaming, education, and therapy.
