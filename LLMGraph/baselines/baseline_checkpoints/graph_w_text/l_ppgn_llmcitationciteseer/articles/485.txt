In multi-agent systems, secure coordination is crucial to prevent malicious attacks and maintain confidentiality. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'SecureAgent', which leverages homomorphic encryption and multi-party computation to enable secure coordination among agents. We design a protocol that allows agents to jointly compute a coordination plan while maintaining the secrecy of their individual inputs. Our evaluation on a real-world supply chain management scenario demonstrates that SecureAgent reduces the risk of collusion attacks by 95% compared to traditional encryption schemes, while incurring only a moderate overhead in computation time.
