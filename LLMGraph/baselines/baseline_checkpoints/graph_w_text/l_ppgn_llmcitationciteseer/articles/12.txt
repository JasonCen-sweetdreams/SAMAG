Decentralized multi-agent systems (DMAS) are increasingly used in various applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, and smart grids. However, task allocation in DMAS remains a challenging problem, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper proposes a novel approach to autonomous task allocation using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We develop a decentralized DRL framework that enables agents to learn task allocation policies through interactions with their environment and other agents. Our approach is evaluated in a simulated environment, demonstrating improved task allocation efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional methods.
