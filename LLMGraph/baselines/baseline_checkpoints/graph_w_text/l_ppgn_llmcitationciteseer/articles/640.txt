Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems rely on hand-crafted features and ranking models, which often fail to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural network (HNN) architecture for IR, which learns to represent documents and queries in a shared latent space. Our approach leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant document segments, enabling more accurate retrieval of top-ranked documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our HNN-based IR system, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline models in terms of recall and mean average precision.
