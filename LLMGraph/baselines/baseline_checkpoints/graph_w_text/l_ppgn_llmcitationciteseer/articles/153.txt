Conventional neural ranking models for document retrieval suffer from high computational costs and limited scalability. This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HierRank', which leverages a dual-encoder architecture to efficiently process large document collections. HierRank first employs a coarse-grained relevance scorer to filter out irrelevant documents, and then applies a fine-grained ranking model to the remaining candidates. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierRank achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency while maintaining competitive ranking performance compared to state-of-the-art neural models.
