This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for autonomous task allocation in multi-robot systems. The proposed approach, called Hierarchical Task Allocation (HTA), decomposes complex tasks into smaller sub-tasks and allocates them to individual robots based on their capabilities and environmental constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HTA in a simulated warehouse scenario, where multiple robots collaborate to fulfill customer orders. Experimental results show that HTA achieves significant improvements in task completion efficiency and adaptability to changing environmental conditions compared to traditional centralized allocation methods.
