The proliferation of IoT devices has led to a surge in heterogeneous data sources, posing significant challenges for data integration and analysis. This paper proposes a novel graph-based data modeling approach, called 'IoTGraph', which enables scalable and efficient data integration for IoT devices. IoTGraph represents device data as a graph, allowing for flexible schema evolution and support for diverse data formats. We evaluate IoTGraph on a large-scale IoT dataset and demonstrate improved data integration performance and reduced data inconsistency compared to traditional relational database approaches.
