Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often rely on simplistic term weighting schemes or shallow learning models. This paper proposes a novel deep neural latent topic modeling approach, 'NeuroTE', which jointly learns topic representations and query-document relevance. We leverage a hierarchical variational autoencoder to capture complex topic relationships and a neural ranking model to optimize retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroTE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, particularly for queries with ambiguous or nuanced semantics.
