The proliferation of heterogeneous information networks (HINs) has created new challenges for semantic search. Existing query expansion methods often suffer from high computational complexity and limited contextual understanding. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, HQE-HIN, which leverages the hierarchical structure of HINs to efficiently expand queries. Our approach incorporates semantic role labeling and graph attention mechanisms to capture nuanced relationships between entities and concepts. Experimental results on a large-scale HIN dataset demonstrate that HQE-HIN achieves significant improvements in search accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
