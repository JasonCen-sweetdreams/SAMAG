Session-based recommendation systems (SRS) aim to predict the next item a user will interact with based on their current session. Graph-based methods have shown promise in SRS, but struggle to capture complex item relationships and user behavior. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that models user sessions as hierarchical graphs, incorporating both item and session-level attention mechanisms. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art SRS methods, achieving significant improvements in precision and recall.
