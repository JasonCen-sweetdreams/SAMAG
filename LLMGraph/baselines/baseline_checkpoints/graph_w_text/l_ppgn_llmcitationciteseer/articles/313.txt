Task allocation is a fundamental problem in multi-agent systems, where autonomous agents need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. This paper proposes a decentralized auction-based mechanism, 'MAAT', for task allocation in dynamic environments. MAAT leverages a novel bidding strategy that takes into account agent capabilities, task urgency, and inter-agent dependencies. We prove the optimality and stability of MAAT under various task and agent distributions. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that MAAT outperforms centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and adaptability to changing conditions.
