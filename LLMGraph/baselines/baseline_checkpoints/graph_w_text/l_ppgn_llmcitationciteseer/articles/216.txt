As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible and usable conversational interfaces that cater to the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces, focusing on the specific challenges and requirements of older adults. We conducted a series of user studies and co-design workshops with older adults to identify key design principles and guidelines for creating accessible and engaging conversational interfaces. Our findings highlight the importance of simplicity, clarity, and flexibility in interface design, and provide recommendations for incorporating these principles into conversational AI systems.
