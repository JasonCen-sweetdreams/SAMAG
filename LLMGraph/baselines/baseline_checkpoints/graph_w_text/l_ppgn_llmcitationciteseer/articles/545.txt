Traditional query expansion techniques often neglect the contextual information associated with user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion framework, 'CAQE', which incorporates both semantic and spatial contextual features to refine the query representation. We introduce a graph-based approach to model the relationships between query terms, entities, and spatial locations, enabling more effective retrieval of relevant documents. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods in terms of precision and recall.
