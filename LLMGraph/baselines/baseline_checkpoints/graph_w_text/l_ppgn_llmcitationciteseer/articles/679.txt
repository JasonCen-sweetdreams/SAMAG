Resource allocation in cloud computing is a complex optimization problem that requires efficient management of resources to minimize costs and maximize performance. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'CloudOpt', which learns to allocate resources dynamically based on workload patterns and system constraints. We employ a hybrid DRL architecture that combines the strengths of actor-critic methods and graph neural networks to model complex dependencies between resources and workloads. Experimental results on a real-world cloud dataset demonstrate that CloudOpt achieves significant improvements in resource utilization and response time compared to traditional optimization techniques.
