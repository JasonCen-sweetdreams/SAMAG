This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous negotiation strategies for multi-agent systems in dynamic environments. We propose a hybrid framework that combines machine learning and game-theoretic techniques to enable agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and negotiate with each other effectively. Our approach is evaluated in a simulated smart grid scenario, where agents representing households and energy providers negotiate energy trading prices and quantities. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional negotiation strategies in terms of social welfare, fairness, and convergence time.
