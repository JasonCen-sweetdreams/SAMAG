Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of daily life, but individuals with visual impairments often face significant barriers to accessing VR experiences. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'AccessibleVR', a novel VR interface that leverages auditory and haptic cues to facilitate navigation and interaction for visually impaired users. We conduct a user study with 20 participants and demonstrate that AccessibleVR significantly improves task completion rates and subjective user experience compared to standard VR interfaces. Our findings inform the development of inclusive VR systems that can empower individuals with visual impairments.
