Task allocation in multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, particularly in scenarios where agents have diverse capabilities and tasks require complex coordination. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn coordinated task allocation policies. We represent the agent-task assignments as a graph and leverage GNNs to capture the structural dependencies between agents and tasks. Our approach, called Coordinated Task Allocation Network (CTAN), outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and adaptability to changing task requirements. We evaluate CTAN on several synthetic and real-world multi-agent domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in complex coordination scenarios.
