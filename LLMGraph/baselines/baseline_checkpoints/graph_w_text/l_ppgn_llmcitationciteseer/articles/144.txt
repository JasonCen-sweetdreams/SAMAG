In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to enable individual agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and learn from their experiences. Our approach, dubbed 'DRL-TA', uses a novel graph attention mechanism to model agent-agent interactions and task dependencies, allowing agents to make informed decisions about task assignment. Experimental results on a realistic logistics scenario demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in terms of task completion efficiency and robustness to agent failures.
