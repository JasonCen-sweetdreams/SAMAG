This paper presents a novel approach to document retrieval, which leverages semantic embeddings and hierarchical clustering to improve search efficiency and relevance. We introduce a neural network-based model that learns to represent documents as dense vectors, capturing their semantic relationships and facilitating fast similarity searches. Our method is further enhanced by a hierarchical clustering algorithm, which organizes the document collection into a navigation-friendly structure. Experimental results on a large-scale text dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and query response time compared to traditional keyword-based search methods.
