Recommender systems have become ubiquitous in modern online services, but their lack of transparency hinders user trust and accountability. This paper proposes a novel graph attention network, 'HGAN', which incorporates hierarchical graph structures to model complex user-item relationships. By learning attention weights at multiple scales, HGAN provides intuitive explanations for its recommendations, improving user satisfaction and reducing bias. We evaluate HGAN on three real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
