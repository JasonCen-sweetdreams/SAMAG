Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our lives, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of personalized avatars on user experience and engagement in VR environments. We designed and implemented a novel avatar creation system that incorporates user preferences, personality traits, and physical characteristics. Our user study involving 120 participants shows that personalized avatars significantly increase user engagement, presence, and overall satisfaction in VR applications. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems and applications.
