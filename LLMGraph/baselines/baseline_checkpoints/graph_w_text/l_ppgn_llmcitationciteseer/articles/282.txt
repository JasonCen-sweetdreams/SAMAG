Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, requiring models to adapt quickly to new tasks with limited data. This paper proposes a novel deep meta-learning approach, 'TaskEMB', which learns task-aware embeddings that capture the essence of each task. Our framework consists of a meta-learner that generates task-specific weights, and a task-encoder that produces embeddings based on the task description. We evaluate TaskEMB on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance and demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen tasks. Furthermore, we analyze the learned embeddings, revealing insights into the task structure and relationships.
