This paper presents a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems using graph attention networks. The proposed method, 'GAT-Allocator', leverages the structural properties of the agent interaction graph to efficiently allocate tasks to agents while minimizing communication overhead. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GAT-Allocator in various simulated scenarios and show that it outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization. Theoretical analysis and experiments validate the scalability and robustness of our approach in real-world applications.
