Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various graph-based tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised concerns about their reliability. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Graph Refinement (HGR), to enhance the robustness of GNNs against adversarial attacks. HGR iteratively refines the graph structure by identifying and pruning suspicious nodes and edges, leading to improved robustness against various types of attacks. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGR in improving the robustness of GNNs, outperforming existing defense methods.
