Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in such systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing technique, 'DynaIndex', which dynamically adjusts the index structure based on query patterns and data distribution. Our approach leverages machine learning algorithms to predict query loads and optimize index maintenance, resulting in significant performance improvements. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database setup demonstrate that DynaIndex outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
