Temporal graph databases have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to model complex relationships between entities across time. However, efficient querying and indexing of such databases remain challenging tasks. This paper proposes a novel indexing scheme, 'TempoIndex', which leverages a combination of timestamp-based partitioning and graph-based clustering to accelerate query execution. We also present a query optimization framework that rewrites temporal graph queries to minimize the number of index lookups. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that TempoIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response times.
