Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are designed to scale with large document collections, but they often suffer from high query latency due to the overhead of inter-node communication. This paper presents a novel approach to reduce query response time in DIR systems by applying hierarchical clustering to the document collection. Our method, called 'HierDIR', groups documents into clusters based on their semantic similarity and assigns each cluster to a specific node in the system. Experimental results on a large-scale document dataset show that HierDIR reduces query latency by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art DIR systems while maintaining comparable retrieval effectiveness.
