Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize remote communication by providing an immersive and interactive environment. However, the impact of embodiment on social presence in VR-mediated communication remains understudied. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the effects of embodied avatars on social presence, trust, and rapport-building in VR-mediated dyadic conversations. Our results show that participants in embodied conditions reported higher social presence and trust compared to non-embodied conditions, with significant implications for the design of VR-based communication systems.
