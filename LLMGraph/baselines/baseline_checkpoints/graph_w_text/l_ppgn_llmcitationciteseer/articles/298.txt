Distributed search systems struggle to balance query latency and result relevance. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion (HQE) approach that leverages local indexing and global aggregation to efficiently retrieve documents. HQE employs a probabilistic topic modeling scheme to identify latent concepts in the query and expand it with relevant terms, reducing the search space while preserving result accuracy. Experimental evaluation on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrates a 30% reduction in query latency and a 15% improvement in mean average precision compared to state-of-the-art methods.
