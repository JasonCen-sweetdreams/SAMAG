This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning. We propose a novel algorithm, 'MARA', which enables agents to learn cooperative policies for task assignment in a distributed manner. MARA utilizes a decentralized actor-critic architecture, where each agent learns to select tasks based on local observations and communication with neighboring agents. We evaluate MARA in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
