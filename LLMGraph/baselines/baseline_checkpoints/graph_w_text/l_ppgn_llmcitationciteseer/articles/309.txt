Distributed database systems face significant performance challenges due to data fragmentation and network latency. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing approach, 'DynIndex', which dynamically adjusts the index structure based on query patterns and data distribution. We introduce a novel cost model that captures the trade-offs between index maintenance, query optimization, and data consistency. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that DynIndex improves query performance by up to 3x compared to traditional indexing methods, while minimizing index maintenance overhead.
