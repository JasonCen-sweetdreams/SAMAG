In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is crucial for achieving complex tasks. However, existing approaches typically assume complete information about agent capabilities and preferences. This paper presents a novel framework for dynamic coalition formation in the presence of incomplete information. We propose a probabilistic modeling approach to estimate agent characteristics and develop a distributed algorithm for coalition formation that adapts to changing environment and agent availability. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead.
