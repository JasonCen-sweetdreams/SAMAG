Cooperative autonomous agents have numerous applications in areas such as robotics, smart cities, and disaster response. Effective task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals, but centralized approaches can be brittle and vulnerable to single-point failures. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, preferences, and resource constraints. We propose a novel DCOP algorithm that incorporates agent heterogeneity, temporal constraints, and uncertainty awareness. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and robustness compared to existing decentralized task allocation methods.
