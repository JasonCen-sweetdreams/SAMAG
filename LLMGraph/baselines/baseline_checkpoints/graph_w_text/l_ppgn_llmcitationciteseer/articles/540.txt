Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has become a prominent approach in information retrieval, leveraging neural networks to encode documents and queries into dense vectors. However, indexing and searching these dense representations efficiently remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural indexing (HNI) method, which organizes documents into a hierarchical structure using a combination of clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HNI achieves significant speedup and storage reduction compared to existing indexing methods, while maintaining or improving retrieval performance.
