As robots become increasingly integrated into human workspaces, understanding the factors that influence trust in human-robot collaboration is crucial. This study explores the role of embodiment in shaping trust in robotic collaborators. We conducted a series of experiments where participants performed tasks with either an embodied robot or a non-embodied virtual agent. Our results show that embodiment significantly enhances trust in robotic collaborators, particularly in tasks requiring physical proximity. We also identify key design factors, such as robot appearance and movement patterns, that moderate this effect. The findings have implications for the design of robots that can effectively collaborate with humans in various domains.
