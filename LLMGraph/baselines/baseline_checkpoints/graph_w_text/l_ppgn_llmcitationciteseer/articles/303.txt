Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging task due to the complexity of graph data and the need to balance performance and resource utilization. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal query plans based on graph topology, data distribution, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource efficiency.
