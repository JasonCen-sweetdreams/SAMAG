Emotion recognition from multi-modal inputs (e.g., speech, text, and vision) remains a challenging task due to the complexity of human emotions and the variability of modalities. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of each modality to recognize emotions at multiple levels. Our HAN model consists of modality-specific encoders, a cross-modal attention module, and a hierarchical fusion mechanism. Experimental results on the benchmark EMOTIC dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recognizing emotions from multi-modal inputs, with a relative improvement of 12.5% in F1-score.
