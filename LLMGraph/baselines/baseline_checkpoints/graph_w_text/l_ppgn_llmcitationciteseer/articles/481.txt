This study investigates the effects of haptic feedback on user experience in virtual reality (VR) interfaces. We designed an experiment where participants performed a series of tasks in a VR environment with and without haptic feedback. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly improves user performance, reduces errors, and enhances overall user satisfaction. We also found that the type and intensity of haptic feedback influence user behavior, with vibrations and resistance forces being more effective than tactile feedback. Our findings have implications for the design of VR interfaces, suggesting that haptic feedback can be a valuable tool for improving user experience and engagement.
