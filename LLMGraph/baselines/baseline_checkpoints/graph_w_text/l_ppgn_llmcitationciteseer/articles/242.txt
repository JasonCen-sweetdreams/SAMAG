Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize assistive technology, but existing VR systems often overlook the needs of users with visual impairments. This paper presents 'AccessibleVR', a novel framework for designing and evaluating VR experiences that are inclusive of visually impaired users. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key usability challenges and developed a set of guidelines for accessible VR interaction design. Our evaluation shows thatAccessibleVR significantly improves user experience and task performance for visually impaired users, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in VR development.
