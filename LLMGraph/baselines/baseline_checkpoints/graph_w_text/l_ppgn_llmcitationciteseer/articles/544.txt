Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by inaccessible speech interfaces. This paper presents a user-centered design study focused on improving the accessibility of voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a series of co-design workshops and usability evaluations to identify critical design factors, including speech recognition accuracy, feedback mechanisms, and error recovery strategies. Our results highlight the importance of personalized speech profiles, multimodal feedback, and forgiving error handling in enabling older adults to effectively interact with voice assistants. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants and discuss implications for future research in this area.
