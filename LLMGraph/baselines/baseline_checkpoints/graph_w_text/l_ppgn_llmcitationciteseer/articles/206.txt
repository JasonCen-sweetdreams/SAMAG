Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to their ability to provide transparent and trustworthy suggestions to users. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) framework that leverages graph-based user-item interactions to generate personalized explanations for recommended items. HGAN consists of two main components: a graph attention encoder that captures complex relationships between users and items, and a hierarchical explanation generator that produces multi-level explanations for recommended items. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in improving recommendation accuracy and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
