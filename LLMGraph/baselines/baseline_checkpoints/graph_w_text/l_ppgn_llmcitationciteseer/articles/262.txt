Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their adoption is hindered by the lack of accessibility features for people with disabilities. This paper presents an investigation into the design of inclusive voice assistants, focusing on multimodal interaction mechanisms. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with individuals with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive disabilities to identify key accessibility barriers. Our findings inform the development of a novel interaction framework that integrates speech, gesture, and tactile modalities. We evaluate the framework through a usability study, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction for participants with disabilities.
