Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We model the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and employ a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn an optimal query execution plan. Our approach, called 'RL-Opt', adapts to changing workload patterns and database statistics, outperforming traditional optimization techniques in terms of query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-Opt in improving system performance and scalability.
