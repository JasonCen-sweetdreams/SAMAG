Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains limited. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant that accommodates the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to identify key challenges and opportunities. Our proposed design incorporates personalized cognitive supports, such as memory aids and error forgiveness, and evaluates the effectiveness of these features through a usability study. Results show significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction, highlighting the potential for voice assistants to promote digital inclusion for older adults.
