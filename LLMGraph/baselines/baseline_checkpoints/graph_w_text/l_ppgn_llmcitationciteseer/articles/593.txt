This study investigates the usability and accessibility of gestural interfaces for older adults with cognitive impairments. We designed and implemented a gestural interface using a 3D depth sensor and evaluated its performance with 30 participants aged 65-85 with mild cognitive impairments. Our results show that the interface significantly improved task completion time and accuracy compared to traditional mouse-based input. Furthermore, we identified key design guidelines for gestural interfaces tailored to this population, including the importance of intuitive gesture mapping and feedback mechanisms. Our findings have implications for the development of inclusive and supportive technologies for older adults with cognitive impairments.
