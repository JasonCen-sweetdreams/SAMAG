Explainable recommendation systems rely on knowledge graphs (KGs) to provide transparency into their decision-making processes. However, existing KG embedding methods suffer from scalability issues and limited interpretability. This paper introduces 'ExplainKG', a novel framework that leverages graph attention networks and sparse linear layers to learn efficient and interpretable KG embeddings. We evaluate ExplainKG on three real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and explainability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
