Search engines often struggle to provide diverse search results, leading to user dissatisfaction. This paper proposes an adaptive query expansion framework, 'AQEPlus', which integrates both semantic and statistical features to generate novel queries that better capture user intent. AQEPlus leverages a hybrid approach, combining word embeddings with statistical language models to identify relevant expansion terms. Our experimental evaluation on a large-scale web corpus demonstrates that AQEPlus significantly improves search result diversity, reaching an average of 35% more diverse results compared to state-of-the-art methods.
