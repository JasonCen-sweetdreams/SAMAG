Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for many applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper introduces HTAN, a hierarchical attention network that detects anomalies while providing insights into the contributing factors. HTAN consists of a stacked encoder-decoder architecture with multi-level attention mechanisms, enabling the model to focus on relevant segments and features. We demonstrate HTAN's effectiveness on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering visual explanations for detected anomalies.
