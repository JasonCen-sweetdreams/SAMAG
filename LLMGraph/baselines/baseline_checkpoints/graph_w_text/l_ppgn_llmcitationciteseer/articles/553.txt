In multi-agent systems, effective task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinated task allocation using reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework where agents learn to allocate tasks based on their capabilities, resource constraints, and communication with neighboring agents. Experimental results on a real-world logistics scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of task completion rate, resource utilization, and adaptability to dynamic changes.
