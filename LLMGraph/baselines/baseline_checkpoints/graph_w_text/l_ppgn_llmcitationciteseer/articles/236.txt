Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become increasingly prevalent in many AI applications, but their temporal nature poses significant challenges for efficient embedding and inference. This paper introduces HiGATE, a novel hierarchical graph attention network for scalable temporal KG embedding. HiGATE leverages a graph attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant temporal dependencies and adaptively aggregate entity representations across different granularities. Our extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiGATE achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction and entity classification tasks while reducing computational overhead by up to 40% compared to existing methods.
