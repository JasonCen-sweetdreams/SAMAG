In multi-agent systems, allocating tasks efficiently among heterogeneous agents is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous task allocation using deep reinforcement learning. We propose a decentralized framework, 'MARL-TA', which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to adaptively allocate tasks based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and environmental dynamics. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that MARL-TA outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods, achieving improved task completion rates and reduced response times.
