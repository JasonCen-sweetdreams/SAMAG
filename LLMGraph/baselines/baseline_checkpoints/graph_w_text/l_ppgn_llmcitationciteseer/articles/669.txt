In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. Existing methods often rely on centralized controllers or assume a complete communication graph, limiting their scalability and applicability. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'GATask', which leverages graph attention networks to learn agent-specific representations and allocate tasks based on local observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GATask in various benchmarks, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to state-of-the-art methods.
