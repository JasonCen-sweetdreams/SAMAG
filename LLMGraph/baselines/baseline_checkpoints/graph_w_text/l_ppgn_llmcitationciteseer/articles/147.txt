Distributed databases are increasingly common in modern data management systems, but efficient query processing remains a significant challenge. This paper addresses the problem of multi-dimensional range queries, which are critical in various applications such as spatial databases and data analytics. We propose a novel indexing technique, 'DRIE', which leverages the distributed nature of the database to reduce query latency and improve scalability. DRIE uses a hierarchical indexing structure that adaptively partitions the data space based on query patterns, resulting in significant performance gains compared to existing indexing methods. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DRIE in reducing query response times and improving system throughput.
