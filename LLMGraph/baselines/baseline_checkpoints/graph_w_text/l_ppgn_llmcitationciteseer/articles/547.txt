In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework, 'DCTA', that leverages distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to allocate tasks to autonomous agents. DCTA utilizes a novel communication protocol that enables agents to iteratively exchange constraint information and converge to a feasible task allocation. We evaluate DCTA on a simulated robotics scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to centralized approaches.
