Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it significantly impacts the quality of search results. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks, which leverages the semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our model, 'NeuralQE', employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively emphasize relevant terms and passages in the document, resulting in more accurate and diverse query expansions. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that NeuralQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score.
