As Virtual Reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent in social interactions, understanding the impact of embodiment on social presence is crucial. This study explores how varying levels of embodiment in VR avatars influence users' feelings of social presence, trust, and cooperation in virtual mediated communication. We conducted a within-subjects experiment with 40 participants, using a 2x2 factorial design to manipulate avatar embodiment and task type. Results show that high-embodiment avatars significantly enhance social presence and trust, particularly in collaborative tasks. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based communication platforms and future research on social interaction in virtual environments.
