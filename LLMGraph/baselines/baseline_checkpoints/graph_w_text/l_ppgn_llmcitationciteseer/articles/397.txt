Distributed search engines face significant challenges in retrieving relevant documents from large-scale, heterogeneous collections. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) that leverages the strengths of both local and global context to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of document retrieval. Our approach integrates a hierarchical document representation with attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant segments and passages. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HAN achieves substantial improvements in retrieval performance and latency reduction compared to existing state-of-the-art models.
