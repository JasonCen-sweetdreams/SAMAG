Cooperative multi-agent systems often rely on negotiation and coordination to achieve shared goals. However, conflicts may arise when agents have differing preferences or goals. This paper introduces a novel conflict resolution framework, 'CoRe', which leverages graph-based reasoning to identify and resolve conflicts in real-time. CoRe incorporates a hybrid approach combining argumentation-based negotiation and machine learning-based prediction to improve conflict resolution efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate the efficacy of CoRe in reducing conflict rates and improving overall system performance.
