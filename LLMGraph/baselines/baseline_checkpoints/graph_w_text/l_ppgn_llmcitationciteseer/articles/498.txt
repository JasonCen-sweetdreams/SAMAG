In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. We present a novel hierarchical task allocation framework that considers temporal dependencies between tasks. Our approach leverages a graph-based representation of tasks and agents, and utilizes a recursive decomposition technique to allocate tasks at multiple levels of abstraction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulations on a logistics domain, showing significant improvements in task completion rate and agent utilization compared to existing flat allocation methods.
