Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to retrieve relevant documents given a user query. In this paper, we propose a neural query expansion approach that leverages BERT-based document embeddings to improve retrieval performance. Our method, NQE-BERT, uses a query-document interaction model to generate expansion terms, which are then weighted using a learned scoring function. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset show that NQE-BERT outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
