Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, energy, and healthcare. However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies in multivariate time-series data. This paper proposes a novel Graph Attention Network (GAT) architecture, dubbed HierGAT, which leverages both temporal and spatial dependencies to improve forecasting accuracy. We evaluate HierGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling missing values and non-stationary data.
