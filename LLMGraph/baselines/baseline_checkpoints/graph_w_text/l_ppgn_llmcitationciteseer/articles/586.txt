Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained significant attention in recent years, but existing methods often rely on simplistic user-item interactions or oversimplify complex relationships. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Graph Neural Network (HAGNN) framework that learns to generate fine-grained explanations for recommendations. By incorporating multi-level attention mechanisms and graph-based user modeling, HAGNN captures nuanced user preferences and item relationships, leading to improved recommendation accuracy and explanation quality. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN in ERS, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 12.5% in terms of explanation quality.
