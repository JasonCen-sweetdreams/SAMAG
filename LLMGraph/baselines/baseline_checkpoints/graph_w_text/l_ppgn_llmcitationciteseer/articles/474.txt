Node classification in dynamic graphs is a challenging task due to the constantly changing graph structure and node features. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) framework that captures both local and global graph structural information. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant nodes and their features at different scales, enabling more accurate node classification. Experimental results on several real-world dynamic graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN in improving node classification performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
