Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task with numerous applications. However, existing approaches struggle to handle large-scale datasets and complex patterns. This paper presents Hierarchical Temporal Convolutional Networks (HTCN), a novel deep learning framework for anomaly detection in univariate time series. HTCN leverages a hierarchical architecture to learn multi-scale temporal representations, enabling the detection of anomalies at varying frequencies. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that HTCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency.
