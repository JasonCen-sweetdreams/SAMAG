Context-aware information retrieval (CAIR) aims to retrieve documents relevant to a user's specific context. Existing methods rely on complex feature engineering and manual tuning of hyperparameters. We propose a novel hierarchical neural network (HNN) architecture that learns to rank documents based on contextual cues. Our HNN model consists of a document encoder, context encoder, and a ranking module that leverages both local and global contextual information. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in ranking performance and contextual awareness compared to state-of-the-art CAIR methods.
