Traditional information retrieval (IR) approaches often rely on hand-crafted features and linear models, which may not capture the complexities of natural language. We propose a deep neural network-based ranking model, 'DeepRank', that learns to represent documents and queries as dense vectors. Our architecture integrates a novel attention mechanism to weigh the importance of query terms and a hierarchical document encoder to capture multi-scale contextual information. Experiments on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate that DeepRank outperforms state-of-the-art IR models, achieving a 12% improvement in mean average precision.
