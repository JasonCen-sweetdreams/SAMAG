Virtual reality (VR) has tremendous potential for immersive experiences, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of personalized avatars on user engagement in VR environments. We designed an experiment with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar group or a generic avatar group. Our results show that users with personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, measured through self-reported surveys and behavioral metrics such as time spent in the VR environment. We also found that personalized avatars increased users' sense of presence and embodiment in the virtual environment. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of future VR applications.
