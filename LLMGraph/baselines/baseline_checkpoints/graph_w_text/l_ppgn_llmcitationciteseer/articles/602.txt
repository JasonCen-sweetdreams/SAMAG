Virtual reality (VR) gaming has gained immense popularity, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the effect of haptic feedback on user experience in VR games. We designed a novel haptic feedback system that simulates tactile sensations, such as texture and weight, and conducted a user study with 30 participants. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly increases user engagement, measured by gameplay duration and self-reported enjoyment. Furthermore, we found that haptic feedback enhances spatial awareness and reduces simulator sickness. The findings of this research have important implications for the design of immersive VR experiences.
