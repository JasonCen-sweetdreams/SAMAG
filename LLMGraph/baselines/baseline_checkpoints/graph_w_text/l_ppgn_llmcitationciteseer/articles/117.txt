Distributed database systems (DDS) are becoming increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query performance in DDS is a challenging task due to the complexities of resource allocation. This paper proposes an adaptive resource allocation framework, 'ARAF', that dynamically adjusts resource allocation based on query workload and system dynamics. ARAF uses a reinforcement learning approach to optimize query performance, reducing average query latency by up to 30% compared to existing static resource allocation strategies. Our evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of ARAF in improving query performance and system throughput.
