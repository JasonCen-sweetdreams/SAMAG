Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans in distributed database systems. We design a deep Q-network that learns to select optimal join orders and indexing strategies based on the query workload and system configuration. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 3x in terms of query execution time and resource utilization.
