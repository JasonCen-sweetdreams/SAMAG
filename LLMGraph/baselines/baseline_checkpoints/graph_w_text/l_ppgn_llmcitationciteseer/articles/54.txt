Graph-based neural networks have shown promise in information retrieval tasks, but their computational complexity hinders their application to large-scale document collections. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) architecture that leverages document hierarchies to reduce computational costs. Our approach represents documents as hierarchical graphs, where each node corresponds to a document segment, and employs a message-passing scheme to propagate semantic information. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that our HGNN-based retrieval model outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models while achieving significant speedups.
