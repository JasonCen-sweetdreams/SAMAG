Autonomous traffic management is a complex problem that requires coordinating multiple agents to optimize traffic flow. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to train a multi-agent system for autonomous traffic management. Our approach, 'TrafficCoor', utilizes a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) framework to model the interactions between agents. We employ a hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture that combines a high-level coordinator with low-level agent controllers. Experimental results on a realistic traffic simulation platform demonstrate that TrafficCoor significantly reduces travel time and increases traffic flow compared to state-of-the-art methods.
