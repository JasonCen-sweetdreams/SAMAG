As robots become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, understanding human-robot trust is crucial. This study explores the role of embodiment in virtual reality (VR) on human trust in robots. We conducted a user study with 60 participants, randomly assigning them to one of three conditions: (1) disembodied VR, (2) embodied VR with a robotic avatar, or (3) embodied VR with a humanoid avatar. Our results show that embodied VR with a humanoid avatar significantly increases trust in robots, particularly among participants with low prior experience with robots. We discuss the implications of these findings for designing trustworthy human-robot interfaces and highlight avenues for future research.
