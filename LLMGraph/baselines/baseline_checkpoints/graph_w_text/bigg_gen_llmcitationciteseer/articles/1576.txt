The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an exponential growth in sensor data, making real-time analytics a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'SensorIX', designed to efficiently process high-velocity IoT data streams. By leveraging a combination of Bloom filters and Hilbert curve-based indexing, SensorIX achieves a 3x improvement in query response time and a 2x reduction in storage requirements compared to existing indexing methods. We evaluate SensorIX on a large-scale IoT dataset and demonstrate its feasibility for real-time analytics on resource-constrained devices.
