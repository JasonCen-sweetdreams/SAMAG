Conversational agents have the potential to provide accessible mental health support, but their effectiveness hinges on their ability to understand and respond empathetically to users' emotional needs. This paper presents a novel framework for designing emotionally intelligent conversational agents, which integrates cognitive architectures with affective computing and natural language processing techniques. We evaluate our approach through a user study, demonstrating that agents trained with our framework exhibit higher empathetic accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional chatbot designs.
