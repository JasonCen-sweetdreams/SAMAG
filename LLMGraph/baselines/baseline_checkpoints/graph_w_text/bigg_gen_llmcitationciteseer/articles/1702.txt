Distributed databases have become increasingly popular in modern data management systems, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to optimize query plans for distributed databases. We develop a neural network-based model that learns to predict optimal query plans based on historical query execution data. Our approach reduces the query optimization time by up to 75% compared to traditional cost-based optimization methods, while maintaining comparable query performance. We evaluate our approach on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate its scalability and efficiency.
