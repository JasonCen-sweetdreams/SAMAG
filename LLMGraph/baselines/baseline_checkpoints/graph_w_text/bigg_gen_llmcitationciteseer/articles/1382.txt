Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their usability for older adults is often limited due to cognitive, sensory, and motor impairments. This paper presents a multimodal interaction framework for voice assistants that incorporates visual, tactile, and gestural interfaces to support older adults. We conducted a user-centered design study with 20 older adults and developed a prototype that integrates spoken language, gesture recognition, and haptic feedback. Our evaluation results show significant improvements in task completion rates, user satisfaction, and accessibility for older adults with varying abilities.
