This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation for autonomous agents in complex environments. We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based framework that learns to allocate tasks to agents based on their capabilities, environment dynamics, and inter-agent dependencies. Our approach leverages the structural properties of the agent communication graph to improve task allocation efficiency and adaptability. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional optimization-based approaches in terms of task completion rate and agent utilization.
