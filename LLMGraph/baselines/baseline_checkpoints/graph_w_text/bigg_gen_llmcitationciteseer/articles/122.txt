Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task in data analysis, but it becomes computationally expensive for high-dimensional data. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn hierarchical representations of data. Our method, called 'HierNet', uses a stacked autoencoder to learn a compact representation of the input data, followed by a hierarchical clustering algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HierNet on several benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements in clustering quality and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.
