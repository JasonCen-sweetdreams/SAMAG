Distributed relational databases are increasingly used in large-scale applications, but optimizing query execution plans remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed settings. Our method, called 'DROPS', uses a graph neural network to model the query plan space and a deep Q-network to learn an optimization policy. We evaluate DROPS on the TPC-DS benchmark and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, achieving an average speedup of 3.2x over the baseline.
