As smart home technology becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to ensure that these systems are accessible to older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an accessible smart home interface tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers to inform the design of our interface, which incorporates cognitive support features such as simplified language, visual cues, and error prevention mechanisms. Our user study results show that our interface significantly improves task completion rates and reduces user frustration compared to existing smart home interfaces.
