Short texts often lack contextual information, leading to ambiguity in entity disambiguation. This paper proposes a novel neural graph-based approach, GraphED, which expands queries by incorporating entity relationships and semantic knowledge. GraphED represents entities as nodes in a graph and learns to disambiguate them using a graph attention mechanism. Experimental results on short text datasets show that GraphED outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, improving retrieval effectiveness by up to 15%. Our approach has significant implications for search engines, question answering, and natural language processing applications.
