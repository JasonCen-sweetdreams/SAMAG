Distributed column-stores have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large datasets. However, optimizing query performance for multi-dimensional range queries remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'Hyperion', which leverages a combination of statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to efficiently prune the search space. We introduce a novel cost model that accurately estimates the execution time of range queries and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing optimization techniques. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that Hyperion achieves an average speedup of 3.2x over state-of-the-art query optimization methods.
