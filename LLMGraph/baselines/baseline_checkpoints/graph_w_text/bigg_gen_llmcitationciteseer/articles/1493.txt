Industrial IoT systems generate vast amounts of data, making anomaly detection a crucial task. This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Attention-based Explainable AI (HAXAI) framework for real-time anomaly detection. HAXAI leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant sensor readings and time-steps, while providing interpretable explanations for detected anomalies. We evaluate HAXAI on a real-world industrial dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting anomalies with high accuracy and latency, outperforming state-of-the-art baseline methods.
