The increasing volume and velocity of big data pose significant challenges to traditional data warehousing approaches. This paper presents a novel real-time data warehousing framework that leverages materialized view maintenance to ensure up-to-date analytics. We propose a hybrid indexing approach that combines bitmap indexing with a Delta- encoding scheme to efficiently store and update materialized views. Experimental results on a large-scale analytics workload demonstrate that our approach achieves an average query response time of 2.5 seconds, outperforming existing real-time data warehousing solutions by up to 3.2x.
