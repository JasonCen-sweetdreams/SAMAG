Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, requiring models to adapt to new classes with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical contrastive learning approach, 'HiCon', which leverages both inter-class and intra-class relationships to learn richer, more generalizable representations. Our method combines a hierarchical clustering module with a contrastive loss function, enabling the model to capture subtle patterns in the data. Experimental results on popular few-shot image classification benchmarks demonstrate that HiCon outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labeled examples.
