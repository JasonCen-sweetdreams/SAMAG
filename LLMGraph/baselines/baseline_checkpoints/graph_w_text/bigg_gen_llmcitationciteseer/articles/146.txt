In complex multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HRL-MA', which enables scalable and adaptive task allocation among agents. HRL-MA combines high-level planning with low-level execution, leveraging a hierarchical abstraction of the task space to reduce the complexity of the allocation problem. We evaluate HRL-MA in a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
