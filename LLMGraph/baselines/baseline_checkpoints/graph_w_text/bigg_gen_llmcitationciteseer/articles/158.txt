In distributed multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel decentralized approach, 'Distributed Constraint Optimization for Task Allocation' (DCOTA), which leverages distributed constraint optimization to allocate tasks to agents in a decentralized manner. DCOTA utilizes a combination of local search and message-passing algorithms to enable agents to negotiate and agree on task assignments, ensuring feasibility, optimality, and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DCOTA in various scenarios, including dynamic environments with changing task requirements and agent availability.
