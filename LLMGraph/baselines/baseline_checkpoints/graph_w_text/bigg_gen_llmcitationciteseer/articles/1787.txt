Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by difficulties in user interaction and error recovery. This study investigates the design of inclusive voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, exploring their experiences with a customized voice assistant prototype. Our results highlight the importance of intuitive error recovery mechanisms, clear feedback, and personalized assistance. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating more accessible and usable voice assistants, which can enhance the quality of life for older adults.
