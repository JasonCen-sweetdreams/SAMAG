Query optimization is a crucial task in distributed database systems, as it directly affects the performance and scalability of the system. Traditional query optimization techniques rely on rule-based or cost-based models, which may not adapt well to changing workloads and system dynamics. This paper proposes a novel adaptive query optimization approach using reinforcement learning, which learns to optimize queries based on feedback from the system. We design a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a query optimizer agent, which interacts with the database system to learn the optimal query plan. Our experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
