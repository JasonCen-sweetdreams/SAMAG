Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data processing. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in these systems. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for join reordering, which reduces the query execution time by minimizing the communication overhead between nodes. Our approach leverages graph theoretical concepts to model the join dependencies and develop an efficient reordering algorithm. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing join reordering techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
