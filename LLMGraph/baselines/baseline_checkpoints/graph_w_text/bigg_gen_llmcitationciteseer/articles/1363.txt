In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework, called 'AuctionMA', which leverages auction-based mechanisms to allocate tasks to agents with varying capabilities and preferences. AuctionMA incorporates a hierarchical clustering approach to group similar tasks and agents, reducing communication overhead and improving allocation efficiency. We evaluate AuctionMA through extensive simulations, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and agent satisfaction compared to existing decentralized allocation methods.
