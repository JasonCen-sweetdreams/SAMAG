Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. This paper presents a novel approach, called DPR-PR, which leverages deep learned dense representations to encode passages and questions. We explore the use of contrastive learning to train a dense retriever that can effectively capture the semantic relationships between questions and passages. Experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that DPR-PR outperforms state-of-the-art sparse retrieval methods, achieving a 15% increase in top-20 passage retrieval accuracy while reducing the indexing time by 3x.
