Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data processing. However, query optimization in DDS remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to optimize query execution plans based on feedback from the DDS environment. Our approach, called QOpt-RL, leverages a combination of exploration-exploitation strategies and graph neural networks to model the query optimization problem. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark show that QOpt-RL outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
