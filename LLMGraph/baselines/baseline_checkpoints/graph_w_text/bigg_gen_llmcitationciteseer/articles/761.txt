Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants for this demographic. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults to identify key challenges and preferences. Our findings inform the development of a novel voice assistant framework that incorporates age-related adaptations, such as acoustic models tailored to older adults' speech patterns and a simplified dialogue flow. A pilot study with 20 older adults demonstrates improved user experience and task completion rates compared to commercial voice assistants.
