Conversational interfaces have the potential to improve older adults' access to information and services. However, existing systems often neglect the unique needs and abilities of this demographic. This paper presents a novel multimodal fusion approach that integrates speech, gaze, and gesture inputs to create a more inclusive and accessible conversational interface. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults and found that our system improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional speech-only interfaces. Our results highlight the importance of considering the diverse abilities and preferences of older adults in the design of conversational interfaces.
