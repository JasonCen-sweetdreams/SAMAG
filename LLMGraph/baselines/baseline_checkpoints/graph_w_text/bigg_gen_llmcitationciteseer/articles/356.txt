Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art results in information retrieval tasks, but their document representation schemes often suffer from high computational costs and ignore the hierarchical structure of documents. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention mechanism, 'HAttDoc', which encodes documents as hierarchical representations, capturing both local and global contextual information. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HAttDoc outperforms existing document representation methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and effectiveness.
