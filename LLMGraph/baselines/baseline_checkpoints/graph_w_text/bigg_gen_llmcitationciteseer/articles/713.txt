Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query processing remains a bottleneck due to the complexity of graph traversal and join operations. This paper proposes an adaptive partitioning strategy, 'GraphPart', which dynamically adjusts the data distribution and query routing based on workload characteristics and system resources. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world social network dataset demonstrates that GraphPart achieves up to 3x performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art distributed graph processing systems.
