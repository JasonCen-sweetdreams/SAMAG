Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval (IR) systems, as it aims to capture the underlying intent of a user's query. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and hand-crafted rules, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel neural embedding-based approach, 'NeuroQE', which learns to expand queries in a dense vector space. We leverage a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query representation, expansion, and ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 15%.
