Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) requires capturing complex relationships between entities. Existing KG embedding methods struggle to scale to large graphs and often neglect the role of entity types in MHQA. This paper presents 'TypeHop', a novel KG embedding framework that leverages entity type information to learn more expressive and efficient representations. TypeHop consists of a hierarchical entity type encoding scheme and a knowledge graph attention mechanism that selectively focuses on relevant entities and relations during question answering. Experiments on popular MHQA benchmarks demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and inference time compared to state-of-the-art methods.
