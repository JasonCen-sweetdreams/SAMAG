This paper presents a novel hybrid retrieval model, 'HQER', which integrates the strengths of traditional term-based retrieval and neural ranking models. HQER employs deep query embeddings to capture complex semantic relationships between queries and documents, while leveraging a term-based retrieval component to efficiently filter out irrelevant documents. Our experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HQER achieves significant improvements in ranking effectiveness and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art neural ranking models, with a 23% increase in MRR@10 and a 40% reduction in computational cost.
