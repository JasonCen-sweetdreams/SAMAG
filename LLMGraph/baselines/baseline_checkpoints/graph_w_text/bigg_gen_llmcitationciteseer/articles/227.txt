Distributed databases face the challenge of optimizing query performance while handling large volumes of data. This paper introduces AIDA, an adaptive indexing framework that dynamically adjusts indexing strategies based on query patterns and data distributions. AIDA leverages machine learning models to predict query frequencies and optimize index creation, resulting in significant improvements in query response times. We evaluate AIDA on a real-world distributed database system and demonstrate an average query performance improvement of 30% compared to traditional indexing approaches.
