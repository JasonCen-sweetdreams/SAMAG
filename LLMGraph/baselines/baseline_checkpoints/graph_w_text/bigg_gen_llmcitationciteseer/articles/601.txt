In multi-agent systems, conflicts arise when agents with competing goals interact. Existing approaches to conflict resolution rely on hand-coded rules or limited problem-specific solutions. This paper proposes a novel approach using deep reinforcement learning to train agents to resolve conflicts intelligently. Our method, called Multi-Agent Conflict Resolution (MACR), utilizes a decentralized, self-organizing framework that adapts to diverse conflict scenarios. We evaluate MACR on a suite of benchmark problems, demonstrating improved conflict resolution rates and reduced negotiation time compared to state-of-the-art methods.
