Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising results in node classification tasks, but they struggle to capture complex patterns in dynamic graphs. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages graph attention mechanisms at multiple scales to effectively model node representations in dynamic graphs. We introduce a hierarchical graph pooling strategy that adaptively selects the most informative nodes at each level, allowing HGAT to capture long-range dependencies and node correlations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in node classification tasks, especially in scenarios with frequent graph topology changes.
