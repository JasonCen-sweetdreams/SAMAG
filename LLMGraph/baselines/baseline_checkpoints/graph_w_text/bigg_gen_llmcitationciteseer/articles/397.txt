This paper addresses the problem of planning for multi-agent systems with uncertain goals in dynamic environments. We propose a hierarchical task network planning (HTNP) framework that integrates probabilistic goal reasoning and plan adaptation. Our approach enables agents to reason about uncertain goals, generate feasible plans, and adapt to changing environments. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating improved plan flexibility and robustness compared to traditional HTNP methods.
