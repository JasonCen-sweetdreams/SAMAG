Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches struggle with scalability and ambiguity resolution. We propose a novel framework, 'GraphDE', which leverages graph-based embeddings and hierarchical clustering to disambiguate entities. Our approach captures complex relationships between entities and their contexts, enabling accurate disambiguation even in the presence of ambiguous mentions. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that GraphDE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.
