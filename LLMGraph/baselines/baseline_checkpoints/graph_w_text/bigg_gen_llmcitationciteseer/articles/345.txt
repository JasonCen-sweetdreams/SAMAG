Conversational AI systems have made significant progress in recent years, but their lack of transparency and explainability hinders their widespread adoption. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention-based framework for dialogue systems, which generates explicit explanations for its responses. Our approach incorporates multiple levels of attention, enabling the model to focus on relevant context, intent, and entities during response generation. We evaluate our approach on a benchmark dialogue dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in response quality, as well as enhanced transparency and trustworthiness. Our model provides a step towards more interpretable and accountable conversational AI systems.
