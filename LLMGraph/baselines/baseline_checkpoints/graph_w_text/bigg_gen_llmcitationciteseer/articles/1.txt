Individuals with motor impairments face significant barriers when interacting with technology. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of an adaptive gesture recognition system, ' GestureAid', designed to improve accessibility for users with varying levels of motor impairment. Our approach leverages machine learning to dynamically adjust gesture recognition thresholds based on user performance. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, including individuals with Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injuries. Results show that GestureAid significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy and user experience, with 85% of participants reporting increased confidence in using gestural interfaces.
