Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize accessibility, but existing VR interfaces often neglect the needs of users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel, inclusive VR interface framework that leverages audio and haptic cues to facilitate navigation and interaction for visually impaired users. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, comparing our framework to a conventional visual-based interface. Results show significant improvements in task completion time, accuracy, and user satisfaction. We discuss implications for designers and developers seeking to create more accessible VR experiences.
