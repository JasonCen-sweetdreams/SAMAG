Traditional indexing methods for information retrieval systems are limited by their reliance on exact matching, leading to inefficient query processing and poor scalability. This paper proposes a novel neural hashing approach, 'NeuroIndex', which learns compact binary representations of documents and queries. By leveraging the density-aware attention mechanism, NeuroIndex achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets, outperforming traditional indexing methods by up to 3x in query processing speed while maintaining comparable retrieval quality. We also present an efficient online indexing algorithm, enabling NeuroIndex to accommodate large-scale document collections and support real-time querying.
