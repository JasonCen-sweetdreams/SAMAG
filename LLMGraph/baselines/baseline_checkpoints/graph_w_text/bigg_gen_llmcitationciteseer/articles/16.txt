Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing effective interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in VR, focusing on gesture-based interfaces. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, examining how bodily gestures influence cognitive processes and task performance in a virtual environment. Our results show that embodied interfaces can improve spatial awareness, working memory, and overall user experience. We provide design recommendations for incorporating embodied cognition principles into VR interfaces, highlighting the importance of gesture-based interaction in future HCI systems.
