Resource allocation in decentralized systems is a complex problem, particularly in real-time environments. This paper proposes a novel approach using multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize resource allocation in decentralized autonomous systems. We introduce a hierarchical framework, 'MARLA', that leverages decentralized POMDPs and deep reinforcement learning to learn effective allocation strategies. Experimental results on a real-world grid management scenario demonstrate that MARLA outperforms traditional optimization methods, achieving significant improvements in resource utilization and response time.
