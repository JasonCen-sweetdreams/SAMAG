Ad-hoc retrieval techniques often struggle to effectively capture the nuances of user queries, resulting in suboptimal document rankings. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages hierarchical topic modeling to refine query representations. By incorporating topic hierarchies, our approach can better capture the semantic relationships between query terms and document contents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision. We further analyze the impact of topic hierarchy depth on retrieval performance, providing insights into the optimal configuration for different query types.
