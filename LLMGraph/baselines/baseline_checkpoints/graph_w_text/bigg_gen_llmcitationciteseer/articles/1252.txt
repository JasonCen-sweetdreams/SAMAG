This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent task allocation, leveraging deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments in large-scale agent networks. Our proposed framework, 'MARL-Allocator', utilizes a decentralized, actor-critic architecture to learn effective allocation policies that maximize overall system utility. We evaluate MARL-Allocator on a range of simulated scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utilization compared to traditional, heuristic-based allocation methods. Our results have important implications for real-world applications, such as drone swarm coordination and autonomous logistics.
