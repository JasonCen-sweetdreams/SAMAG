Few-shot node classification in graphs is a challenging task, especially when dealing with limited labeled data. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that leverages both node and graph-level attention mechanisms to adapt to new classes. HGAT employs a hierarchical clustering strategy to group similar nodes, enabling effective knowledge transfer from base to novel classes. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot node classification, particularly when faced with scarce labeled data.
