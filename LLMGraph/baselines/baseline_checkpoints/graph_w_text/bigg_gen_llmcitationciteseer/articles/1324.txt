Neural search engines have shown promising results in various information retrieval tasks, but they often struggle with limited query context. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'CTXQE', which leverages contextualized term embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between query terms. By incorporating a transformer-based encoder to model query semantics, CTXQE generates high-quality expansion terms that improve retrieval accuracy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CTXQE outperforms existing query expansion techniques, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
