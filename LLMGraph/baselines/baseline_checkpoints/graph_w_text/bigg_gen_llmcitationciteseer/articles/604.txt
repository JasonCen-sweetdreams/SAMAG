Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their user experience can be compromised by errors, leading to frustration and exclusion. This study investigates the impact of error recovery strategies on user experience and accessibility in voice assistants. We designed and evaluated an inclusive voice assistant prototype that incorporates multimodal feedback, explicit error acknowledgment, and personalized recovery options. Our user study with 40 participants revealed significant improvements in user satisfaction, engagement, and error recovery rates compared to commercial voice assistants. The findings inform the design of more inclusive and supportive voice assistants that cater to diverse user needs.
