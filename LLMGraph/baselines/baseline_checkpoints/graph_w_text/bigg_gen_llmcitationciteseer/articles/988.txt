E-commerce search engines face the challenge of accurately ranking documents for complex, natural language queries. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'Query2Vec', which learns to embed queries into a dense vector space. Our method leverages a multi-task learning framework to jointly optimize query embedding, document ranking, and relevance modeling. Experiments on a large-scale e-commerce dataset demonstrate that Query2Vec outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12% improvement in mean average precision and a 20% reduction in latency. We further analyze the effectiveness of Query2Vec in handling long-tail queries and provide insights into its applicability in real-world e-commerce search engines.
