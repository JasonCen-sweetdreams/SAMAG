In complex systems, autonomous agents often compete for shared resources, leading to inefficiencies and conflicts. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating agent behavior using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We propose a hierarchical framework, 'Agent Harmony', which integrates DRL with graph-based modeling to optimize resource allocation. Our experiments demonstrate that Agent Harmony outperforms traditional rule-based approaches in simulated environments, achieving up to 30% improvement in system-wide efficiency. We also discuss the applicability of our framework to real-world domains, such as smart grids and traffic management.
