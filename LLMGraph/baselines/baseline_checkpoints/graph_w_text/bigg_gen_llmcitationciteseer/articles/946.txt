Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human life, but personalized experiences are crucial to ensure user engagement and satisfaction. This study examines the effects of personalization on user experience in VR environments, focusing on factors such as user modeling, adaptive feedback, and content recommendation. Our user study involving 100 participants reveals that personalized VR experiences lead to increased user satisfaction, reduced cognitive load, and improved task performance. We also identify key challenges and limitations in achieving effective personalization in VR and propose future research directions.
