Distributed graph databases have emerged as a scalable solution for managing large-scale graph-structured data. However, query processing on these systems remains a significant challenge, particularly in the presence of skewed data distributions and varying query workloads. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical replication strategy, 'HierRepl', which dynamically adapts to query patterns and data hotspots. We demonstrate that HierRepl achieves significant improvements in query response times and system throughput compared to traditional replication schemes, while maintaining data consistency and minimizing replication overhead. Experimental results on a real-world social network dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach.
