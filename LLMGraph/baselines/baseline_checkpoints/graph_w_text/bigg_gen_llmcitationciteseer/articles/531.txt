Distributed database systems require efficient data partitioning to minimize communication overhead and ensure scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn data partitioning strategies. We model the database as a graph and utilize GNNs to learn a partitioning scheme that minimizes cut edges while balancing data distribution across nodes. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional data partitioning techniques, achieving up to 30% reduction in communication overhead and 25% improvement in query response time.
