Multi-agent dialogue systems have emerged as a key application of artificial intelligence in human-computer interaction. However, the lack of transparency in these models hinders their widespread adoption. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that enables interpretable dialogue management in multi-agent systems. Our approach consists of two stages: intra-agent attention and inter-agent attention. The former focuses on identifying relevant context within each agent's dialogue history, while the latter captures relationships between agents' responses. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset demonstrate that HAN outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of dialogue coherence and user satisfaction, while providing visualizable attention weights for improved interpretability.
