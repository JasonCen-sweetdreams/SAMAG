Autonomous vehicle swarms require efficient coordination to achieve complex tasks. This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent coordination framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn cooperative policies. Our approach, called 'GNN-Swarm', represents the swarm as a dynamic graph, where each vehicle is a node, and GNNs are used to learn node representations and edge weights. We introduce a novel message-passing scheme that enables vehicles to communicate and adapt to changing swarm configurations. Experiments on a simulated urban environment show that GNN-Swarm outperforms traditional rule-based and centralized approaches in terms of task completion time and collision avoidance.
