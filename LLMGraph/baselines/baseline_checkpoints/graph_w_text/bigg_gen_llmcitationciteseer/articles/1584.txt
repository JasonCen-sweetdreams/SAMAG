This paper presents a novel planning framework for multi-agent systems with temporal constraints. We propose a hierarchical task network (HTN) approach that integrates planning and scheduling to generate optimal plans. Our method exploits the structure of HTNs to efficiently reason about temporal constraints and interactions between agents. Experimental results on a logistics domain demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing planning time and improving plan quality compared to existing methods. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the computational complexity of our algorithm, showing its scalability to large-scale multi-agent systems.
