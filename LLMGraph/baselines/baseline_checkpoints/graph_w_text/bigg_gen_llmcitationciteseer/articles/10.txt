Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning, particularly when dealing with limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) architecture that leverages graph-based attention mechanisms to efficiently learn transferable knowledge from base classes. Our approach hierarchically aggregates feature representations from local to global levels, enabling the model to capture complex relationships between classes. Experimental results on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot learning methods, achieving significant improvements in accuracy and robustness.
