Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach, 'TS_AD', which leverages a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to detect anomalies in multivariate time series data. TS_AD employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant features and time steps, resulting in improved detection accuracy and reduced computational cost. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of TS_AD in detecting anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
