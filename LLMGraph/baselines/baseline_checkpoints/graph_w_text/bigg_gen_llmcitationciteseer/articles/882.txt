Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in information retrieval tasks, but they often struggle with vocabulary mismatch between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep reinforcement learning, which learns to selectively expand queries based on their semantic relevance to the target documents. Our method, NeuralExpansion, utilizes a policy gradient algorithm to optimize the query expansion policy, leveraging a large-scale clickthrough dataset to learn from user behavior. Experimental results on the MSMARCO passage ranking dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art query expansion techniques.
