Virtual reality (VR) has shown promise in stroke rehabilitation, but current systems often rely on simplistic interfaces that neglect the embodied aspects of human experience. This paper presents an embodied interaction design framework for VR-based stroke rehabilitation, focusing on the role of gesture, movement, and haptic feedback in enhancing motor learning and user engagement. We conducted a user study with 20 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in motor function and cognitive load reduction compared to traditional desktop-based systems. Our findings inform the design of more effective, human-centered VR rehabilitation systems that leverage the unique affordances of embodied interaction.
