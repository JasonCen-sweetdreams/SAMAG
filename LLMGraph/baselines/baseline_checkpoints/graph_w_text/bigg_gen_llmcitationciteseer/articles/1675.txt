This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents in dynamic environments. We design a market-based mechanism, called 'AgentMarket', which enables agents to bid for tasks based on their capabilities, preferences, and available resources. AgentMarket uses a combinatorial auction protocol to efficiently allocate tasks to agents, ensuring that the overall system utility is maximized. We evaluate AgentMarket using a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate its effectiveness in adapting to changing environmental conditions and agent availability. The results show that AgentMarket outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and agent satisfaction.
