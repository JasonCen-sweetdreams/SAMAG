As Virtual Reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly accessible, there is a growing need to ensure that VR experiences are inclusive and accessible to diverse user populations. This paper explores the design of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) that can facilitate social interaction and support users with disabilities in VR environments. We present a user-centered design approach that incorporates co-design workshops with users with disabilities, and evaluate the effectiveness of our ECA design in enhancing user experience and social presence in VR. Our findings highlight the importance of considering accessibility and inclusivity in ECA design for VR, and provide insights for the development of more inclusive VR experiences.
