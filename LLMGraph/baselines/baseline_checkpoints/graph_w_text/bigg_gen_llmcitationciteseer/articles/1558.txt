Distributed relational databases are increasingly used to manage large-scale data, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. Traditional optimization techniques rely on heuristics or exhaustive search, which can be ineffective in complex distributed settings. This paper proposes a novel approach that applies reinforcement learning to query optimization. We design a Markov decision process that models the query optimization problem and train an agent to learn optimal query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of execution time, while achieving comparable query accuracy.
