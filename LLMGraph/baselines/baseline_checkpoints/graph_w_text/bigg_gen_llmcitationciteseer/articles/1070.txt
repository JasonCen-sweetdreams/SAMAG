Query expansion (QE) is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) to improve the precision of search results. However, existing QE methods often rely on simplistic term-weighting schemes, ignoring the complex semantic relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'HierExpan', which leverages hierarchical embeddings to capture nuanced term relationships. By integrating HierExpan into a state-of-the-art retrieval system, we demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness on benchmark datasets, outperforming traditional QE methods.
