This paper proposes a novel approach to task allocation in multi-agent systems using deep reinforcement learning. Our method, dubbed 'AgentDRL', leverages a decentralized, communication-avoiding architecture to enable agents to learn optimal task assignments in complex, dynamic environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AgentDRL through extensive simulations on a variety of task allocation problems, showcasing improved solution quality and scalability compared to traditional, centralized optimization techniques.
