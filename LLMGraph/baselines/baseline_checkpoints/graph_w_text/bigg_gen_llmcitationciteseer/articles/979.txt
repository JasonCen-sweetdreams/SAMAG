Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but traditional methods often struggle with heterogeneous information networks (HINs). This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion framework, 'NQE-HIN', which leverages graph neural networks to capture complex relationships between entities in HINs. Our approach generates expanded queries by predicting relevance scores for candidate terms, conditioned on the input query and document context. Experiments on a large-scale HIN dataset demonstrate that NQE-HIN outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision and a 25% reduction in query latency.
