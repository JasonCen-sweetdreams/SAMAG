Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but individuals with visual impairments are often excluded from these experiences. This paper presents an investigation into the design of accessible VR interfaces for visually impaired individuals. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and opportunities, and developed a set of design guidelines and recommendations. Our findings highlight the importance of multimodal feedback, assistive navigation, and personalized customization. We also developed a prototype VR system that incorporates these principles, demonstrating improved usability and accessibility for visually impaired users.
