Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their conversational interfaces often exclude users with speech and language disabilities, such as dysarthria. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop inclusive conversational strategies for voice assistants. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 20 participants with dysarthria, exploring their experiences and preferences when interacting with voice assistants. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive response timing, explicit error handling, and personalized feedback. We propose a set of design guidelines and implement a prototype voice assistant, 'IncluVoice', which demonstrates improved usability and user satisfaction for users with dysarthria.
