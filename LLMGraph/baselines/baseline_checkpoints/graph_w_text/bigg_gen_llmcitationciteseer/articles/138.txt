Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their design often neglects the needs of users with disabilities. This study investigates the impact of cognitive load and emotional experience on the usability of voice assistants for individuals with visual impairments. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, using both quantitative and qualitative measures to assess user experience. Our findings suggest that existing voice assistants can be overwhelming and frustrating, leading to high cognitive load and negative emotional responses. We propose a set of design guidelines for inclusive voice assistants, emphasizing the importance of customizable interfaces, clear feedback, and emotional support.
