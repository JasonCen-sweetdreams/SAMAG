Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in data integration and cleaning, but it becomes increasingly challenging in distributed database systems where data is scattered across multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel graph-based hashing approach, 'HashED', which efficiently disambiguates entities by exploiting their relational structures. HashED utilizes a distributed graph processing framework to construct a scalable indexing mechanism, enabling fast and accurate entity matching. We evaluate HashED on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its ability to outperform state-of-the-art entity disambiguation methods in terms of both accuracy and scalability.
