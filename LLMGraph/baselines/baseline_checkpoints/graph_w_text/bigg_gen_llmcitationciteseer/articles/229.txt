Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults, but existing interfaces are often inaccessible due to cognitive and physical decline. This paper presents a novel VR interface design that leverages gesture recognition to facilitate interaction. We conducted a user study with 20 older adults (ages 65-85) to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional controller-based interfaces. We also present a set of design guidelines for accessible VR interfaces that can be applied to various applications.
