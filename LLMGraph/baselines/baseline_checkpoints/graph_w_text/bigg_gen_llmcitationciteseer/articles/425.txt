Distributed Information Retrieval (DIR) systems are increasingly used in modern search engines to index and query massive datasets. However, the query efficiency of DIR systems is often bottlenecked by the communication overhead between nodes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical index structure, 'HIndex', which reduces query latency by minimizing the number of node interactions. HIndex partitions the index into a hierarchical structure, where each node maintains a summary of its subtree. We evaluate HIndex on a large-scale dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query efficiency, with an average reduction of 37% in query latency compared to existing indexing techniques.
