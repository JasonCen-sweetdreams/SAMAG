Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in query optimization to resolve ambiguity in entity references. This paper proposes a novel graph-based approach, 'GEDB', that leverages the structural properties of relational databases to disambiguate entities. GEDB constructs a graph representation of the database schema and query, and then applies a community detection algorithm to identify densely connected subgraphs that correspond to distinct entities. Our experiments on two real-world databases demonstrate that GEDB outperforms state-of-the-art disambiguation techniques by up to 30% in query optimization efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.
