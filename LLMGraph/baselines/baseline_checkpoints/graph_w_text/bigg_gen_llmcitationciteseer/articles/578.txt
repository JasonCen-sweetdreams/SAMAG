In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that affects the overall performance and efficiency of the system. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework using auctions, where agents bid for tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We introduce a novel bidding strategy, called 'adaptive bid scaling', which adapts to the dynamic environment and ensures that tasks are allocated efficiently. We evaluate our approach using a simulated robotic swarm scenario and demonstrate improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing centralized approaches.
