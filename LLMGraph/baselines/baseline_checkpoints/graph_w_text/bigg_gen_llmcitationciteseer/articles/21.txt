This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, inspired by swarm intelligence principles. We develop a distributed algorithm that utilizes stigmergy-based communication and adaptive pheromone trails to optimize task assignments. Our approach considers agent capabilities, task requirements, and system-wide constraints, enabling efficient and flexible task allocation in dynamic environments. Simulation results demonstrate improved system performance, scalability, and robustness compared to traditional centralized approaches.
