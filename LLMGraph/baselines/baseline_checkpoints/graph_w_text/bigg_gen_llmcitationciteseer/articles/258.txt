Main-memory databases have become increasingly popular due to their ability to process queries at high speeds. However, range queries remain a bottleneck in these systems. This paper presents RAID-Tree, a novel indexing scheme designed to efficiently handle range queries in main-memory databases. Our approach combines a hierarchical tree structure with a novel partitioning strategy, allowing for fast query execution and efficient maintenance. Experimental results demonstrate that RAID-Tree outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques, achieving up to 5x speedup for range queries on real-world datasets.
