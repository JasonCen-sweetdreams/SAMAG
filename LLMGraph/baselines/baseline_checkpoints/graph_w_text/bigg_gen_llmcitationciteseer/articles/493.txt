Multi-tenant database systems face significant challenges in optimizing query performance for diverse workloads. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We propose a Deep Q-Network (DQN) that learns to select optimal query plans based on runtime statistics and system constraints. Our experiments on a commercial multi-tenant database system demonstrate that the RL-based optimizer outperforms traditional rule-based and cost-based optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization, while adapting to changing workload conditions.
