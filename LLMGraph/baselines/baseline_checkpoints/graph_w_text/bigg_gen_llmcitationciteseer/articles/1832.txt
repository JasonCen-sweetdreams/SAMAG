Distributed database systems are increasingly used in modern data-intensive applications, but query performance remains a major bottleneck. This paper presents a novel approach, called AWAP, that adaptively partitions data across nodes based on workload characteristics. AWAP leverages online monitoring and machine learning-based prediction to dynamically adjust data distribution, reducing query latency and improving system throughput. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates up to 40% improvement in query performance compared to static partitioning schemes.
