Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs) comprise diverse node and edge types, making node embedding challenging. We propose a novel Deep Graph Attention Network (DGAT) that leverages attention mechanisms to capture complex node relationships. Our approach adaptively assigns importance scores to neighbors based on their type and proximity, enabling effective node representation learning. Experiments on multiple HIN benchmarks demonstrate that DGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification, clustering, and link prediction tasks.
