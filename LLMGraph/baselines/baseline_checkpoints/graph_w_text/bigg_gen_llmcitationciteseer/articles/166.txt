In complex task allocation problems, decentralized decision-making is crucial for scalability and robustness. We present a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that leverages graph attention mechanisms to learn effective task assignment strategies. Our approach, called GraphAttention-MARL, uses a graph neural network to model agent interactions and incorporates attention weights to focus on relevant neighbors. We evaluate our method in a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion efficiency and adaptability compared to traditional decentralized allocation methods.
