Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been increasingly used in human-computer interaction to facilitate user engagement and understanding. However, their impact on user cognitive load remains understudied. This paper investigates the effectiveness of ECAs in reducing cognitive load in complex tasks. We conducted a user study with 60 participants, comparing a traditional graphical user interface with an ECA-mediated interface. Our results show that the ECA condition resulted in significantly lower cognitive load, as measured by pupillometry and self-reported metrics. We also found that users' perceived workload and task performance improved with the ECA interface. The findings have implications for the design of cognitive-supportive interfaces in various domains, including education and healthcare.
