Explainable recommendation systems have gained popularity in recent years due to their ability to provide transparent and trustworthy suggestions. However, most existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their applicability to large-scale datasets. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that leverages both user and item embeddings to generate accurate and explainable recommendations. We introduce a novel attention mechanism that adaptively selects relevant features at multiple levels of the hierarchy, reducing computational overhead while maintaining performance. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explainability.
