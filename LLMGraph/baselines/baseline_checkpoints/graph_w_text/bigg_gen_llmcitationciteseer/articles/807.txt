Traditional query expansion techniques rely on surface-level term co-occurrences, often failing to capture nuanced semantic relationships. We propose 'SemExp', a novel approach that leverages deep learning to learn dense semantic embeddings of queries and documents. Our method incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively weigh term importance and a graph-based propagation scheme to refine embeddings. Experimental results on a large-scale IR benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for ambiguous and under-specified queries.
