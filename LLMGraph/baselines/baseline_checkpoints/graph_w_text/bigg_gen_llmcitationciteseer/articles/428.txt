Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, 'QERL', which learns to expand queries by optimizing the expected retrieval performance. Our method leverages a hierarchical neural network to represent queries and documents, and a reinforcement learning framework to select the most informative expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QERL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving substantial improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
