Autonomous traffic control systems aim to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. This paper presents a novel approach to coordinating multi-agent systems using reinforcement learning for autonomous traffic control. We propose a decentralized framework, 'MA-RLATC', which enables agents to learn cooperative policies for traffic signal control. Our approach integrates graph-based attention mechanisms to model spatial relationships between agents and incorporates real-world traffic data to improve policy generalizability. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate that MA-RLATC outperforms traditional traffic signal control methods in reducing travel times and increasing network throughput.
