In complex systems, multiple agents often compete for shared resources, necessitating effective negotiation strategies to ensure efficiency and fairness. This paper presents a novel adaptive negotiation framework, 'ANREA', which integrates machine learning and game-theoretic concepts to optimize resource allocation in dynamic environments. ANREA enables agents to learn from experience, adapt to changing context, and negotiate with each other to achieve Pareto-optimal outcomes. Experimental results in a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate that ANREA outperforms traditional auction-based approaches in terms of resource utilization, fairness, and robustness to uncertainty.
