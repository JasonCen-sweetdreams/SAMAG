Information visualization is crucial for decision-making, but traditional interfaces can be cumbersome and slow. We introduce EyeGazeLens, a novel gaze-driven interface that leverages eye-tracking technology to enable users to efficiently explore and interact with visualizations. Our approach uses machine learning to predict the user's gaze patterns and adaptively adjust the visualization to minimize visual clutter and maximize information discovery. Evaluation results show that EyeGazeLens reduces interaction time by 35% and improves user satisfaction compared to traditional mouse-based interfaces.
