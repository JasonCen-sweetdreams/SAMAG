This paper explores the design of voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults. We conducted a user study to investigate the effectiveness of persona-based conversational interfaces in enhancing user experience and accessibility. Our results show that older adults prefer interfaces that incorporate personalized personas, leading to increased engagement and reduced cognitive load. We propose a set of design guidelines for developing inclusive voice assistants, emphasizing the importance of empathy, simplicity, and customization. Our work contributes to the development of more accessible and user-friendly conversational AI systems.
