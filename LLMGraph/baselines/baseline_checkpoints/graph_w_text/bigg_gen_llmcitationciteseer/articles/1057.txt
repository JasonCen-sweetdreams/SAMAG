In complex multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. Existing approaches often rely on centralized optimization or iterative negotiation, which can be computationally expensive and prone to communication overhead. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAT) architecture that learns to allocate tasks in a decentralized, parallelized manner. HAT leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agent capabilities, task requirements, and environmental context. Experimental evaluations on a range of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that HAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of allocation efficiency, adaptability, and scalability.
