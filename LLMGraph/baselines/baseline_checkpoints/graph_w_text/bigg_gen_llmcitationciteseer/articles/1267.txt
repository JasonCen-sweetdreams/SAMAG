Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but users with dysarthria, a speech disorder affecting articulation and pronunciation, often struggle to interact with these systems. This paper presents a novel approach to design inclusive voice assistants that can better understand and respond to users with dysarthria. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to gather speech patterns and develop a customized acoustic model that improves recognition accuracy by 35%. We also designed an adaptive dialogue system that adjusts its response time and feedback based on the user's speech characteristics. Our results show that the proposed approach significantly enhances the user experience and interaction success rate for individuals with dysarthria.
