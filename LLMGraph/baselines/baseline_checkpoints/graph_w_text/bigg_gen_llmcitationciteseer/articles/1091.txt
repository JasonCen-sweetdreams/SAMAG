Ad-hoc retrieval often relies on query expansion to improve retrieval effectiveness. Traditional query expansion methods are limited by their inability to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms. We propose a novel approach, 'DeepCE', which leverages deep learning-based contextual embeddings to model query context. DeepCE learns to encode query terms and their dependencies using a graph-based neural network, enabling more effective query expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepCE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving improvements of up to 15% in mean average precision.
