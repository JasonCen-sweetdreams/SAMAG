This study explores the role of haptic feedback in alleviating cognitive load in virtual reality (VR)-based learning environments. We conducted a user study with 40 participants, who completed a series of tasks in a VR-based educational platform with and without haptic feedback. Our results show that haptic feedback significantly reduces cognitive load, as measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and self-reported metrics. Furthermore, we found that haptic feedback improves learning outcomes, particularly for complex tasks. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based educational systems, highlighting the importance of incorporating haptic feedback to enhance user experience and learning effectiveness.
