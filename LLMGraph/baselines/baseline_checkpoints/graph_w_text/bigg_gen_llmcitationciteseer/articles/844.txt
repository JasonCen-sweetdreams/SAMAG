Node classification in attributed networks is a fundamental task in many applications, including social network analysis and recommender systems. However, existing methods often fail to effectively capture the complex relationships between node attributes and structural properties. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention (HGA) framework, which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant attributes and neighbors at multiple scales. We demonstrate the efficacy of HGA on several benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to noisy attributes.
