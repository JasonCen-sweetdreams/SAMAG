This paper investigates the role of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR)-based learning environments. We designed an VR-based educational platform that incorporates gestures and body movements to enhance learning outcomes. Our user study with 120 participants shows that embodied cognition significantly improves knowledge retention and recall in STEM education compared to traditional desktop-based learning. We also analyzed the impact of individual differences in spatial cognition and motor skills on the effectiveness of embodied cognition in VR-based learning.
