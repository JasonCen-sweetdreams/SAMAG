Ad-hoc retrieval is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to rank documents according to their relevance to a user's query. A crucial component of effective retrieval is estimating the importance of each query term. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'QTI-Net', which leverages deep neural networks to learn query term importance from a large corpus of labeled data. QTI-Net consists of a term encoder, a query encoder, and a relevance predictor, which are jointly trained to optimize retrieval performance. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QTI-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including those based on traditional term weighting schemes and learning-to-rank models.
