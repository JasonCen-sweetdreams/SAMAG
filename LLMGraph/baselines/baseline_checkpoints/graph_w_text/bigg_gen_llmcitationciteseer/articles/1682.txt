Query expansion is a crucial technique in ad-hoc retrieval for improving the retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages the semantic representation capabilities of deep neural networks. NeuroQE uses a multi-task learning framework to jointly learn query and document representations, enabling the model to capture complex contextual relationships between query terms and relevant documents. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall.
