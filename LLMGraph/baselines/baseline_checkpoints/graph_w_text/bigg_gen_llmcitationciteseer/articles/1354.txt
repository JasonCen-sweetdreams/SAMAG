The increasing demand for real-time business intelligence has led to the development of data warehousing systems that can support low-latency queries. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework for column-store indexed data warehouses, which leverages statistical correlations and frequency-based indexing to reduce query execution times. Our approach, called 'CorIdx', incorporates a cost-based optimizer that dynamically selects the most efficient indexing strategy based on query workload and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that CorIdx outperforms traditional row-store indexing by up to 3x in terms of query response time, making it a promising solution for real-time data analytics.
