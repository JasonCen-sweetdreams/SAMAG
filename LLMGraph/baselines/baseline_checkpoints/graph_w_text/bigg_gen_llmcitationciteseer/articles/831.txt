Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their effectiveness is compromised for individuals with age-related hearing loss (ARHL). This study investigates the impact of ARHL on speech recognition accuracy in voice assistants, highlighting the need for inclusive design. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, aged 65-85, to analyze the effects of ARHL on speech patterns and recognition accuracy. Our results show that ARHL significantly affects recognition accuracy, particularly for older adults with severe hearing loss. We propose a novel framework for designing voice assistants that accommodate ARHL, incorporating acoustic models tailored to age-related hearing characteristics and multimodal input support.
