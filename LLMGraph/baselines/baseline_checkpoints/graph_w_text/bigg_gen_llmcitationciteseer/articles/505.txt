Existing neural ranking models for document retrieval often require substantial computational resources, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking framework, 'HiRank', which leverages a two-stage ranking architecture to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. The first stage employs a lightweight neural network to filter out irrelevant documents, while the second stage utilizes a more computationally expensive neural model to refine the ranking. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HiRank achieves comparable ranking performance to state-of-the-art models while reducing computational costs by up to 60%.
