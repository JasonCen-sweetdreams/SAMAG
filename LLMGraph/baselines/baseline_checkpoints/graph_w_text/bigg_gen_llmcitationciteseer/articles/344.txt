Ad-hoc search queries often suffer from vocabulary mismatch, leading to poor retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select expansion terms. Our method, 'RL-QE', uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy for adding or removing terms based on their expected impact on retrieval quality. Experimental results on the TREC dataset show that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and NDCG@10.
