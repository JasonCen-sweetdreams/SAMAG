Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but accurate intention recognition remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach, 'GazeIntention', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to recognize user intentions from gaze patterns in VR environments. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that considers both short-term and long-term gaze behaviors to infer user intentions. Our experiments on a large-scale VR dataset demonstrate that GazeIntention outperforms state-of-the-art intention recognition methods by 15% in terms of accuracy and 20% in terms of latency.
