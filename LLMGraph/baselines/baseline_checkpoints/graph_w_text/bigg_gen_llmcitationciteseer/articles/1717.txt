State-of-the-art neural ranking models for document retrieval often sacrifice diversity for relevance. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DiversiRank', which incorporates a diversity-promoting regularizer into the ranking loss function. We reformulate the ranking problem as a heterogeneous graph learning task, allowing our model to capture both document relevance and semantic similarity. Experimental results on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that DiversiRank outperforms existing methods in terms of both relevance and diversity metrics, while maintaining efficient query response times.
