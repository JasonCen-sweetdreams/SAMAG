Cloud computing platforms face the challenge of efficiently allocating resources to dynamic workloads. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, 'AdaptAlloc', which learns to adapt resource allocation policies based on real-time workload patterns and system performance metrics. We develop a novel state-action representation that captures the complex relationships between workload characteristics, resource utilization, and system performance. Experimental results on a large-scale cloud simulation platform show that AdaptAlloc outperforms traditional rule-based and model-driven approaches in terms of resource utilization, response time, and energy efficiency.
