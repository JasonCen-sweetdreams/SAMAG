Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their conversational interfaces often pose barriers for users with disabilities. This paper presents a user study investigating the accessibility of popular voice assistants, highlighting issues with speech recognition, cognitive load, and feedback mechanisms. We propose a set of design guidelines for more inclusive conversational interfaces, including adaptable dialogue structures, multimodal feedback, and personalized error handling. Our findings inform the development of more accessible voice assistants, promoting equal access to information and services for all users.
