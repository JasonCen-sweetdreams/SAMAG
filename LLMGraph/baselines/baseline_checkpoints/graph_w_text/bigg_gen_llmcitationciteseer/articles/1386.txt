With the increasing prevalence of distributed database systems, optimizing queries across heterogeneous data sources has become a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'HDSOptimizer', which leverages a combination of machine learning and graph-based techniques to efficiently optimize queries across diverse data sources. We propose a novel cost model that captures the nuances of heterogeneity in data sources and develop a genetic algorithm-based approach to search for the optimal query plan. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that HDSOptimizer reduces query execution times by up to 40% compared to existing optimization techniques.
