Neural search has emerged as a promising approach for information retrieval, but its effectiveness relies heavily on the quality of query representations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method, 'RL-QE', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize the selection of expansion terms. We formulate the expansion process as a Markov decision process and train an RL agent to select terms that maximize the expected retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
