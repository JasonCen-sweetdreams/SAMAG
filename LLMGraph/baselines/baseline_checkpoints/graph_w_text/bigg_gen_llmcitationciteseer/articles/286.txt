Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on outdated thesauri or cumbersome manual tuning. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using word embeddings, which capture subtle semantic relationships between terms. We introduce 'EmbedExpan', a framework that leverages a new type of word embedding, 'semantically-aware' embeddings, to generate high-quality expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EmbedExpan outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval effectiveness, while reducing computational overhead.
