Virtual reality (VR) has revolutionized human-computer interaction, but accurate gesture recognition remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of multimodal feedback in improving gesture recognition in VR-based systems. We designed an experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of visual, auditory, and haptic feedback in reducing gesture recognition errors. Our results show that multimodal feedback significantly improves gesture recognition accuracy, particularly for complex gestures. We also found that users' preference for feedback modality varies depending on the type of gesture and individual differences. Our findings have implications for the design of VR-based gesture recognition systems that prioritize user experience and accuracy.
