Neural retrieval models have shown promising results in ad-hoc information retrieval, but their performance can be limited by the quality of the initial query representation. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroExp', which leverages the semantic relationships learned by a neural network to generate high-quality expansion terms. We demonstrate that NeuroExp outperforms traditional query expansion methods, such as RM3 and Relevance Models, in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that NeuroExp can improve the performance of neural retrieval models by up to 15% in terms of mean average precision.
