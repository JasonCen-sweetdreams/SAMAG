Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel deep neural network-based approach to query expansion, which leverages the strengths of both word embeddings and semantic matching models. Our proposed method, 'NeuroQE', learns to generate context-aware expanded queries that better capture the underlying semantics of the original query. Experimental results on the TREC-8 ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, particularly for short and ambiguous queries, compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
