Open-domain question answering (ODQA) has seen significant advancements with the advent of dense passage retrieval (DPR) models. However, these models often rely on computationally expensive similarity scoring mechanisms, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes ProxIR, a novel proximity-based document retrieval framework that leverages geometric relationships between passage embeddings to efficiently identify relevant documents. We introduce a hierarchical clustering approach that prunes the search space and reduces the number of similarity computations required. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that ProxIR achieves comparable retrieval performance to state-of-the-art DPR models while reducing computational costs by up to 60%.
