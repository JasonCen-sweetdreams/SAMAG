Efficient indexing of high-dimensional data is crucial for various applications, including similarity search, clustering, and nearest neighbor retrieval. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'HiGrid', which leverages hierarchical grids to partition the data space. By recursively applying a combination of space-filling curves and k-d trees, HiGrid achieves a logarithmic query time complexity and reduces the index size by up to 50% compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of HiGrid for high-dimensional data indexing and querying.
