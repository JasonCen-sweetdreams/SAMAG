Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular for large-scale data storage and processing. However, query performance remains a significant bottleneck due to network latency and data transfer overhead. This paper proposes an adaptive caching framework, 'CacheFlex', which dynamically adjusts cache sizes and content based on query patterns and data access frequencies. We evaluate CacheFlex on a realistic workload derived from the TPC-DS benchmark and demonstrate significant improvements in query response times and throughput. Our results show that CacheFlex achieves up to 3x speedup compared to traditional caching strategies, making it a promising solution for high-performance distributed database systems.
