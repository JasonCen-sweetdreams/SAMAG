Voice assistants have become increasingly prevalent, but their usability for older adults remains a concern. This study investigates the impact of speech recognition accuracy and cognitive load on the user experience of older adults interacting with voice assistants. Our user study with 30 participants aged 65-85 reveals that older adults face significant difficulties with current voice assistants, attributed to speech recognition errors and high cognitive load. We propose a novel design framework, 'EASE', which incorporates age-related considerations, such as slower speech rates and augmented feedback. Our results show that EASE significantly improves user satisfaction, task completion rates, and reduces cognitive load for older adults.
