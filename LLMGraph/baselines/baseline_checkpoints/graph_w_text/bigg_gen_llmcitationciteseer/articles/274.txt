Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing query execution plans in such systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to optimize query plans based on the feedback from the database. Our approach leverages the exploration-exploitation trade-off to balance the optimization of query plans. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
