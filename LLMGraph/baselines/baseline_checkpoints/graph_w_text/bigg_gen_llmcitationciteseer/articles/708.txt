Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is a crucial task in various applications, including IoT and finance. Existing methods often struggle with the curse of dimensionality and fail to capture complex patterns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering-based approach, 'HierAD', which leverages a tree-like structure to identify anomalies at multiple scales. By recursively applying density-based clustering and dimensionality reduction, HierAD effectively detects anomalies in high-dimensional space while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HierAD over state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and efficiency.
