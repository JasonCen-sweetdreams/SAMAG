This paper proposes a novel approach to document ranking for information retrieval using hierarchical neural networks. Our model, HierRank, leverages the strengths of both neural ranking models and traditional retrieval methods. We introduce a hierarchical architecture that combines semantic and syntactic features from multiple levels of document representation, allowing for more accurate and efficient ranking. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models and traditional retrieval methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness and computational efficiency.
