Passage retrieval has become a crucial component in many natural language processing applications. However, the ranking of passages often relies on simple lexical matching methods, which can lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a neural re-ranking approach that incorporates document expansion to capture contextual information. Our model, ExpandoRank, utilizes a hierarchical encoder to represent passages and their surrounding documents, and then applies a neural ranking function to re-score the passages. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that ExpandoRank achieves significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art passage retrieval models.
