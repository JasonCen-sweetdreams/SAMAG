In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a decentralized approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks to heterogeneous agents. Our method, 'DAGAT', learns to represent agents and tasks as nodes in a graph and employs a self-attention mechanism to capture complex dependencies between them. We show that DAGAT outperforms traditional optimization-based methods in terms of solution quality and scalability, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a simulation study of a disaster response scenario.
