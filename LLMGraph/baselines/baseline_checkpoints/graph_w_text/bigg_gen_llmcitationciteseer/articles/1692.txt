The surge in real-time data analytics has rendered traditional query optimization techniques insufficient. This paper presents 'QLearn', a novel framework that leverages learned index structures to accelerate query optimization. By integrating a neural network-based index with a traditional query optimizer, QLearn reduces query latency by up to 70% on real-world datasets. We introduce a novel indexing technique, 'Hist-Index', which adapts to dynamic data distributions and efficiently handles range queries. Experimental results on a popular data analytics benchmark demonstrate QLearn's ability to scale to large datasets while maintaining high performance.
