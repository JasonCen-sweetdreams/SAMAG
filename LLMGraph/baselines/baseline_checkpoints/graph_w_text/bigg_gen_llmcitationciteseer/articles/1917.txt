Distributed document-oriented databases (DDODs) are increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale semi-structured data. However, query optimization in DDODs remains a challenging task due to the complexity of document schema and the distributed nature of the system. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'DQO', which leverages a combination of machine learning-based cost modeling and graph-based query rewriting to minimize query latency and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world DDOD system demonstrate that DQO achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to existing optimization techniques.
