As the global elderly population grows, there is a pressing need for inclusive assistive technologies that can accommodate cognitive and motor impairments. This paper presents a novel gesture recognition system, 'Easy Gesture', which adapts to the abilities and preferences of individual elderly users. Our approach integrates machine learning with participatory design, involving iterative user studies and co-design workshops with elderly participants. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Easy Gesture in a longitudinal study, showing significant improvements in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional one-size-fits-all approaches.
