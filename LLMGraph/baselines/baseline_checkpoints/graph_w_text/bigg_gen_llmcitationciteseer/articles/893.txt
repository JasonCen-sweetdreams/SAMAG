This paper explores the concept of embodied cognition in virtual reality (VR) environments, focusing on the role of gestural interfaces in enhancing user experience. We designed a VR system that incorporates hand-tracking technology and machine learning-based gesture recognition, enabling users to interact with virtual objects in a more natural and intuitive way. Our user study reveals that the embodied cognition approach improves user engagement, reduces cognitive load, and increases overall satisfaction. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the design of future VR systems and their potential applications in fields such as education, training, and therapy.
