Voice assistants have the potential to improve the independence and quality of life for older adults with cognitive impairments. However, current systems often fail to account for the unique needs and challenges of this population. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to creating inclusive voice assistants, incorporating insights from a series of co-design workshops with older adults and caregivers. We identify key barriers to adoption, including difficulties with speech recognition, conversation flow, and error recovery, and propose design recommendations to address these issues. Our evaluation with 20 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction.
