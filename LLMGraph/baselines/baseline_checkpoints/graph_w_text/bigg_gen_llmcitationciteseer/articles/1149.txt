Indexing high-dimensional data is a crucial task in many applications, including similarity search and nearest-neighbor retrieval. Traditional indexing methods often suffer from the curse of dimensionality, leading to poor performance and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel approach, dubbed 'LHash', which leverages learned hash functions to efficiently index high-dimensional data. We demonstrate that LHash can significantly outperform state-of-the-art indexing methods, such as locality-sensitive hashing and ball trees, in terms of query efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on several real-world datasets show that LHash achieves a 3-5x speedup over traditional methods while maintaining high retrieval accuracy.
