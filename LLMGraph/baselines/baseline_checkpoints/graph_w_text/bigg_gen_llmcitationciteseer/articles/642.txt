Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to query expansion, dubbed 'RL-QE'. RL-QE models the query expansion process as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to select relevant terms to add to the original query. Our experiments on several TREC datasets demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
