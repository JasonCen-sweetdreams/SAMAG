Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of life, but individuals with motor impairments often face barriers in interacting with VR systems. This paper presents a novel, inclusive VR interface design framework that accommodates users with motor impairments. We conducted a participatory design study with participants having varying levels of motor impairments and developed a set of accessible interaction techniques, including gesture-based navigation and eye-gaze-based selection. Our user study demonstrates that the proposed interface significantly improves user experience and task performance for participants with motor impairments, paving the way for more inclusive VR applications.
