Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval for improving the retrieval performance of short text documents. However, existing methods often suffer from the problem of semantic drift, where the expanded queries deviate from the original query intent. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages word embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between words. Our approach uses a graph-based algorithm to select the most relevant expansion terms, which are then weighted using a probabilistic framework. Experimental results on several short text datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of retrieval accuracy and robustness.
