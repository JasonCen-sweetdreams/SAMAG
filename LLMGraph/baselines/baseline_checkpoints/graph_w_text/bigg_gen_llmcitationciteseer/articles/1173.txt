Real-time data warehousing demands efficient query processing to support timely business decisions. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, called Column-Store Adaptive Indexing (CSAI), which leverages column-store storage and adaptive indexing to optimize query performance. CSAI dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns and data distribution, resulting in significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that CSAI outperforms traditional row-store and column-store indexing approaches by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage efficiency.
