Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a question. Recent advances in graph-based neural networks have shown promising results in ODQA, but are computationally expensive. This paper proposes a hierarchical graph neural network (HGNN) that learns to represent passages as graphs and performs efficient retrieval using a pruning mechanism. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Natural Questions dataset while reducing inference time by 30%. We also provide an analysis of the learned graph structures, which reveals insights into the reasoning process of ODQA models.
