Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but current systems often lack a sense of embodiment, leading to user discomfort and disorientation. This paper presents an investigation into the role of embodiment in VR, exploring the impact of proprioceptive feedback, body awareness, and self-representation on user experience. We develop and evaluate a novel VR system that incorporates real-time tracking of the user's body, providing a more immersive and engaging experience. Our findings suggest that embodiment significantly enhances user satisfaction, reduces cybersickness, and improves task performance in VR environments.
