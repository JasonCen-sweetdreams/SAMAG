Ad-hoc search query expansion is a crucial technique for improving retrieval effectiveness. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages neural word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms. Our method, called 'NWEE', uses a graph-based framework to integrate word embeddings with traditional query expansion techniques. Experimental results on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate that NWEE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain. We also analyze the impact of different word embedding models on retrieval performance.
