Coordinating multi-agent systems in complex, dynamic environments is a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel decentralized approach using partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) to model and coordinate agent behavior. We develop a scalable, distributed algorithm that enables agents to share and integrate local observations, reducing the dimensionality of the joint state space. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate improved coordination and reduced communication overhead compared to centralized POMDP approaches.
