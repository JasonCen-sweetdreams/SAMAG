In distributed systems, autonomous agents can optimize resource allocation by adapting to dynamic environmental conditions. However, coordination among agents remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a decentralized coordination framework, 'DynaCoord', which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize resource allocation in real-time. DynaCoord integrates a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group agents based on their resource requirements, enabling efficient communication and decision-making. Simulation results on a realistic cloud computing scenario demonstrate that DynaCoord outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods, achieving up to 35% improvement in system throughput and 25% reduction in resource waste.
