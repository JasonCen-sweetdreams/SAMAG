Neural search has shown promising results in various information retrieval tasks, but it often struggles with query formulation. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages pseudo-relevance feedback to improve the retrieval performance of neural search models. Our method, dubbed 'NeuroXPand', generates a set of expansion terms by analyzing the neural representations of top-ranked documents. We evaluate NeuroXPand on several TREC benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques. Our approach is computationally efficient and can be easily integrated into existing neural search pipelines.
