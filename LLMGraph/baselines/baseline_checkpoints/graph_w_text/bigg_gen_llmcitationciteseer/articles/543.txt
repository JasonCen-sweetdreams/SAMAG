Conversational agents have become increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of individuals with dyslexia. This paper presents a human-centered approach to designing accessible conversational agents that cater to users with dyslexia. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and opportunities for improvement. Our findings inform the development of 'DyslexiaChat', a novel conversational agent that incorporates multimodal input, speech-to-text functionality, and personalized learning pathways. A pilot evaluation with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates compared to existing conversational agents.
