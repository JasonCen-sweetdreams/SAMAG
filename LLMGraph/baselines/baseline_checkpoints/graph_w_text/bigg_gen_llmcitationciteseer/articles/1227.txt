This paper explores the application of embodied cognition theory in virtual reality (VR) to enhance learning outcomes in educational settings. We designed a gesture-based interaction system that leverages the cognitive benefits of bodily engagement to improve knowledge retention and recall. Our user study with 120 participants revealed significant improvements in learning outcomes for users who employed gestures to manipulate virtual objects, compared to those using traditional keyboard-and-mouse interfaces. We also found that embodied interaction increased user engagement and motivation, leading to a more immersive and effective learning experience.
