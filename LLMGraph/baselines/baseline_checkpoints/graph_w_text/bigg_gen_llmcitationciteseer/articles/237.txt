Real-time analytics on distributed graph databases poses significant query optimization challenges. Existing approaches either sacrifice query performance or incur high overheads for maintaining graph consistency. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'GraphPulse', which leverages graph summarization and adaptive sampling to reduce query latency by up to 75%. GraphPulse utilizes a probabilistic graph model to estimate query results and dynamically adjusts sampling rates based on query complexity and graph topology. Experimental evaluations on large-scale graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphPulse in supporting real-time analytics workloads.
