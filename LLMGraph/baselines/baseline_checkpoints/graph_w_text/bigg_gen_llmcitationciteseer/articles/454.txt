Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) enables fast analytics on rapidly changing data, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents AQOR, an adaptive query optimizer that leverages machine learning to predict query performance and select optimal execution plans. AQOR incorporates a novel query embedding technique that captures semantic and syntactic features of queries, allowing it to generalize well to unseen queries. Experimental results on a real-world RTDW system show that AQOR reduces average query latency by 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimizers, while adapting to changing workload and data distributions.
