As augmented reality (AR) systems become increasingly ubiquitous, ensuring secure user authentication is crucial. We propose a novel gaze-based authentication approach, 'GazeAuth', which leverages deep learning to classify users based on their gaze patterns. Our method uses a convolutional neural network to extract features from eye-tracking data and a recurrent neural network to model the temporal dependencies of gaze movements. Experimental results on a dataset of 50 users show that GazeAuth achieves an accuracy of 97.5% and an equal error rate of 2.1%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on a commercial AR headset.
