Deep neural networks in autonomous vehicles are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can lead to catastrophic consequences. This paper presents a novel adversarial training approach, 'AdvDet', that improves the robustness of object detection models against physical-world attacks. We propose a hybrid method combining virtual and real-world adversarial examples, and introduce a novel loss function that balances detection accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that AdvDet outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial training methods, achieving a 25% reduction in detection errors under attack.
