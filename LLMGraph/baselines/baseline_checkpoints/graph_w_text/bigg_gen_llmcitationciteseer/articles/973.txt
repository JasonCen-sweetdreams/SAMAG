This paper presents a novel approach to document retrieval, integrating hierarchical neural ranking with query expansion. Our proposed model, HierQR, employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture multi-level semantic relationships between query terms and document contents. Additionally, we incorporate a query expansion module that adaptively selects and weights expansion terms based on their relevance to the original query. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierQR achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art neural ranking models. Furthermore, our approach reduces the computational overhead associated with traditional query expansion techniques.
