Distributed column-stores have become increasingly popular for big data analytics. However, optimizing query execution plans for such systems remains a complex problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query plans. Our framework, 'ColumnRL', uses a deep Q-network to learn an efficient exploration-exploitation strategy for query optimization. We evaluate ColumnRL on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques.
