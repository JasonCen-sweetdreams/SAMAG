As Virtual Reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, it is essential to ensure that VR experiences are accessible and enjoyable for users with diverse abilities. This paper presents a novel adaptive gesture recognition system that can be integrated into VR applications to improve the user experience for individuals with motor impairments. Our system utilizes machine learning algorithms to dynamically adjust gesture recognition thresholds based on a user's performance and preferences. We conducted a user study with 20 participants and found that our system significantly reduced error rates and improved user satisfaction compared to traditional gesture recognition systems.
