This paper presents a novel approach to designing gesture recognition systems that adapt to the cognitive and motor abilities of older adults with cognitive impairments. We propose a machine learning-based framework that integrates insights from cognitive psychology and HCI principles to provide personalized gesture recognition models. Our approach leverages a multi-modal sensor setup and a participatory design methodology to co-design the system with older adults. The results of our user study demonstrate improved gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction compared to traditional one-size-fits-all approaches.
