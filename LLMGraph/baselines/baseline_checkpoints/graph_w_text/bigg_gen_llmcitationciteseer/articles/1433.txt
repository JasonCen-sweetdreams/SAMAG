Temporal graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying dynamic network data. However, existing query processing techniques are often inefficient, leading to poor performance and high latency. This paper proposes a novel time-series indexing approach, 'ChronoIndex', which leverages the inherent temporal locality in graph data to accelerate query execution. We introduce a compact index structure that captures both spatial and temporal relationships, enabling efficient processing of complex queries involving time-based predicates. Experimental results on large-scale temporal graph datasets demonstrate that ChronoIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 5x in query response time.
