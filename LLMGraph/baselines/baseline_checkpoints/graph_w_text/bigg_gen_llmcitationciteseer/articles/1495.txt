Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However,query performance remains a major bottleneck. This paper proposes an adaptive query routing (AQR) framework that dynamically adjusts query routing decisions based on real-time system metrics, such as node utilization and network latency. We present a novel cost model that incorporates query complexity, data locality, and system load, enabling the AQR framework to optimize query execution. Experimental results on a real-world DDS deployment demonstrate significant improvements in query response times and system throughput.
