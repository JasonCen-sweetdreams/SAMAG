Gesture-based authentication systems have gained popularity in recent years, but they often rely on visual and auditory cues, which can be compromised by shoulder-surfing attacks or auditory eavesdropping. This paper explores the use of vibrotactile feedback as an additional authentication factor. We designed a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of vibrotactile feedback in improving the security and usability of gesture-based authentication systems. Our results show that the use of vibrotactile feedback can significantly reduce error rates and improve user satisfaction, while also providing a higher level of security against shoulder-surfing attacks.
