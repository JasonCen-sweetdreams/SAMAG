Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in many applications, including finance, healthcare, and energy management. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that leverages multi-resolution inputs to improve forecasting accuracy. Our HAN model consists of multiple attention layers that learn to focus on relevant temporal resolutions, capturing both short-term and long-term dependencies. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, including prophet and LSTM-based models. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability analysis of the attention weights, revealing insightful patterns in the data.
