Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, but existing methods often suffer from high computational costs and limited performance gains. This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural query expansion approach, which leverages the strengths of both traditional term-based expansion and deep learning-based semantic matching. Our method uses a multi-level attention mechanism to selectively incorporate relevant terms and concepts from the query context, leading to significant improvements in document retrieval performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in retrieving relevant documents, especially for complex, multi-faceted queries.
