In multi-agent systems, task allocation and deconfliction are critical to ensure efficient and safe operation. This paper addresses the problem of dynamic task allocation in the presence of conflicting constraints. We propose a novel deconfliction strategy based on graph theory and model predictive control, which can adapt to changing task priorities and agent capabilities. Our approach is evaluated through simulations of a search-and-rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced conflicts compared to existing methods. Theoretical bounds on the complexity and scalability of our approach are also provided.
