Distributed database systems require efficient data replication strategies to ensure consistency, availability, and fault tolerance. This paper presents a novel replication scheme, 'AdaptiveRep', which dynamically adjusts the replication factor based on workload characteristics and network conditions. We propose a cost-benefit model that considers factors such as data freshness, query latency, and storage overhead. Experimental results on a simulated distributed database show that AdaptiveRep outperforms existing static replication strategies in terms of overall system performance and resource utilization.
