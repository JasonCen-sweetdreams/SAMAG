Decentralized multi-agent planning is a challenging problem, particularly when agents have incomplete information about the environment. This paper proposes a novel approach using hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to facilitate information sharing and coordination among agents. Our method, called Dec-HGNN, consists of a hierarchical architecture that integrates local observation models with a global planning module. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Dec-HGNN in a variety of scenarios, including robotic search and rescue, and resource allocation in smart grids. Experimental results show that Dec-HGNN outperforms existing decentralized planning methods, even with incomplete information.
