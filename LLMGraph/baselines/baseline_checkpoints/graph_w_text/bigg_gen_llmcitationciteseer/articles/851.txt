Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their usability for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice interface, 'EASE', tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults with cognitive impairments, revealing key challenges and design recommendations. EASE incorporates features such as simplified language, visual cues, and personalized feedback, resulting in improved task completion rates and user satisfaction. Our findings have implications for the development of more accessible and supportive voice-based systems for vulnerable populations.
