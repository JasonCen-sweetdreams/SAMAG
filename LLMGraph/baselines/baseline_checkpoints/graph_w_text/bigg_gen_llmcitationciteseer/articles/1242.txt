Real-time data warehousing requires efficient view maintenance to ensure timely analytics and reporting. This paper presents 'Riva', a novel incremental view maintenance approach that leverages a hybrid data structure combining in-memory caching and disk-based storage. Riva adaptively adjusts its maintenance strategy based on the arrival rate of new data and available system resources, achieving a 3x speedup over existing incremental view maintenance techniques. We evaluate Riva on a real-world IoT dataset and demonstrate its scalability and performance in supporting real-time analytics workloads.
