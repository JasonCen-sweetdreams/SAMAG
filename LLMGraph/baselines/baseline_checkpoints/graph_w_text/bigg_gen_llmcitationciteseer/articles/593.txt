Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents often struggle with exploration-exploitation trade-offs and sample inefficiency. This paper introduces a novel experience replay mechanism, Hindsight Experience Replay (HER), which leverages hindsight knowledge to augment the agent's experience. By relabeling past experiences with the final outcome, HER enables the agent to learn from failed attempts and generalize to unseen situations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HER in various Atari games and a real-world robotic manipulation task, showcasing improved robustness and adaptability in complex, dynamic environments.
