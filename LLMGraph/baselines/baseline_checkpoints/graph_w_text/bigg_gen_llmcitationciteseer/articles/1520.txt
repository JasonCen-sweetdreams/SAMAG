Medical information retrieval (MIR) systems often struggle to effectively capture the nuances of medical terminology, leading to suboptimal search results. We propose a novel query expansion approach that leverages hierarchical graph convolutional networks (H-GCNs) to model the semantic relationships between medical concepts. Our method, MedExpand, represents medical terms as nodes in a hierarchical graph, allowing the model to capture both local and global contextual information. Experimental results on the TREC Medical Retrieval dataset demonstrate that MedExpand outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision (MAP) and normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG)
