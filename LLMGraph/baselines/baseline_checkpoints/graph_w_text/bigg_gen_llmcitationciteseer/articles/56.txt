Distributed relational database systems (DRDBS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, query optimization in DRDBS remains a challenging task due to the complexity of optimizing queries across multiple nodes. This paper proposes a novel query optimization algorithm, 'DROPS', which leverages a combination of machine learning and graph-based methods to efficiently optimize queries in DRDBS. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DROPS outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in query execution time.
