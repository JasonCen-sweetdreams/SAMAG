Autonomous agents are increasingly employed in various negotiation domains, necessitating effective strategies for bilateral negotiations. This paper presents a novel framework for multi-issue bilateral negotiations, where agents negotiate over multiple interdependent issues. We propose a hybrid approach combining concession-based and learning-based strategies, incorporating insights from behavioral economics. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of negotiation outcome quality, negotiation time, and opponent satisfaction.
