In decentralized multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that requires efficient and adaptive solutions. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to allocate tasks in heterogeneous agent teams. Our method, called 'GraphTask', represents the agent team as a graph and leverages GNNs to learn task assignments based on agent capabilities, task requirements, and communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GraphTask in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario, showing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional optimization-based methods.
