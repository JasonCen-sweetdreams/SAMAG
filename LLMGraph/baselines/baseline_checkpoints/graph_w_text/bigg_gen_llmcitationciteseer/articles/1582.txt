Dense passage retrieval (DPR) has become a popular paradigm for open-domain question answering, but its computational requirements can be prohibitive for large-scale datasets. This paper introduces a novel query-adaptive document embedding (QA-DE) method that learns to dynamically adjust document representations based on the input query. Our approach leverages a lightweight query-document interaction module to compute context-aware document embeddings, reducing the need for exhaustive similarity computations. Experimental results on the Natural Questions and TriviaQA datasets demonstrate that QA-DE achieves comparable retrieval accuracy to state-of-the-art DPR methods while reducing inference time by up to 3.5x.
