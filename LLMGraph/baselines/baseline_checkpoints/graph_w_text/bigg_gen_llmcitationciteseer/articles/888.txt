In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper presents a novel approach to distributed task allocation using reinforcement learning. We model the task allocation problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that enables agents to learn effective allocation policies. Our approach leverages a graph neural network to encode agent-agent and agent-task relationships, facilitating scalable and flexible task allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional heuristic-based approaches in various task allocation scenarios.
