Distributed search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from a massive index. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, dubbed 'HQE', which leverages semantic clustering and term weighting to reduce the search space. HQE iteratively refines the query by incorporating context-aware expansion terms, resulting in improved precision and recall. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HQE outperforms existing query expansion methods, reducing query latency by up to 40% while maintaining comparable retrieval quality.
