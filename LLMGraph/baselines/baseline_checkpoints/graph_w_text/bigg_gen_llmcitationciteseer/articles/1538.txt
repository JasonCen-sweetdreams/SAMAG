We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for real-time traffic signal control. Our approach, dubbed 'SMART', enables agents to adapt to changing traffic patterns and optimize traffic flow in real-time. By integrating graph neural networks and attention mechanisms, SMART agents can effectively communicate and coordinate with each other, reducing congestion and minimizing travel times. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate that SMART outperforms traditional rule-based and centralized optimization methods, achieving an average reduction of 25% in travel time and 30% in congestion.
