Anomaly detection in attributed networks is a crucial task with applications in cybersecurity, finance, and social media analysis. This paper proposes a novel deep learning framework, 'VG-AE', which leverages the power of graph autoencoders and variational inference to identify anomalies in attributed networks. VG-AE models the underlying graph structure and attribute distributions jointly, enabling it to capture complex patterns and relationships between nodes. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VG-AE in detecting anomalies, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
