Query expansion is a crucial component of ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the gap between the user's query and the relevant documents. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages neural embeddings to reinforce query expansion. Our method, dubbed 'NeuQE', uses a neural network to learn semantic representations of query terms and expands them using a reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that NeuQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving an average improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision.
