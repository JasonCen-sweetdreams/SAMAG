The role of query intent in information retrieval systems has garnered significant attention in recent years. This study investigates the effects of query intent on document retrieval performance in modern search engines. We propose a novel intent-aware retrieval framework, which incorporates a deep learning-based intent detection module to classify queries into informational, navigational, or transactional categories. Experimental results on a large-scale query log dataset demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in precision, recall, and user satisfaction compared to traditional retrieval methods that ignore query intent.
