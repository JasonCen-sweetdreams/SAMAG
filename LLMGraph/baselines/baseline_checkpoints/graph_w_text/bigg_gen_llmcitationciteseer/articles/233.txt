Graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing complex relationships between data entities. However, query optimization for distributed graph databases remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed graph databases. We propose a Deep Q-Network (DQN) based framework that learns to predict the optimal query plan based on the graph structure, query patterns, and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query latency and 25% in terms of resource utilization.
