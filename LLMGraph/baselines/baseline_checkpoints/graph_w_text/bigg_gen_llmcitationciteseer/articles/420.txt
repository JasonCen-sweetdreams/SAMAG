Ad-hoc information retrieval systems often struggle to effectively capture the nuanced semantic relationships between query terms and relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural embeddings to encode query terms and documents in a shared vector space. Our method, 'NeuroXPand', uses a graph-based neural network to model the relationships between query terms and expand the query with relevant synonyms and related concepts. Experiments on several standard TREC datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for queries with ambiguous or rare terms, compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
