Node classification in large-scale graphs is a fundamental problem in many domains. While Graph Attention Networks (GATs) have shown promising results, they suffer from scalability issues due to the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. This paper proposes Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGATs), a novel architecture that leverages hierarchical graph representations to reduce the attention complexity. We develop a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group nodes into clusters, and apply GATs within each cluster. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGATs achieve state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational costs by up to 70%
