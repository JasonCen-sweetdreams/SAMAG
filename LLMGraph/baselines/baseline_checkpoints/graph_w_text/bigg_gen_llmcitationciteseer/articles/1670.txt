Traditional query optimization techniques are often inadequate for real-time analytics in column-oriented database systems, where query patterns and data distributions are dynamic and unpredictable. This paper presents 'Aurora', a novel adaptive query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and statistical models to predict query performance and adjust optimization strategies in real-time. Our experiments on a popular column-store database show that Aurora reduces average query latency by up to 3.5x and improves query throughput by up to 2.2x compared to state-of-the-art static optimization techniques.
