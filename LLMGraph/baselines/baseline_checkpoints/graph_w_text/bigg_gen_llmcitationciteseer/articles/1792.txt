Main-memory databases have revolutionized query processing by minimizing disk I/O. However, traditional indexing techniques are often suboptimal in this context. This paper proposes a novel learned index structure, 'MemIndex', that leverages machine learning models to predict the memory location of query results. We develop a data-driven approach to index construction, exploiting the compactness of main-memory data to reduce index size and improve query performance. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that MemIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query throughput and 2x in memory efficiency.
