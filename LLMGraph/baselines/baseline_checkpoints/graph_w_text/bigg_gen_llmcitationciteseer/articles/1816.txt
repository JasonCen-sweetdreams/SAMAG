Distributed query processing is crucial for large-scale data analytics, but optimizing join order enumeration remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively explore the vast space of possible join orders. Our method, called 'JoinRL', utilizes a Markov decision process to model the query optimization problem and learns to make informed decisions about join order enumeration. Experimental results on a range of distributed query workloads demonstrate that JoinRL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers, reducing query execution times by up to 30%.
