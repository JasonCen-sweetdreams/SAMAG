Explainable recommendation systems (ERS) have gained popularity in recent years due to the need for transparency in AI-driven decision-making. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) that incorporates both item-level and user-level graph attention mechanisms to learn complex relationships between users and items. HGAT generates personalized explanations for top-N recommended items, improving user trust and satisfaction. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art ERS methods in terms of recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
