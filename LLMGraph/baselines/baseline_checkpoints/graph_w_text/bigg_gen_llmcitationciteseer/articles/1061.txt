Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it significantly impacts the performance and scalability of complex data analytics workloads. This paper presents DeepQOpt, a novel query optimization framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to efficiently explore the vast space of possible query plans. We design a customized DRL agent that learns to navigate the query optimization landscape, leveraging domain-specific knowledge and feedback from the database system. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database benchmark demonstrate that DeepQOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving up to 3x speedup and 2x improvement in resource utilization.
