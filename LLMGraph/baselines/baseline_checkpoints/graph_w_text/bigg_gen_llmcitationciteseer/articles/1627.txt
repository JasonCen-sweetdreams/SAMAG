Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their effectiveness is often hindered by limitations in speech recognition, particularly for accented speech. This paper investigates the impact of accented speech on voice assistant interactions for older adults, a demographic that is increasingly reliant on these systems. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, employing a mixed-methods approach to analyze the effects of accent, age, and cognitive load on speech recognition accuracy. Our findings highlight the need for inclusive design principles in voice assistant development, and we propose a set of guidelines for improving accented speech recognition in these systems.
