The proliferation of fake news on social media has severe consequences for individuals, businesses, and society as a whole. Existing detection methods rely on handcrafted features or deep learning models that lack interpretability. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) that integrates multiple modalities (text, images, and user metadata) to detect fake news. Our HAN architecture consists of modality-specific attention modules that learn to weigh the importance of each modality and a hierarchical fusion module that combines the modality-specific representations. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale dataset and demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and explainability.
