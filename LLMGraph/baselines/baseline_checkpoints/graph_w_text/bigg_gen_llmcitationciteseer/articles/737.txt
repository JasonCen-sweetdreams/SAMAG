Mobile health applications have become increasingly popular for promoting healthy behavior. This study investigates the effectiveness of gamification in encouraging users to adopt healthy habits through mobile apps. We designed and developed a mobile app that incorporated gamification elements, such as points, badges, and leaderboards, to motivate users to engage in physical activity and healthy eating. Our results show that gamification significantly increased user engagement and retention, resulting in improved physical activity levels and healthier dietary choices. However, we also found that the effectiveness of gamification varied depending on individual differences in motivation and personality traits.
