Virtual Reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize education by providing immersive and interactive learning experiences. However, the effectiveness of VR-based learning environments can be influenced by various factors, including personalization. This study explores the impact of personalized VR experiences on user experience, engagement, and learning outcomes. We designed and evaluated a VR-based learning platform that incorporates user modeling and adaptive content presentation. Our results show that personalized VR experiences lead to increased user satisfaction, engagement, and knowledge retention compared to non-personalized experiences. The findings of this study have implications for the design of VR-based learning environments and highlight the importance of considering personalization in HCI research.
