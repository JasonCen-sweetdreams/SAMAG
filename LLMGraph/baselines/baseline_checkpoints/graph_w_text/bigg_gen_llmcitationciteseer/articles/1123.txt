State-of-the-art information retrieval systems rely on dense neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between documents. However, indexing these embeddings for efficient querying remains a significant challenge, particularly for large-scale collections. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural embedding framework, 'HierIndex', which leverages a tree-based indexing structure to facilitate fast and accurate document retrieval. We demonstrate that HierIndex outperforms existing indexing methods in terms of query latency and memory usage, while maintaining retrieval effectiveness on several benchmark datasets.
