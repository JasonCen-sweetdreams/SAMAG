Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between the user's query and relevant documents. This paper presents a neural approach to query expansion, leveraging semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between terms. We propose a novel architecture, 'NeuroXpand', which jointly learns to predict expansion terms and their weights based on the query context. Experimental results on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that NeuroXpand outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and robustness.
