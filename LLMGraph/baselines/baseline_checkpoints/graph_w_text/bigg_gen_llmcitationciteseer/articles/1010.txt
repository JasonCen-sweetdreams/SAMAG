In distributed multi-agent systems, planning and decision-making require coordinating actions among agents to achieve a common goal. This paper presents a decentralized planning framework that leverages distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to solve the planning problem. We propose a novel DCOP algorithm that enables agents to communicate and negotiate with each other to find a feasible plan, while respecting local constraints and minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results on a logistics scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms centralized planning methods in terms of solution quality and scalability.
