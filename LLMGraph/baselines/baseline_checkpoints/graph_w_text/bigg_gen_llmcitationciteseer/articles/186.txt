Autonomous vehicle platooning can significantly improve road safety and efficiency. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for adaptive coalition formation among autonomous vehicles. Our algorithm, 'AdaptPlato', enables vehicles to dynamically form and reform platoons based on their speed, position, and communication range. We demonstrate that AdaptPlato outperforms existing platooning strategies in terms of fuel efficiency, travel time, and accident rate reduction. Experimental results using SUMO simulations show that our approach can adapt to varying traffic conditions and vehicle mixes.
