Traditional document retrieval methods rely on keyword-based matching, which often fails to capture the semantic relationships between queries and documents. This paper proposes a novel neural query graph generation framework, 'NQG', which represents queries as graph structures to better model their compositional semantics. Our approach leverages a graph neural network to encode the query graph and a dense passage retriever to rank documents based on their relevance to the query graph. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that NQG outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
