Multi-tenancy has become a prevalent deployment model for cloud-based database systems, where multiple tenants share the same database instance. However, query optimization in such systems remains a significant challenge due to the varying workload patterns and resource constraints of each tenant. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MTQO', which leverages machine learning-based predictive modeling to anticipate workload patterns and dynamically adjust query optimization strategies. We evaluate MTQO on a real-world multi-tenant database system and demonstrate significant improvements in query performance and resource utilization compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
