Gamified learning systems have shown promise in enhancing user engagement and learning outcomes. However, a key challenge lies in adapting the game difficulty to individual learners' skills and preferences. This paper presents 'EyeLearn', a novel approach that leverages eye-tracking data to infer learners' cognitive states and adjust game difficulty in real-time. Our approach utilizes machine learning models to analyze eye movement patterns and correlate them with learner performance. We evaluate EyeLearn in a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating significant improvements in learning outcomes and user satisfaction compared to traditional difficulty adjustment methods.
