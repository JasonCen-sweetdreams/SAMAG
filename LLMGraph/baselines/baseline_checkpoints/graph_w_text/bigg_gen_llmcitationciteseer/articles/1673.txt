Ad-hoc search systems often struggle to retrieve relevant documents when the query lacks context or contains ambiguous terms. This paper proposes a novel query-driven document expansion approach that leverages both local and global context to improve retrieval effectiveness. Our method, 'QDE', first identifies the most informative terms in the query and then expands the document representation by incorporating related concepts from a knowledge graph. We evaluate QDE on several standard ad-hoc search datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods.
