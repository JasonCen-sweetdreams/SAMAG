Ad-hoc retrieval, a fundamental task in information retrieval, aims to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Query expansion, a popular technique to improve retrieval performance, involves adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'BERT-SE', which leverages BERT-based semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between terms. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques on several TREC benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating contextualized semantic representations in ad-hoc retrieval.
