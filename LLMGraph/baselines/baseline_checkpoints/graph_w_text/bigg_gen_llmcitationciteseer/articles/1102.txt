Graph-based recommendation systems have shown promising performance in capturing complex relationships between users and items. However, the lack of transparency in these models hinders their adoption in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates graph attention and self-attention mechanisms to provide explanations for the recommended items. Our approach, called GraphExplain, leverages the graph structure to identify key users and items that influence the recommendation process. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphExplain not only improves recommendation accuracy but also provides meaningful explanations for the recommended items, enhancing the trustworthiness of the system.
