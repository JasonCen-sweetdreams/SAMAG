Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval that aims to improve the retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method that leverages deep neural word embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between words. Our approach uses a pre-trained language model to generate context-aware word representations, which are then used to select expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional query expansion techniques and achieves state-of-the-art performance in ad-hoc retrieval tasks.
