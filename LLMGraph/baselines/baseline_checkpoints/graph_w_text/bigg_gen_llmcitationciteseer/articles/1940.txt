Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their ability to provide emotional support and personalized experiences remains limited. This study explores the effects of emotional feedback and personalization on user experience in chatbots. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants, using a novel chatbot prototype that incorporates emotional intelligence and personalization features. Results show that personalized chatbots with emotional feedback mechanisms lead to increased user satisfaction, trust, and self-disclosure. Our findings inform the design of more inclusive and empathetic conversational interfaces, highlighting the importance of emotional intelligence in human-chatbot interactions.
