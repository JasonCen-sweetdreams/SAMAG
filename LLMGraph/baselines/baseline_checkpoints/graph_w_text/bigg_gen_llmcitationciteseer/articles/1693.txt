 Passage retrieval is a critical component of open-domain question answering systems. While neural re-ranking models have improved retrieval accuracy, they can be computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages neural re-ranking models to generate effective query expansions. Our method, dubbed 'NeuQE', uses a learned re-ranker to identify the most relevant passages for expansion, and then incorporates these expansions into a sparse retrieval model. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset show that NeuQE improves retrieval accuracy by 3.5% compared to state-of-the-art sparse retrieval models, while reducing computational overhead by 40%.
