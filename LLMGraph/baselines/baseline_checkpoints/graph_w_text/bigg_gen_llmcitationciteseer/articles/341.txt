As graph databases continue to grow in scale, query optimization becomes a critical bottleneck. Existing techniques struggle to handle the complexity of distributed graph queries, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper presents a novel approach, 'DynaGO', which leverages machine learning to predict query execution plans for distributed graph databases. DynaGO uses a graph neural network to learn a probabilistic model of query execution costs and adapts to changing data distributions. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that DynaGO achieves up to 3x improvement in query performance compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
