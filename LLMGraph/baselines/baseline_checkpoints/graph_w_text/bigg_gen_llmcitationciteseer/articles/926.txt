Short text retrieval remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of relevant keywords. Query expansion techniques have been widely used to address this issue, but they often rely on manual feature engineering and suffer from high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network-based approach for query expansion, dubbed 'DeepQE'. DeepQE leverages the capabilities of transformer-based architectures to learn contextualized representations of query terms and documents. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show that DeepQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision.
