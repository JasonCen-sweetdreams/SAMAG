Public displays are increasingly prevalent in urban spaces, but existing authentication methods are often cumbersome or vulnerable to shoulder-surfing attacks. We present EyeGazeAuth, a novel gaze-driven authentication system that leverages users' eye movements to securely authenticate them. Our approach utilizes a deep learning-based gaze estimation model, which is trained on a large dataset of eye movement patterns. We evaluate EyeGazeAuth on a public display prototype and demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately verifying users while maintaining a high level of security and usability.
