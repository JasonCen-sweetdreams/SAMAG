Intelligent assistive systems have the potential to revolutionize the lives of individuals with disabilities. However, user engagement and adoption rates remain a significant concern. This paper explores the role of gamification in enhancing user experience and motivation with intelligent assistive systems. We designed and implemented a gamified interface for a speech-to-text system and conducted a user study with 30 participants. Results show that gamification significantly improved user engagement, with participants exhibiting increased usage and self-reported satisfaction. We also identified key design factors that influence the efficacy of gamification in this context.
