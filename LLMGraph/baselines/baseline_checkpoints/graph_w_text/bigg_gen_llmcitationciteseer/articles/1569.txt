Question answering (QA) over knowledge graphs (KGs) has gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing KG embedding methods suffer from scalability issues and neglect the hierarchical structure of KGs. We propose a novel hierarchical attention-based KG embedding model, HAKE, which captures entity relationships at multiple levels of abstraction. HAKE outperforms state-of-the-art models on several benchmark QA datasets, achieving a 12.5% relative improvement in accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HAKE in modeling complex KG structures and its potential applications in QA, recommendation systems, and natural language processing.
