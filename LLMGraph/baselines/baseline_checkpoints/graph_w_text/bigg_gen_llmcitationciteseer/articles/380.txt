Time series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. While deep learning models have shown promising results, their lack of interpretability hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that not only detects anomalies but also provides explanations for its predictions. Our approach leverages a hierarchical self-attention mechanism to identify relevant features and time steps contributing to the anomaly score. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in detecting anomalies while offering meaningful insights into the decision-making process.
