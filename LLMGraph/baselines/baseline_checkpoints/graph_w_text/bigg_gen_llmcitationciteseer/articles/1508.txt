As augmented reality (AR) technology becomes increasingly pervasive, ensuring the security of AR interfaces is crucial. This paper presents a novel gaze-based implicit authentication approach, 'GazeAuth', which leverages the user's gaze patterns to authenticate their identity. We develop a machine learning model that analyzes the user's gaze behavior while interacting with an AR interface, achieving an accuracy of 95.2% in distinguishing between genuine and imposter users. Our approach offers a seamless, unobtrusive, and highly secure authentication mechanism for AR applications.
