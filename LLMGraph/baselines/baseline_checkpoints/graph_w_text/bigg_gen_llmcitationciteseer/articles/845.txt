As the global population ages, there is a growing need for accessible and user-friendly interfaces that cater to older adults. Voice-based interfaces have shown promise in reducing cognitive load, but their design must be tailored to accommodate age-related cognitive declines. This study conducted a series of user experiments to investigate the effects of voice-based interface design on cognitive load reduction in older adults. Our results indicate that incorporating age-specific design features, such as simplified language and feedback mechanisms, can significantly reduce cognitive load and improve user experience. We provide guidelines for designers to create more inclusive and accessible voice-based interfaces for older adults.
