The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms has severe consequences for individuals and society. This paper presents a novel explainable graph neural network (GNN) framework, 'FakeGNN', for detecting fake news articles. FakeGNN incorporates node-level attention mechanisms to identify crucial entities and relationships in the news article graph, and a graph-based explanation module to provide interpretable insights into the detection process. Experimental results on a large-scale fake news dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of FakeGNN in detecting fake news articles with high accuracy and providing transparent explanations.
