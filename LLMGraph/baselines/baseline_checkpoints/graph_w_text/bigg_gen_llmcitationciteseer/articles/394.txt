This paper introduces Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT) to address the challenges of multi-agent reinforcement learning in complex, dynamic environments. By incorporating graph attention mechanisms into a hierarchical framework, HGAT enables agents to selectively focus on relevant neighboring agents and learn effective communication strategies. We evaluate HGAT on a range of multi-agent benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance and scalability compared to existing methods. Our approach has significant implications for real-world applications, such as autonomous traffic management and robotic teams.
