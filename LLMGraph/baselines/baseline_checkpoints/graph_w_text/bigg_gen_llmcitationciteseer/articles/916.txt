Urban traffic management requires efficient coordination of heterogeneous agents, including traffic lights, surveillance cameras, and vehicles. This paper presents a novel multi-agent system, 'TrafficCoordinator', which dynamically allocates tasks to agents based on real-time traffic patterns and agent capabilities. We propose a hybrid approach combining auction-based task allocation with a graph-based conflict resolution mechanism to minimize traffic congestion and reduce travel times. Experiments on a simulated urban traffic network demonstrate that TrafficCoordinator outperforms existing decentralized approaches, achieving a 23% reduction in average travel time and a 15% decrease in congestion.
