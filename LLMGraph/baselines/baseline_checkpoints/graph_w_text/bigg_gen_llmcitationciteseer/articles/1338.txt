Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents for answer extraction. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical dense retrieval (HDR) approach that leverages a two-stage retrieval strategy to reduce the search space. We first use a coarse-grained retriever to identify top-ranked documents and then apply a fine-grained retriever to identify relevant passages within those documents. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDR achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods, while also reducing computational costs.
