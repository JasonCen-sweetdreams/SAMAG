Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in various natural language processing and information retrieval applications. However, existing approaches suffer from scalability issues when dealing with large knowledge graphs and dictionaries. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'GEDIS', which leverages graph neural networks to learn entity representations and dictionary-based indexing to efficiently prune the search space. Our experiments on the Wikidata dataset demonstrate that GEDIS achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing the average query time by an order of magnitude compared to existing methods.
