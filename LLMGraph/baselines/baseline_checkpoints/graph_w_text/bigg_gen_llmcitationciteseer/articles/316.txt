Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it directly affects the quality of retrieved documents. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion by leveraging neural embeddings to model sentence semantics. Our proposed method, 'NeuQE', uses a transformer-based architecture to learn contextualized embeddings of query terms and expands the query with semantically similar terms. Experimental results on the TREC datasets demonstrate that NeuQE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, particularly in scenarios with limited query context, and improves the overall retrieval performance by 12% in terms of mean average precision.
