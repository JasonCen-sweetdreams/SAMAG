This paper addresses the task allocation problem in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities and resources need to coordinate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a decentralized approach based on distributed constraint optimization, which enables agents to locally solve sub-problems and iteratively refine their solutions. Our method, called DCO-TA, leverages asynchronous communication and partial observability to scale to large systems. Experimental results on a realistic disaster response scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of DCO-TA in achieving near-optimal task allocations while adapting to dynamic environment changes.
