Ad-hoc search systems struggle to balance retrieval efficiency with query understanding. We propose a neural query expansion approach, 'NeuQE', which learns to generate context-aware query refinements from a few relevant documents. NeuQE combines a BERT-based query encoder with a graph attention network to capture document relationships and generate cohesive expansions. Our experiments on the TREC-8 and Robust04 benchmarks demonstrate that NeuQE improves retrieval effectiveness by up to 15% while reducing query latency by 30% compared to state-of-the-art methods.
