Time-series anomaly detection is a crucial task in various applications, but most existing methods lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAT) that detects anomalies while providing explainable insights into the decision-making process. HAT leverages a hierarchical structure to model complex temporal dependencies and attention mechanisms to identify relevant features. We evaluate HAT on three benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superior detection performance and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
