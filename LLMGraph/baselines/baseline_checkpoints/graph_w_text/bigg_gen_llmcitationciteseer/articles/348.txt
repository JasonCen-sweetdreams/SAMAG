In this paper, we propose a decentralized autonomous agent-based resource allocation framework for multi-agent systems. Our approach leverages game-theoretic mechanisms to facilitate coordination among agents, ensuring efficient allocation of shared resources. We introduce a novel algorithm, 'AgentRA', which utilizes iterative auctions and adaptive learning to optimize resource utilization. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate that AgentRA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of fairness, efficiency, and scalability.
