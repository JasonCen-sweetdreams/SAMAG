Cooperative multi-agent systems require efficient planning and coordination to achieve complex tasks. This paper presents a novel hierarchical task network (HTN) planning framework for cooperative multi-agent systems. Our approach leverages a hierarchical decomposition of tasks into subtrees, enabling agents to reason about both local and global objectives. We introduce a distributed planning algorithm that enables agents to negotiate and adapt their plans in response to changing environmental conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach in a variety of cooperative task scenarios, including robotic search and rescue and autonomous vehicle coordination.
