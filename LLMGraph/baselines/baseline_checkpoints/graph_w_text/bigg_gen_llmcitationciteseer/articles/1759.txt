As multi-agent systems become increasingly prevalent, the need for transparent decision-making processes grows. This paper introduces HAN-MAD, a hierarchical attention network architecture that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent environments. HAN-MAD leverages attention mechanisms to identify relevant agent interactions and contextual information, generating interpretable explanations for joint decisions. We evaluate HAN-MAD on a range of multi-agent tasks, demonstrating improved decision-making performance and enhanced explainability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
