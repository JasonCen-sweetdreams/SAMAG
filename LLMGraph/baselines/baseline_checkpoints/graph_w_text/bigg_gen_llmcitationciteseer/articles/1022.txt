Coordinating multi-agent systems to achieve complex tasks is a challenging problem in artificial intelligence. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates adaptive task allocation with reinforcement learning to optimize agent coordination. Our approach, called 'ATA-RL', uses a decentralized task allocation algorithm to assign tasks to agents based on their capabilities and availability. The agents then learn to adjust their actions using reinforcement learning, taking into account the tasks assigned to them and the actions of other agents. We evaluate ATA-RL in a simulated search and rescue scenario, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to existing approaches.
