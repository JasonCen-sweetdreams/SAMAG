Entity disambiguation (ED) is a crucial task in knowledge graph construction, but existing approaches suffer from poor scalability and high latency. This paper proposes a novel indexing framework, 'RT-Index', designed for real-time ED in large-scale knowledge graphs. RT-Index leverages a combination of graph partitioning, entity embedding, and hierarchical indexing to enable efficient querying and disambiguation. Experimental evaluations on the YAGO and DBpedia datasets demonstrate that RT-Index improves query response times by up to 5x and achieves competitive disambiguation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
