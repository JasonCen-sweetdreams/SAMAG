Autonomous systems, such as self-driving cars or drones, require efficient multi-agent planning to execute complex tasks. This paper presents a novel hierarchical task network (HTN) approach for scalable multi-agent planning, where agents decompose high-level tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks. We introduce a distributed planning algorithm that leverages a hierarchical representation of tasks to reduce communication overhead and improve planning efficiency. Experimental results on a multi-drone surveillance scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing decentralized planning methods, achieving a 3x speedup in planning time while maintaining equivalent solution quality.
