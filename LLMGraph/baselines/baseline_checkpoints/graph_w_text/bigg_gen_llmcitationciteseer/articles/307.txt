Time-series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains, but the lack of interpretability in existing models limits their adoption. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAN) that leverages the structural relationships between time series to improve forecasting accuracy and interpretability. Our approach learns to extract relevant features from local and global graph structures, enabling the model to focus on the most informative temporal dependencies. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAN in capturing complex patterns and providing interpretable insights into the forecasting process.
