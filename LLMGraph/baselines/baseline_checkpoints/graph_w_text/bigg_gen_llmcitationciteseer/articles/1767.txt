Neural search has gained popularity due to its ability to capture semantic relationships in queries and documents. However, the effectiveness of neural search models relies heavily on the quality of query embeddings. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages context-aware embeddings to refine query representations. By incorporating contextual information from the query, CAQE improves the retrieval performance of neural search models. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall.
