Distributed database systems have become ubiquitous in modern data management, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel approach to query optimization using approximation algorithms, which leverage the structure of the underlying data distribution to reduce the search space. We propose two new algorithms, 'DistOpt' and 'ApproxJoin', which achieve near-optimal query plans with provable bounds on approximation error. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers in terms of execution time and plan quality.
