Voice-assisted technologies have become increasingly prevalent, but their usability and accessibility for older adults remain a concern. This study investigates the design of inclusive conversational interfaces for this demographic. We conducted user studies and surveys to identify key challenges and preferences of older adults when interacting with voice-assisted systems. Our findings inform the development of a novel interface framework that incorporates age-related considerations, such as speech recognition accommodations and cognitively accessible dialogue flows. A usability evaluation of our prototype with older adults demonstrates improved task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing commercial systems.
