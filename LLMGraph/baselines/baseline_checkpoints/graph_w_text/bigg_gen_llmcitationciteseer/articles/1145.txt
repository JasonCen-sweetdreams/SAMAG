Explainable recommendation systems are crucial for building trust with users. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Graph Convolutional Network (HAGCN) architecture that integrates both item-level and user-level explanations. HAGCN employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture complex relationships between users and items, and leverages graph convolutional networks to model high-order interactions. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HAGCN outperforms state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models in terms of accuracy and informativeness of explanations.
