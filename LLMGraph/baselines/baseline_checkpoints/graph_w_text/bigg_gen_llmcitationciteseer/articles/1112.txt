The proliferation of IoT devices and social media platforms has led to an exponential increase in data generation, driving the need for real-time analytics in distributed database systems. However, query optimization remains a significant bottleneck in such systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RTOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cost estimation and constraint programming to efficiently optimize queries for real-time analytics. Experimental results on a simulated distributed database system demonstrate that RTOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query response time.
