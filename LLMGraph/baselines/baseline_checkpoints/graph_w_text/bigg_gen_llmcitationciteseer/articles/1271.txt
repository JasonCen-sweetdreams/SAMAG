Conventional neural ranking models for document retrieval suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, 'HiRank', which leverages a coarse-to-fine ranking strategy to reduce the number of documents required for relevance scoring. HiRank employs a two-stage architecture, consisting of a lightweight filter network and a more accurate ranker network, to efficiently identify relevant documents. Our experiments on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate that HiRank achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing the computational cost by up to 75% compared to existing neural ranking models.
