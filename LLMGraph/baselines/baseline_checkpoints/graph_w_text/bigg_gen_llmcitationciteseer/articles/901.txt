This paper proposes a novel approach to causal reasoning in multi-agent systems using probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). We introduce a probabilistic framework that enables agents to reason about the causal relationships between their actions and the environment. Our approach leverages Bayesian networks to model the causal dependencies between agents' actions and the environment, and performs inference using variational Bayesian inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated multi-agent domain, showing improved decision-making and coordination among agents compared to traditional rule-based approaches.
