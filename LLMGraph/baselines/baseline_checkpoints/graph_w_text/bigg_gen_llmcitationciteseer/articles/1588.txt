Coordinating multi-agent systems is a challenging problem, especially when tasks are complex and interdependent. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task decomposition framework, 'HTD-RL', which integrates reinforcement learning to optimize task allocation and execution. HTD-RL represents tasks as a hierarchical graph and uses a distributed Q-network to learn optimal task assignments. We evaluate HTD-RL on a simulated warehouse management scenario, demonstrating improved coordination efficiency and reduced task completion time compared to state-of-the-art methods.
