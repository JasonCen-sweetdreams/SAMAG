This paper presents a novel decentralized multi-agent planning framework that leverages hierarchical task networks (HTNs) to coordinate complex tasks among multiple agents. Our approach, called DeMA-HTN, introduces a distributed HTN representation that enables agents to reason about their local tasks and communicate with neighboring agents to resolve dependencies. We propose a hierarchical planning algorithm that iteratively refines the HTN structure to ensure consistency and optimality. Experimental results on a logistics domain demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of DeMA-HTN in solving large-scale planning problems with improved solution quality and reduced communication overhead.
