Relational reinforcement learning (RRL) has shown promise in complex decision-making tasks, but existing methods lack interpretability. We introduce Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT), a novel architecture that integrates graph attention mechanisms with hierarchical reinforcement learning. HGAT learns to focus on relevant relational structures and abstract away irrelevant information, enabling explainable decision-making. We evaluate HGAT on several RRL benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability compared to state-of-the-art methods.
