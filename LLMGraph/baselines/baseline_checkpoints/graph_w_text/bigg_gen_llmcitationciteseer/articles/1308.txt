The increasing scale of modern information retrieval systems necessitates the development of efficient document retrieval methods. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages hierarchical embeddings to capture the semantic structure of documents. Our method, dubbed 'HierRet', employs a multi-level clustering scheme to reduce the dimensionality of the embedding space, thereby facilitating faster retrieval times. Experimental results on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that HierRet achieves a significant reduction in retrieval latency while maintaining comparable retrieval performance to state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods.
