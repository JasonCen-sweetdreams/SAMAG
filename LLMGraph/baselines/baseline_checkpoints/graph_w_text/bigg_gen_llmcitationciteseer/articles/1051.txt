Open-domain question answering (ODQA) involves retrieving relevant passages from a large corpus to answer a given question. While dense neural retrievers have shown promising results, they can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. This paper proposes a novel sparse representation approach, termed 'SparsePass', which leverages sparse linear algebra to efficiently index and retrieve passages. We demonstrate that SparsePass achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art dense retrievers while reducing memory usage by 90% and inference time by 75%. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset show that SparsePass is particularly effective for longer passages and complex questions.
