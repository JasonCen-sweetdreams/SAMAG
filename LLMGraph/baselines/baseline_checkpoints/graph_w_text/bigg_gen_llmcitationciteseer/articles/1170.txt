Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize the way people interact with digital information, but existing VR interfaces often exclude users with motor impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing accessible VR interfaces that can be controlled using alternative input methods, such as gaze, speech, or electromyography (EMG) signals. We evaluate our approach through a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in interaction time and user satisfaction compared to traditional VR interfaces. Our findings provide insights into the design of inclusive VR experiences that can benefit a broader range of users.
