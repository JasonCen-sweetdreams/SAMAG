This paper addresses the problem of coordinating multi-agent systems in the presence of uncertain beliefs. We propose a novel Bayesian learning approach that enables agents to update their beliefs about the environment and other agents' intentions. Our framework, called BayesCoord, uses a probabilistic graphical model to represent the joint distribution of agent beliefs and incorporates a distributed optimization algorithm to maximize the global utility. We evaluate BayesCoord in a simulated robotic soccer domain and demonstrate improved coordination and decision-making compared to traditional planning-based approaches.
