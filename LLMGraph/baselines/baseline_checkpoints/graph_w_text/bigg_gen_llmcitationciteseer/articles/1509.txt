Individuals with dyslexia often face barriers when interacting with conversational interfaces, such as chatbots and voice assistants. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create more inclusive conversational interfaces for individuals with dyslexia. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving surveys, interviews, and usability testing to identify the needs and preferences of individuals with dyslexia. Our findings inform the design of a novel conversational interface that incorporates assistive features, such as text-to-speech, font customization, and error tolerance. Our evaluation shows that the designed interface improves the interaction experience and reduces errors for individuals with dyslexia, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in HCI.
