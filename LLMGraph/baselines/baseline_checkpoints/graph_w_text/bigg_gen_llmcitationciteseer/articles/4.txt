Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in information retrieval, but existing approaches often struggle with scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) for entity disambiguation. HGAT leverages the hierarchical structure of knowledge graphs to selectively focus on relevant context and entities. We propose a new attention mechanism that adaptively weights entity relationships based on their relevance to the query. Experimental results on the Wikidata dataset demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of disambiguation accuracy and computational efficiency.
