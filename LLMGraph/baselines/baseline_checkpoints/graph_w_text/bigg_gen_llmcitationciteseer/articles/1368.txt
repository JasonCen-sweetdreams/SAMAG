This paper presents a novel neural re-ranking approach for efficient information retrieval, leveraging query-adaptive document ranking to improve the effectiveness of traditional retrieval models. Our proposed architecture, QADR, incorporates a neural re-ranker that adaptively weighs document features based on the query context, thereby enhancing the ranking accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QADR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing the computational overhead by up to 30%.
