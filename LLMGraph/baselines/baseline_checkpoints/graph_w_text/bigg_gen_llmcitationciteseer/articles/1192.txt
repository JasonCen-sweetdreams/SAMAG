Multi-tenant database systems are increasingly popular in cloud-based services, but optimizing query performance in such environments remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). We design a DRL agent that learns to select optimal query plans based on a reward function that considers both performance and fairness metrics. Our experimental results on a real-world benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization, while ensuring fairness across tenants.
