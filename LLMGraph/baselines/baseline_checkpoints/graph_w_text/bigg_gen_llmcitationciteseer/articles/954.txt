Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with complex queries. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'QRG-Rank', which leverages reinforced learning to optimize document ranking. We introduce neural query graphs to capture semantic relationships between query entities and documents, and employ a policy gradient method to learn the optimal ranking policy. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that QRG-Rank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
