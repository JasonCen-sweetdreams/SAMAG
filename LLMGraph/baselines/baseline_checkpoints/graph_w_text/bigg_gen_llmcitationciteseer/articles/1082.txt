Multi-agent systems often rely on complex decision-making processes that are difficult to interpret. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAN) framework that enables explainable decision-making in multi-agent settings. HGAN leverages graph attention mechanisms to model agent interactions and hierarchical structures to capture abstract decision-making processes. We evaluate HGAN on a variety of multi-agent benchmarks, demonstrating improved performance and interpretability compared to existing approaches. Additionally, we provide visualizations and feature importance analysis to illustrate the explanatory capabilities of HGAN.
