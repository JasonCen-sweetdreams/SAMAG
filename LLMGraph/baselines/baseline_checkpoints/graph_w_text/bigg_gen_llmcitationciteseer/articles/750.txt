Neural sentence embeddings have shown promise in natural language processing tasks, but their application to document ranking remains limited. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'QRank', which leverages query-aware neural sentence embeddings to improve the effectiveness of document ranking. QRank learns to capture the semantic relationships between query sentences and document sentences, enabling more accurate ranking of relevant documents. Our experiments on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that QRank outperforms state-of-the-art document ranking models, particularly for complex queries.
