Semantic search has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its ability to capture the nuances of user queries. However, existing methods often struggle with query expansion, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. We propose a novel approach that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to generate context-aware query expansions. Our method, called KG-Expan, uses a graph attention mechanism to selectively incorporate entity relationships and semantic types into the expansion process. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that KG-Expan outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
