In multi-agent systems, ensuring timely commitment to actions is crucial for achieving global goals. This paper presents a decentralized timed commitment protocol, 'ChronoCommit', which enables agents to make reliable commitments while respecting real-time constraints. We introduce a novel distributed clock synchronization mechanism that adapts to network delays and agent heterogeneity. Our protocol ensures that agents commit to actions within a bounded time interval, thereby preventing unnecessary rollbacks and improving system efficiency. Experimental evaluations on a simulated smart grid scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of ChronoCommit in reducing commitment latency and increasing system resilience.
