Ad-hoc information retrieval (IR) systems often struggle to accurately capture user intent, leading to suboptimal query representations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic relationships between query terms and documents. Our method, called 'NeuroQE', integrates a bidirectional transformer encoder with a weighted term importance estimation module to generate more effective query expansions. Experimental results on several standard IR benchmarks demonstrate that NeuroQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval accuracy and robustness.
