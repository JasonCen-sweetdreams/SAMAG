Ad-hoc search queries often suffer from vocabulary mismatch, leading to poor retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel hierarchical query expansion approach, 'HQE', which leverages a combination of lexical, semantic, and contextual cues to enhance query representation. HQE first identifies key terms and their relationships using a graph-based method, then iteratively expands the query through a hierarchical clustering process. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that HQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score, while maintaining efficiency and scalability.
