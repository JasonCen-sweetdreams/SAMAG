The proliferation of IoT devices has led to an explosion in time-series data, which poses significant challenges for real-time aggregation and querying. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'TS-Tree', designed specifically for IoT time-series databases. TS-Tree leverages a hierarchical, prefix-compressed structure to minimize storage overhead while enabling fast aggregation and range queries. We evaluate TS-Tree on a large-scale IoT dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing methods.
