Coalition formation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents need to form coalitions to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a novel adaptive coalition formation framework using reinforcement learning. Our approach, called Adaptive Coalition Formation Algorithm (ACFA), uses Q-learning to learn the optimal coalition formation strategy based on the agents' interactions and rewards. We show that ACFA outperforms existing methods in terms of coalition stability and individual agent utility, and is robust to changes in the environment and agent preferences. We evaluate our approach using a simulated disaster response scenario, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.
