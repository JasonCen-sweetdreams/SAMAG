Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) often struggle to adapt to individual learners' needs, leading to frustration and disengagement. This paper introduces 'EyeGuide', an innovative ITS that leverages eye-tracking data to dynamically adjust problem difficulty in real-time. Our approach uses machine learning to analyze pupil dilation, fixation duration, and scanpath patterns to infer learners' cognitive load and knowledge gaps. A user study with 120 participants demonstrates that EyeGuide significantly improves learning outcomes, reduces time-on-task, and enhances user experience compared to traditional ITS approaches.
