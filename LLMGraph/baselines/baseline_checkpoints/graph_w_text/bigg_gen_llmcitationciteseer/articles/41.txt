Identifying the intent behind a user's query is crucial for effective search results. While machine learning-based approaches have shown promise, they often rely on labeled datasets, which are expensive to create and domain-specific. This paper proposes an unsupervised query intent identification framework, 'IntentMine', that leverages domain knowledge graphs to categorize queries into fine-grained intent types. We develop a novel graph-based clustering algorithm that captures semantic relationships between queries and entities in the knowledge graph. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset from a domain-specific search engine demonstrate that IntentMine outperforms state-of-the-art methods in intent accuracy and scalability.
