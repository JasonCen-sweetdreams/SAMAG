Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable successes in various robotics tasks, but its lack of transparency and interpretability hinders its deployment in real-world applications. This paper proposes a novel explainability framework, 'RL-Explain', which leverages attention mechanisms and model-based reinforcement learning to provide insights into DRL decision-making processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RL-Explain in a robotic grasping task, showing that it not only improves model interpretability but also enhances overall performance by identifying and correcting suboptimal policies.
