Conversational interfaces are increasingly being used in various domains, but their accessibility and usability for older adults remain a concern. This paper presents a Wizard-of-Oz study that explores the design of inclusive conversational interfaces for older adults. We developed a conversational system that uses natural language processing and machine learning to understand and respond to user input. Our study involved 20 older adults who interacted with the system, and our results show that older adults prefer a more structured conversation flow and explicit cues for input. We also found that the use of multimodal feedback, such as voice and visual cues, improves the overall user experience. Our findings have implications for the design of conversational interfaces that are accessible and usable by older adults.
