Autonomous urban traffic management requires efficient coordination among multiple agents, including vehicles, traffic lights, and pedestrians. This paper presents a novel decentralized coordination framework, 'MACTraffic', which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning and graph neural networks to optimize traffic flow. MACTraffic integrates real-time data from various sources, including traffic cameras, sensors, and GPS, to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions. Our experiments on a large-scale simulated urban traffic network demonstrate significant reductions in congestion, travel time, and emissions compared to traditional centralized approaches.
