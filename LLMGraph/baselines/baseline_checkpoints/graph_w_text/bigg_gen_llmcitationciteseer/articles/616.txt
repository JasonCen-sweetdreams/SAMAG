Real-time data warehousing demands efficient indexing mechanisms to support high-performance query processing. This paper presents 'RTIndex', a novel indexing framework that adapts to dynamic data distributions and query workloads. RTIndex employs a hierarchical indexing structure, combining Bloom filters and learned indexes, to minimize indexing overhead and optimize query response times. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world IoT dataset demonstrates that RTIndex outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query throughput and 2x in indexing speed.
