As data volumes continue to grow, distributed database systems face significant challenges in maintaining data consistency and ensuring high availability. This paper proposes a novel data replication scheme, 'RepliGuard', which leverages a combination of erasure coding and homomorphic encryption to achieve scalability and security. RepliGuard enables efficient data replication across geographically dispersed nodes while providing robust protection against data breaches and unauthorized access. Our experimental evaluation on a Apache Cassandra cluster demonstrates that RepliGuard outperforms existing replication schemes in terms of performance, security, and storage overhead.
