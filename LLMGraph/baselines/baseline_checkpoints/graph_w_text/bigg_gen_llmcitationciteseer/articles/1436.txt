As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular. However, optimizing queries in DDS remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization technique, 'HierOpt', which leverages hierarchical clustering to group correlated data fragments and reduce query latency. Our approach exploits the inherent structure of the data to identify optimal join orders and minimize inter-node communication. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HierOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 35% in terms of query response time.
