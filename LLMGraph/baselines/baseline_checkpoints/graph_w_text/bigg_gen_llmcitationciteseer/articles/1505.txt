Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in various graph-based applications. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised concerns. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph refinement approach to enhance the robustness of GNNs. We introduce a graph coarsening strategy that iteratively merges nodes and edges, thereby creating a hierarchy of refined graphs. Our method, 'HierGARD', adaptively selects the most informative nodes and edges at each level, resulting in a more robust representation of the graph structure. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierGARD improves the adversarial robustness of GNNs while maintaining their performance on clean data.
