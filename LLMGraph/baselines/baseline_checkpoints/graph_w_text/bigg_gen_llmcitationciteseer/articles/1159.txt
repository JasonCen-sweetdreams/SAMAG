Session-based query suggestion aims to recommend relevant queries to users based on their search history. Existing methods rely on traditional collaborative filtering or Markov chain-based models, which struggle to capture complex user behavior. We propose a novel deep neural ranking model, SessionRNN, which leverages recurrent neural networks to model user search sessions and generates personalized query suggestions. Our experiments on a large-scale search log dataset demonstrate that SessionRNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of query suggestion accuracy and diversity.
