Virtual reality (VR) games often struggle to provide an optimal difficulty level for players, leading to frustration or boredom. This paper presents 'GazeDAA', a novel approach that leverages eye-tracking data to adapt game difficulty in real-time. By analyzing the player's gaze patterns, our system infers their attention and expertise, adjusting the game's challenge level accordingly. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that GazeDAA improves player engagement, reduces frustration, and enhances overall gaming experience.
