Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability for elderly users with cognitive impairments remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to create an inclusive voice assistant that accommodates the needs of this population. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants with mild cognitive impairment, identifying three key design principles: simplification of voice commands, provision of visual feedback, and incorporation of cognitive aids. We implemented these principles in a prototype voice assistant and evaluated its effectiveness in a controlled experiment. Results show significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing commercial voice assistants.
