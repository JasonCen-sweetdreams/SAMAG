Open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents for answer extraction. This paper proposes a novel approach to passage retrieval using sparse document representations, which reduces the dimensionality of the document embedding space while preserving semantic information. Our method, dubbed 'SparseRetriever', leverages a combination of sparse autoencoders and document frequency-based weighting to generate compact document representations. Experimental results on the Natural Questions benchmark demonstrate that SparseRetriever outperforms state-of-the-art dense retrieval methods in terms of both retrieval efficiency and ODQA performance.
