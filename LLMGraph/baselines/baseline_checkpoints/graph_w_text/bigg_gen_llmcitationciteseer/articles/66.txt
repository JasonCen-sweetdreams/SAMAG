Search engines often struggle to provide diverse results, leading to a poor user experience. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using graph-based semantic embeddings. We represent queries and documents as nodes in a graph, and leverage graph convolutional networks to learn semantic embeddings that capture nuanced relationships between them. Our approach, 'DiversiGraph', adaptively expands the query by incorporating relevant terms from the graph, resulting in more diverse search results. Experimental evaluations on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search result diversity and relevance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
