Distributed database systems are increasingly used to manage large-scale data-intensive applications. However, optimizing query performance in these systems is a challenging task due to the complexity of the underlying infrastructure and the variability of the workload. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages multi-armed bandit algorithms to adaptively select the optimal query plan based on the runtime performance of the system. Our approach uses online learning to balance exploration and exploitation, and we demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing query latency and improving system throughput using a real-world dataset.
