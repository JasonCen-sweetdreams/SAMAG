Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but existing methods struggle to capture temporal dependencies in dynamic networks. We propose a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HiGAT) that leverages both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to model node relationships. HiGAT utilizes a hierarchical architecture to aggregate features across multiple scales, enabling the capture of complex patterns in dynamic networks. Our experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that HiGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in node classification accuracy and robustness.
