Document retrieval systems rely on effective query representation to retrieve relevant documents. In this paper, we propose a novel neural query expansion (NQE) approach that leverages unsupervised learning to improve document retrieval performance. Our NQE model learns to generate context-aware query expansions by optimizing a combination of relevance and coherence objectives. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion techniques and achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised document retrieval settings.
