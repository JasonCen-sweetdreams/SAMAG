Query representation is a crucial component of information retrieval (IR) systems, as it directly affects the retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to enrich query representation by incorporating entity disambiguation. We leverage knowledge graphs to identify entities mentioned in the query and disambiguate them using a graph-based algorithm. The enriched query representation is then used to re-rank the retrieved documents, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art IR models, particularly for queries with ambiguous entities.
