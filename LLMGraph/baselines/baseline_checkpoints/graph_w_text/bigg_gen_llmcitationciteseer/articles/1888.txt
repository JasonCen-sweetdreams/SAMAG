Virtual reality (VR) has transformed the way we interact with digital information, but designing effective user interfaces remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user engagement in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, comparing three avatar customization levels: minimal, moderate, and extensive. Our results show that moderate customization leads to significant improvements in user satisfaction, task completion time, and perceived immersion. We also identify key factors influencing avatar design, including facial similarity, body type, and clothing style. Our findings have important implications for the development of more engaging and effective VR interfaces.
