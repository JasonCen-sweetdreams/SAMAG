Open-domain question answering (ODQA) models rely on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents from a massive corpus. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document embedding approach, 'HDemb', which captures both local and global semantic relationships between passages. By learning a hierarchical representation of documents, HDemb enables fast and accurate passage retrieval using a combination of coarse-grained and fine-grained similarity metrics. Experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HDemb outperforms state-of-the-art dense retrieval models in terms of recall and inference speed.
