As the global population ages, it is essential to design accessible interfaces that cater to the needs of older adults with cognitive impairments. This paper presents a multimodal interface framework that combines speech, gesture, and tactile input to facilitate intuitive interaction. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults with mild cognitive impairment, evaluating the effectiveness of our framework in comparison to traditional unimodal interfaces. Results show significant improvements in task completion time, accuracy, and user satisfaction. We also provide guidelines for interface designers to create accessible multimodal systems for this demographic.
