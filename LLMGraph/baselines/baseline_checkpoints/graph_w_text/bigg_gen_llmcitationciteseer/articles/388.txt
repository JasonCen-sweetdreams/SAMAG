In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages auction-based mechanisms to allocate tasks to autonomous agents. We propose a novel auction protocol that incorporates agents' private valuations and task dependencies, ensuring efficient and fair task allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utility. We also provide a formal analysis of the protocol's convergence and stability properties.
