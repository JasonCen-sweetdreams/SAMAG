Node classification is a fundamental problem in graph-structured data, where the goal is to predict the label of a node based on its features and graph structure. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention-based graph neural network (HAGNN) architecture, which leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant neighbors at multiple graph scales. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGNN on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on node classification tasks. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of the learned attention patterns, revealing insights into the underlying graph structure and node relationships.
