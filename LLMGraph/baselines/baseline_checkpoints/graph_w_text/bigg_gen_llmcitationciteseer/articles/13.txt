Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design an RL agent that learns to select the most efficient query plans based on the underlying system dynamics and workload characteristics. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that our approach achieves significant improvements in query response time and throughput compared to traditional rule-based optimization techniques.
