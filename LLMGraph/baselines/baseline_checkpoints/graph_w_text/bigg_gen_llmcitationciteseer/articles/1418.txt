Individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder affecting articulation, face significant barriers when interacting with voice-based interfaces. This paper presents the design and evaluation of an accessible voice-based interface, 'EasyVoice', tailored to the needs of users with dysarthria. We employed a participatory design approach, involving users with dysarthria in the design process, to create a novel speech recognition system that leverages error correction and personalized feedback mechanisms. Our user study with 20 participants demonstrates that EasyVoice significantly improves the accuracy and confidence of voice-based interactions for users with dysarthria, compared to commercial speech recognition systems.
