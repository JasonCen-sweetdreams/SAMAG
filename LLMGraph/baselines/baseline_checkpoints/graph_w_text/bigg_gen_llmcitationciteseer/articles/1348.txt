This research focuses on designing voice-assisted conversational systems that cater to elderly users with cognitive impairments. We conducted a user study to identify the key challenges and requirements for such systems. Our findings indicate that users with cognitive impairments face difficulties with complex voice commands, memory recall, and understanding system responses. We propose a novel design framework, 'EASE', which incorporates simplicity, consistency, and feedback mechanisms to facilitate user understanding and interaction. A prototype system was developed and evaluated, showing significant improvements in user engagement, task completion rates, and overall satisfaction.
