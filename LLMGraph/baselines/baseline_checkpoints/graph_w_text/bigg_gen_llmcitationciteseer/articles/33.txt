Medical document retrieval systems often struggle to accurately retrieve relevant documents due to the limitations of bag-of-words representations. This paper proposes a neural query expansion approach, leveraging domain-specific knowledge graphs to enrich query representations. Our model, MedQE, injects semantic relationships between medical entities and concepts into the query expansion process, resulting in improved retrieval performance. Experimental results on the TREC-CDS dataset demonstrate significant gains in precision and recall compared to traditional query expansion methods.
