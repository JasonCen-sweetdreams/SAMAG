This paper proposes a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for distributed resource allocation in complex systems. We introduce a hierarchical agent architecture that combines local and global decision-making, enabling efficient allocation of resources in large-scale networks. Our approach leverages a decentralized actor-critic algorithm with experience sharing and asynchronous updates, allowing agents to adapt to changing system conditions. Experimental results on a simulated grid network demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization and system performance compared to traditional centralized optimization methods.
