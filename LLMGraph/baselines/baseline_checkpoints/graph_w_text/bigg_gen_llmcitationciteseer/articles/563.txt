In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework, 'MADRA', which leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments. MADRA uses a decentralized, asynchronous learning approach, where agents learn to allocate tasks based on partial observations of the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that MADRA outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and overall system efficiency, even in dynamic and uncertain environments.
