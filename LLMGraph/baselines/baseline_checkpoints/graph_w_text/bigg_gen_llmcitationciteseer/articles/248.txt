Ad-hoc retrieval poses significant challenges due to the complexity of user queries and the need for effective query reformulation. This paper presents a novel approach, DeepQR, which leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn an optimal query reformulation policy. By modeling the retrieval process as a Markov decision process, we train an agent to reformulate queries based on user feedback and relevance signals. Experimental results on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval dataset demonstrate that DeepQR outperforms state-of-the-art query reformulation techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
