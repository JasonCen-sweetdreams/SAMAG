Real-time data warehousing has become a crucial component of modern business intelligence, but query optimization remains a significant bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based approach to optimize query performance in real-time data warehouses. We develop a query predictor model that leverages historical query patterns and workload characteristics to anticipate query execution times. Our approach, called 'QPML', incorporates a probabilistic cost model and a reinforcement learning framework to dynamically adjust query plans and reduce optimization overhead. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that QPML outperforms traditional query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of average query response time.
