Modern search engines rely heavily on query expansion techniques to improve document retrieval accuracy. However, existing methods often suffer from high computational costs and suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query expansion framework, 'HQE', which leverages both local and global context to selectively expand query terms. We introduce a new relevance-based clustering algorithm that groups semantically similar documents, enabling efficient and effective query expansion. Experimental results on the TREC-2020 dataset demonstrate that HQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both precision and recall, while reducing computational overhead by up to 30%.
