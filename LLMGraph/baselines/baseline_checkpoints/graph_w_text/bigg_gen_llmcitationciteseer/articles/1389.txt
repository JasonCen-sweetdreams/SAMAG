Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is a challenging task, particularly when labeled data is scarce. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach, GraAE, which leverages graph-based autoencoders to identify anomalies in multivariate time series data. We represent the time series data as a graph, where each node corresponds to a variable and edges represent correlations between variables. The autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the graph, and anomalies are detected by identifying nodes with high reconstruction errors. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and speed.
