Coordinating the actions of multiple agents in complex, dynamic environments is a challenging problem in multi-agent systems. This paper proposes a novel approach using hierarchical graph attention networks (HGANs) to learn effective coordination strategies. Our method represents the agent interaction graph as a hierarchical structure, allowing the model to capture both local and global dependencies between agents. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarks, including traffic management and robotic soccer, and show significant improvements in coordination performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
