The cold start problem in recommendation systems occurs when there is insufficient interaction data for new users or items. This paper proposes a novel hybrid retrieval model, 'Hyperion', which combines the strengths of collaborative filtering and natural language processing. Hyperion leverages item embeddings and contextualized user representations to generate personalized recommendations. Our experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate a significant improvement in recommendation accuracy and diversity compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also show that Hyperion is robust to sparse interactions and outperforms existing cold start solutions.
