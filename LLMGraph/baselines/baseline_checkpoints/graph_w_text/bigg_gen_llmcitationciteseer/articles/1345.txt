Ad-hoc retrieval in narrow domains poses unique challenges due to the limited scope and specificity of the queries. This paper proposes a context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages external knowledge graphs and domain-specific ontologies to disambiguate query terms and inject relevant concepts. Our approach incorporates a novel graph-based ranking model that captures the semantic relationships between query terms, expansion terms, and document content. Experimental results on three narrow-domain collections show that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving up to 25% improvement in mean average precision.
