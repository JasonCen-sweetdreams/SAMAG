Open-domain question answering (ODQA) requires effective passage retrieval to identify relevant text snippets for answer extraction. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention (HGA) framework to enhance passage retrieval for ODQA. HGA exploits the graph structure of documents to model relationships between passages, entities, and keywords. We introduce a multi-level attention mechanism that adaptively weights passage representation, entity mentions, and keyword occurrences. Experimental results on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that our approach improves passage retrieval accuracy by 12.5% and overall ODQA performance by 7.2% compared to state-of-the-art methods.
