Individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder resulting from neurological conditions, often face difficulties interacting with voice assistants. This paper presents an inclusive design approach to develop voice assistants that cater to users with dysarthria. We conducted participatory design workshops with individuals with dysarthria, caregivers, and speech therapists to identify accessibility barriers and co-design solutions. Our proposed system incorporates acoustic models adapted to dysarthric speech patterns, error correction mechanisms, and personalized feedback strategies. A usability study with 20 participants demonstrated significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
