Current search engines often prioritize relevance over diversity, leading to homogeneous search results. This paper proposes a novel deep re-ranking approach, 'HierDiv', which leverages hierarchical graph neural networks to capture complex relationships between query, documents, and entities. HierDiv jointly optimizes relevance, diversity, and novelty metrics, resulting in more comprehensive and informative search results. Experimental evaluations on a large-scale web search dataset demonstrate significant improvements in search result diversity and user satisfaction.
