Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents a human-centered study on the impact of cognitive load on users with visual impairments when interacting with voice assistants. We developed a novel error recovery framework that incorporates personalized feedback and adaptive prompting, reducing cognitive load and improving task completion rates. Our user study with 30 participants demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms existing error recovery mechanisms, highlighting the importance of inclusive design in voice assistant development.
