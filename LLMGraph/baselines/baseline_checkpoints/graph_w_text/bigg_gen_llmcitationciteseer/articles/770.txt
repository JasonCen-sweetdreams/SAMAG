Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important for timely business decision-making. However, optimizing queries for low latency and high throughput remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'RtOpt', that leverages column-store indexes to accelerate query execution. We propose a cost-based optimization algorithm that considers both data storage and query patterns to select the most efficient indexing strategy. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RtOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in query response time while maintaining comparable storage overhead.
