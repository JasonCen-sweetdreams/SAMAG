Query expansion is a crucial technique for enhancing the retrieval performance of search engines, particularly in hierarchical document collections. However, existing methods often incur significant computational overhead and may not effectively capture the nuances of user queries. This paper proposes a relevance-based query expansion approach, dubbed 'HierExpan', which leverages hierarchical relationships to identify the most informative expansion terms. Our approach is grounded in a probabilistic framework that models the relevance of expansion terms to the original query, allowing for efficient pruning of irrelevant terms. Experimental results on a large-scale hierarchical dataset demonstrate that HierExpan outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness.
