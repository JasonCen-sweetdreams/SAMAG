As autonomous vehicles (AVs) increasingly rely on AI-driven perception systems, they become vulnerable to adversarial attacks. This paper presents a novel approach to detect such attacks using graph attention networks (GATs). We propose a GAT-based architecture that learns to identify suspicious patterns in AV sensor data, leveraging the graph structure of the sensor interactions. Our experiments on a large-scale AV dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 25% improvement in attack detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further analyze the interpretability of our model, providing insights into the most critical sensors and features contributing to attack detection.
