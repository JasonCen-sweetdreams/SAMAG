Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a crucial task in natural language processing, which involves identifying sentiment polarities towards specific aspects or features in user reviews. Existing ABSA models often neglect the hierarchical structure of aspects and their relationships, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) architecture that captures aspect dependencies and sentiment propagation. Our HAN model consists of a sentiment-aware aspect encoder and a hierarchical attention mechanism, which learns to focus on relevant aspects and contextualize sentiment expressions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of aspect-level sentiment accuracy and overall F1-score.
