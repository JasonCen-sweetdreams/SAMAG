Ad-hoc retrieval remains a fundamental challenge in information retrieval (IR). This paper proposes a novel neural re-ranking approach, dubbed 'NeuQE', which leverages query expansion to improve retrieval effectiveness. NeuQE combines a neural query expansion module with a re-ranking model that learns to predict the relevance of documents based on their semantic similarity to the expanded query. Experimental results on the TREC Robust04 and ClueWeb09 datasets demonstrate that NeuQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion techniques and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
