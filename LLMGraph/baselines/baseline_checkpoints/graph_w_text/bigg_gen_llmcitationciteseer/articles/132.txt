Conversational search systems aim to facilitate more natural and interactive search experiences. However, accurately interpreting user queries remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'ConvRef', to reformulate ambiguous or incomplete queries. Our method leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture contextual dependencies between query terms and incorporates a reinforcement learning component to optimize the reformulation process. Experimental results on a large-scale conversational search dataset demonstrate that ConvRef outperforms state-of-the-art query reformulation techniques, leading to improved search result relevance and user satisfaction.
