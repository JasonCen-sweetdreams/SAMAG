Question answering over knowledge graphs (KGs) often requires multi-hop reasoning, which can be challenging due to the complexity of KG structures. This paper presents a novel approach, HATKE, that leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to learn more informative entity and relation embeddings. Our method adaptively focuses on relevant KG subgraphs and captures nuanced semantic relationships, enabling more accurate question answering. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HATKE, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 12% in terms of answer accuracy.
