Query expansion is a crucial step in search engine retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and heuristic rules. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages deep neural networks to learn query expansion strategies from large-scale search logs. Our model, called DeepQE, incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture complex relationships between query terms and documents. Experimental results on a large web corpus demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in retrieval performance and relevance.
