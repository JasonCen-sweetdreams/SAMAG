As data volumes continue to grow, query optimization in parallel distributed databases becomes increasingly complex. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'ParOpt', that leverages machine learning to predict optimal query plans. We design a neural network that learns from database statistics, query patterns, and execution times to generate efficient query plans. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that ParOpt outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of execution time, while maintaining comparable accuracy.
