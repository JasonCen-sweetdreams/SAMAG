In complex systems, coordinating multiple agents to achieve efficient resource allocation is a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to train a decentralized controller for multi-agent systems. Our method, called 'MARL-RA', enables agents to learn optimal resource allocation strategies through interactions with the environment and other agents. Experimental results demonstrate that MARL-RA outperforms traditional methods in terms of resource utilization and system efficiency, while also adapting to dynamic changes in the environment.
