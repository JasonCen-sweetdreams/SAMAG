Virtual reality (VR) technology has the potential to revolutionize remote collaboration by providing an immersive and interactive environment. However, the impact of VR on social presence and embodiment in collaborative tasks is not well understood. In this study, we investigate the effects of VR-mediated collaboration on user experience, communication patterns, and task performance. Our results show that VR significantly enhances social presence and embodiment compared to traditional video conferencing, leading to improved collaboration outcomes. We also identify key design factors that influence user experience and provide guidelines for VR-mediated collaboration systems.
