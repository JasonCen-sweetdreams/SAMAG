We present a novel decentralized task allocation framework for autonomous agents, which leverages distributed constraint optimization (DCOP) to efficiently assign tasks to agents in a multi-agent system. Our approach, dubbed 'AgentDCOP', enables agents to negotiate and coordinate with each other to find a globally optimal task allocation, while respecting individual agent capabilities and constraints. Experimental results on a simulated urban search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that AgentDCOP outperforms existing centralized and decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization. The proposed framework is scalable, flexible, and suitable for real-world applications involving autonomous agents.
