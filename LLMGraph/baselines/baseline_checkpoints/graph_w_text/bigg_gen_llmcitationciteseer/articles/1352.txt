This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to enhance user experience. We designed a gesture-based interface that leverages the cognitive benefits of bodily engagement, allowing users to manipulate virtual objects with natural gestures. A user study (N=30) compared our embodied interface with a traditional controller-based interface, revealing significant improvements in spatial awareness, object manipulation accuracy, and overall user satisfaction. Our findings have implications for the design of more intuitive and immersive VR interactions, particularly in domains such as education, training, and entertainment.
