Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph-structured data. However, efficient indexing mechanisms are crucial to support fast query execution. This paper proposes a novel indexing approach, HBF-G, which leverages hierarchical Bloom filters to index graph data across distributed nodes. Our approach reduces the number of nodes to be queried, resulting in significant performance improvements for graph traversal and pattern matching queries. Experimental evaluation on real-world graph datasets demonstrates that HBF-G outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of storage efficiency.
