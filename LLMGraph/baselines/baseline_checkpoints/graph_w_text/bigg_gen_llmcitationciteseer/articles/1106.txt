In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention framework, 'HierAttn', which leverages the structural properties of agent relationships to allocate tasks effectively. By recursively applying graph attention mechanisms, HierAttn captures both local and global dependencies between agents, enabling the identification of optimal task assignments. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization compared to existing allocation strategies.
