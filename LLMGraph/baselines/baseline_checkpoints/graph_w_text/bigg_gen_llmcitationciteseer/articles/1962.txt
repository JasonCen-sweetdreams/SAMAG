Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their design often neglects the needs of users with disabilities. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing inclusive voice assistants, focusing on users with visual, hearing, and motor impairments. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with disability advocates and users, identifying key barriers and opportunities for improvement. Our proposed system, 'AccessibleVoice', incorporates personalized interfaces, multimodal feedback, and adaptive error correction to enhance accessibility and user experience. A pilot study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to commercial voice assistants.
