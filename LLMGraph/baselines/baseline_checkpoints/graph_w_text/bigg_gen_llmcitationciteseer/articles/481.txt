Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in smart homes, but their usability for older adults is often hindered by cognitive and sensory impairments. This paper presents a multimodal design framework for inclusive voice assistants, which combines speech, gesture, and visual cues to facilitate interaction. Our user study with 30 older adults (ages 65-85) demonstrates that the proposed framework improves task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to traditional voice-only interfaces. We also discuss the implications of our findings for designing accessible HCI systems that cater to diverse user needs.
