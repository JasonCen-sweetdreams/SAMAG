This paper presents a novel approach to autonomous negotiation in multi-agent systems, leveraging deep reinforcement learning to optimize negotiation strategies. We propose a hierarchical framework, AgentNegotiator, which integrates a deep Q-network with a set of domain-specific heuristics to adapt to diverse negotiation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentNegotiator outperforms state-of-the-art negotiation strategies in terms of Pareto optimality, fairness, and robustness, while reducing the computational overhead. Our approach has significant implications for real-world applications, such as e-commerce, supply chain management, and conflict resolution.
