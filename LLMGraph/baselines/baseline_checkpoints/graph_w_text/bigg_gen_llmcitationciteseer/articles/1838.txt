Wheelchair users often face difficulties navigating through cluttered environments. This paper presents 'GazeNav', a novel gaze-based interaction system that enables intelligent wheelchair navigation. We leverage a machine learning model to predict the user's gaze direction and intent, allowing the wheelchair to autonomously avoid obstacles and follow desired paths. Our user study with 15 participants demonstrates that GazeNav reduces navigation time by 30% and improves overall user experience. We also discuss the system's limitations and potential applications in assistive technologies.
