As distributed database systems continue to grow in scale and complexity, query performance becomes a critical bottleneck. This paper presents a novel adaptive indexing technique, 'AIx', which dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distributions. AIx leverages machine learning-based prediction models to forecast query workloads and optimize index creation, resulting in significant improvements to query response times. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database system demonstrates that AIx outperforms traditional static indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query performance.
