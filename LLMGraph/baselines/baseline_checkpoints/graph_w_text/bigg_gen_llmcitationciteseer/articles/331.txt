Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents the design and evaluation of 'EASE', a novel voice-based interface tailored to the needs of this population. We employ a participatory design approach, involving older adults with cognitive impairments in the design process. Our interface incorporates cognitive support features, such as semantic cueing and error correction, to facilitate user interaction. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction compared to existing voice assistants.
