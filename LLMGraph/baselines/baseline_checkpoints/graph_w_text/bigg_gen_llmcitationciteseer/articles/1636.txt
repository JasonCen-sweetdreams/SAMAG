With the increasing demand for real-time analytics, traditional query optimization techniques fall short in handling large volumes of data. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'QRaptor', that leverages machine learning to predict optimal query execution plans for real-time data warehousing. QRaptor employs a hybrid approach, combining reinforcement learning with cost-based optimization, to minimize query latency and improve system throughput. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that QRaptor achieves an average query response time reduction of 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
