Query expansion is a crucial component of modern search engines, as it enhances the relevance of search results. However, the high dimensionality of document representations hinders the scalability of query expansion techniques. This paper proposes a novel document representation framework, 'DRIFT', which combines word embeddings with a novel dimensionality reduction technique. DRIFT enables efficient query expansion while preserving the semantic meaning of documents. Experimental results on a large-scale web corpus demonstrate that DRIFT outperforms existing methods in terms of both precision and query processing time.
