Distributed data warehouses have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data analytics. However, query optimization remains a significant challenge in such systems. This paper proposes a novel query optimization technique that leverages column store indexing to reduce query latency and improve resource utilization. Our approach, called 'ColOpt', uses a cost-based optimization framework that takes into account the underlying storage layout and data distribution. We evaluate ColOpt on a real-world dataset and demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to traditional row-store indexing approaches.
