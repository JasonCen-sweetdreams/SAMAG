Query expansion is a crucial component of information retrieval systems, as it aims to bridge the vocabulary gap between user queries and relevant documents. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach, 'SLQE', which leverages supervised learning to identify the most informative terms for expansion. We propose a neural network architecture that learns to predict the relevance of candidate expansion terms based on their semantic relationships with the original query. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that SLQE outperforms traditional unsupervised expansion methods, achieving a significant improvement in mean average precision.
