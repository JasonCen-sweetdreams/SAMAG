Materialized views are essential for efficient query processing in data warehouses, but their maintenance can be costly, especially in the presence of frequent data updates. This paper presents a novel incremental view maintenance technique, 'IVM+', that leverages a combination of data sampling, delta-based processing, and parallelization to achieve scalability and efficiency. We evaluate IVM+ on a real-world data warehouse and demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing approaches, with an average speedup of 3.5x for incremental view maintenance.
