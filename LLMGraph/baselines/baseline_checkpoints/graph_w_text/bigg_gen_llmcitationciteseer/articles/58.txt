High-dimensional time series data is ubiquitous in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. Anomaly detection in such data is crucial but challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'Hierarchical Temporal Autoencoder' (HTAE), which leverages the strengths of both autoencoders and hierarchical clustering. HTAE learns a compact representation of the data by hierarchically grouping similar time series and identifying anomalies at multiple scales. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of HTAE in detecting anomalies with high accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.
