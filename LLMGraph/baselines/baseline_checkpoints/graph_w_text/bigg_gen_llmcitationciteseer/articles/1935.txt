High-dimensional data indexing is a fundamental problem in various domains, including computer vision, recommender systems, and scientific computing. Existing indexing methods often suffer from poor scalability, high memory overhead, or inadequate query performance. This paper presents HiHT, a novel hierarchical hash table indexing scheme that tackles these challenges. HiHT leverages a hierarchical structure to efficiently prune the search space and reduces memory requirements through compact hash representations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HiHT outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of query performance, memory efficiency, and scalability for high-dimensional data.
