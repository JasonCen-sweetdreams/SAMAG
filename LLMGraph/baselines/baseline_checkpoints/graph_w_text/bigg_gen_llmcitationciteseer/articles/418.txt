Task allocation is a crucial problem in multi-agent systems, where agents with varying capabilities need to be assigned tasks to maximize overall efficiency. This paper presents a novel hierarchical task allocation framework that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) to model complex agent-task interactions. Our approach, called HTA-GNN, represents the agent-task graph as a hierarchical structure, allowing the GNN to capture both local and global dependencies. Experimental results on a variety of benchmark scenarios demonstrate that HTA-GNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
