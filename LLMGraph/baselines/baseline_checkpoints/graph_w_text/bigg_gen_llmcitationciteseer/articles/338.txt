Existing deep ranking models for multi-modal retrieval rely on homogeneous feedback signals, neglecting the diversity of user interactions. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'HeteRank', which incorporates heterogeneous feedback from various sources, including clicks, dwell time, and explicit ratings. We develop a multi-task learning approach that jointly optimizes ranking, click prediction, and rating regression tasks. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HeteRank significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a 12.3% improvement in NDCG@10 and a 9.5% increase in user engagement.
