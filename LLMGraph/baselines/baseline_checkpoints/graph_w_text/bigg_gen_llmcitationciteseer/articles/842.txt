Conversational agents have the potential to support older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing designs often neglect their unique needs. This paper presents a user-centered approach to designing accessible conversational agents, focusing on simplifying language, using multimodal interaction, and incorporating cognitive support. We conducted a series of usability studies with older adults with mild cognitive impairment, identifying key design recommendations and evaluating the effectiveness of our proposed design framework. Our results show improved task completion rates and user satisfaction, demonstrating the feasibility of accessible conversational agents for this population.
