Gesture recognition systems have the potential to improve the quality of life for older adults with motor impairments. However, existing systems often struggle to accurately recognize gestures performed by individuals with disabilities. This paper presents an adaptive gesture recognition framework that incorporates machine learning and computer vision techniques to accommodate varying levels of motor impairment. Our approach uses a hybrid model combining convolutional neural networks and hidden Markov models to recognize gestures, and adapts to individual users through an online learning mechanism. We evaluate our system with a user study involving 20 older adults with motor impairments, demonstrating improved recognition accuracy and user satisfaction.
