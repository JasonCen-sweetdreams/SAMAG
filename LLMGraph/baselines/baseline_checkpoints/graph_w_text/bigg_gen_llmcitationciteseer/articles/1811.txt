In autonomous multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize agent behavior. We introduce a decentralized, asynchronous learning approach that enables agents to adapt to dynamic task environments and learn effective allocation strategies. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and agent utility compared to traditional, hand-designed allocation methods. We also provide guarantees on the convergence of our algorithm under varying levels of agent communication and environmental uncertainty.
