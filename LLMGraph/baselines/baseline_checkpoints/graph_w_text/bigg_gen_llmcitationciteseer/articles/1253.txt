Real-time analytics in distributed database systems faces significant performance challenges due to dynamic workload and data distribution. This paper presents an adaptive query optimization framework, 'Aurora', that leverages online machine learning and statistical modeling to predict query performance and adjust optimization strategies accordingly. We introduce a novel cost model that incorporates data locality, node heterogeneity, and query complexity factors, enabling Aurora to optimize query plans for improved response time and throughput. Experimental results on a large-scale distributed database testbed demonstrate that Aurora outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x.
