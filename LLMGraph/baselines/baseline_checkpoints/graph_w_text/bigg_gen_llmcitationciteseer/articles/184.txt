In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a critical problem that affects overall system performance. This paper proposes a novel approach to task allocation using graph neural networks (GNNs) that can efficiently handle heterogeneous agent capabilities and dynamic task requirements. Our method, dubbed 'GNN-TA', represents the agent-task interaction as a graph and leverages GNNs to learn a task allocation policy that minimizes system latency and maximizes task completion rates. Experimental results on a simulated logistics scenario demonstrate that GNN-TA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of scalability, adaptability, and robustness.
