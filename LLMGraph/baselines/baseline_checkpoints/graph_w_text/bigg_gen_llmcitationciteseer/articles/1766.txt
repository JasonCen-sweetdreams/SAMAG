Neural retrieval models have shown significant improvements in document ranking tasks, but they often inherit biases from the training data, leading to unfair ranking results. This paper proposes a novel debiasing approach, 'FairRank', which incorporates a bias-aware regularization term into the neural ranking model. We introduce a new bias metric, 'Ranking Disparity', to measure the unfairness of the ranking results and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting biases. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that FairRank significantly reduces ranking biases while maintaining comparable ranking performance to state-of-the-art models.
