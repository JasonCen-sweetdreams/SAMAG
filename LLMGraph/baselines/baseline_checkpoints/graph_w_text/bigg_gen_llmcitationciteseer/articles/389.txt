Autonomous vehicles require real-time control decisions that balance competing objectives, such as safety, efficiency, and passenger comfort. This paper presents a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework, 'MORL-AV', which leverages a deep Q-network to learn a Pareto-optimal policy for autonomous vehicle control. MORL-AV incorporates a customized reward function that aggregating multiple objectives and utilizes a hierarchical exploration strategy to efficiently search the action space. Experimental results demonstrate that MORL-AV outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various simulated driving scenarios, achieving improved overall performance and reduced computational overhead.
