As robots increasingly interact with humans in various settings, understanding the role of embodiment in human-robot collaboration is crucial. This paper presents a virtual reality (VR) study exploring the effects of robotic embodiment on human trust, communication, and task performance in a collaborative assembly task. Results show that participants who interacted with an embodied robot (i.e., a robot with a physical presence in VR) exhibited higher levels of trust and communicated more effectively compared to those interacting with a non-embodied robot. Furthermore, embodied robots improved task performance by facilitating more efficient coordination and reducing errors. Our findings have implications for the design of future human-robot collaborative systems.
