Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but designing effective user interfaces remains a challenge. This paper explores the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience in VR. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, using a mixed-methods approach to investigate the impact of customized avatars on user engagement, presence, and overall satisfaction. Our results show that personalized avatars significantly improve user experience, particularly for users with high self-identification with their avatar. We discuss the implications of our findings for VR interface design and provide recommendations for future research.
