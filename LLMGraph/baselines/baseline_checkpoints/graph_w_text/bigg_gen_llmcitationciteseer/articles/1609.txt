In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages auction-based mechanisms to facilitate agent-to-agent negotiation. Our approach, dubbed 'AuctionMA', incorporates a novel bidding strategy that considers both task priority and agent capabilities. We prove that AuctionMA converges to an optimal allocation in polynomial time and demonstrate its effectiveness in a simulated search-and-rescue scenario. Experimental results show that AuctionMA outperforms existing decentralized allocation methods in terms of task completion rate and resource utilization.
