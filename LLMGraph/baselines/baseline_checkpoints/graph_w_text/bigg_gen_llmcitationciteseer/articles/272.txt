Distributed database systems have become increasingly prevalent in modern data centers, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel adaptive indexing technique that dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distributions. Our approach, called 'ADAPTIX', leverages machine learning models to predict query access patterns and adaptively reorganize indexes to minimize query latency. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that ADAPTIX achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional static indexing methods.
