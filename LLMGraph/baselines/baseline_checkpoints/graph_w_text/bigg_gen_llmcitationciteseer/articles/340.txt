Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the retrieval effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach to query expansion, which leverages the semantic relationships between words in the query and document collections. Our approach, called DeepQE, uses a combination of word embeddings and a neural network to learn the optimal query expansion strategy. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion methods, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
