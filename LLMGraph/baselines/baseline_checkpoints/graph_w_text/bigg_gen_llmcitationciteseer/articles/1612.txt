Heterogeneous networks, which contain nodes and edges of different types, are ubiquitous in real-world applications. However, existing node representation methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between nodes. This paper proposes a novel deep graph contrastive learning framework, 'HetGraphCL', which leverages the structural information in heterogeneous networks to learn robust node representations. We introduce a graph-aware contrastive loss function that encourages nodes to be close to their similar nodes and far from dissimilar ones. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HetGraphCL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification and graph clustering tasks.
