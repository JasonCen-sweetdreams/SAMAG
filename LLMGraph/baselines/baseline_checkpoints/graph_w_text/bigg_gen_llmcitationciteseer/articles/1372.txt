Augmented reality (AR) museum exhibitions have the potential to enhance visitor engagement, but the design of gestural interfaces can significantly impact user experience. This paper presents a user-centered design approach for creating intelligible gestural interfaces for AR museum exhibitions. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving user observations, interviews, and experiments to develop a set of design guidelines for AR gestures. Our evaluation of a prototype AR exhibit showed that participants using our designed gestures reported higher levels of satisfaction and understanding compared to a baseline condition. We discuss implications for future AR museum exhibitions and highlight the importance of considering user cognition and behavior in gestural interface design.
