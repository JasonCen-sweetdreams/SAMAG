This paper presents a human-centred design approach to developing embodied conversational agents (ECAs) for supporting older adults in healthcare settings. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with older adults, caregivers, and healthcare professionals to identify the key requirements for ECAs in this domain. Our findings highlight the importance of empathy, trust, and personalisation in ECA design. We propose a novel ECA framework that incorporates these factors, and evaluate its effectiveness in a pilot study with older adults. The results show significant improvements in user engagement, satisfaction, and health outcomes. Our work contributes to the development of more effective and user-friendly ECAs for healthcare support.
