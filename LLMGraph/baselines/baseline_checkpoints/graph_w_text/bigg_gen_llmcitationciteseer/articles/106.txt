As main-memory database systems become increasingly prevalent, optimizing query processing has become a crucial challenge. This paper proposes a novel hashed indexing technique, ' QuickHash', which leverages the properties of modern CPU architectures to accelerate query execution. QuickHash utilizes a combination of hash functions and cache-friendly data structures to minimize memory accesses and reduce query latency. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that QuickHash outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3.5x, while maintaining comparable storage efficiency.
