Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent in various applications, but understanding user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the role of emotional feedback in enhancing user engagement in conversational interfaces. We designed an intelligent chatbot that incorporates emotional feedback mechanisms, such as affective responses and empathetic statements, to investigate their impact on user experience. Our user study involving 100 participants reveals that emotional feedback significantly increases user engagement, with participants reporting higher satisfaction and perceived social presence. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of more effective conversational interfaces.
