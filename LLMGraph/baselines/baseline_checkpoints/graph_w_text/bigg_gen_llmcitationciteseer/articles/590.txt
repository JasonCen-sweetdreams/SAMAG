Dialogue management is a crucial component of multi-agent systems, where agents interact with each other to achieve a common goal. However, existing approaches often suffer from high computational complexity and limited scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for efficient multi-agent dialogue management. Our HAN model leverages attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant agents and utterances, reducing the computational overhead while improving dialogue coherence. Experimental results on a large-scale multi-agent dialogue dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of response accuracy and computational efficiency.
