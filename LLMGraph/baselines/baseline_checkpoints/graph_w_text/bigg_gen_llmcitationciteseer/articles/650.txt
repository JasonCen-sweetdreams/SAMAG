As distributed database systems (DDS) continue to scale, query performance optimization becomes increasingly challenging. This paper presents an adaptive indexing approach, 'AIQ', that dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distributions. AIQ utilizes a reinforcement learning framework to optimize index selection, leveraging graph-based representations of query plans and data statistics. Experimental results on a real-world DDS benchmark demonstrate significant improvements in query latency and throughput, outperforming state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 30%.
