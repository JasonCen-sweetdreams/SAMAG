As data volumes continue to grow, distributed database systems face significant scalability challenges. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraDix', which leverages the structural properties of data graphs to optimize query performance. By representing data relationships as a graph, GraDix enables efficient query routing, reduces data redundancy, and improves data locality. Experiments on a large-scale social network dataset demonstrate that GraDix outperforms traditional indexing methods by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage efficiency.
