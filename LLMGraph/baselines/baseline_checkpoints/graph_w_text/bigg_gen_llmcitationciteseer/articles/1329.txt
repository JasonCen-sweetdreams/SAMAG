Virtual assistants (VAs) have become ubiquitous, but their usability for older adults remains a concern. This study investigates the design of inclusive multimodal interfaces for VAs, focusing on voice, gesture, and text inputs. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, exploring their preferences, challenges, and behaviors when interacting with VAs. Our findings highlight the importance of adaptive feedback, personalized assistance, and multimodal redundancy to facilitate accessibility and trust. We propose a set of design guidelines for VA developers to create more inclusive and supportive interfaces for older adults.
