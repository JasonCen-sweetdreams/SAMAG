Collaborative virtual reality (VR) environments have the potential to revolutionize decision-making processes, but current visualization approaches often fail to effectively support group decision-making. This paper proposes an adaptive visualization framework that leverages real-time user feedback and cognitive load assessment to dynamically adjust visualization parameters. Our approach incorporates machine learning-based user modeling and multi-modal interaction techniques to facilitate more effective collaboration and decision-making. A user study with 20 participants demonstrates significant improvements in decision quality and user satisfaction compared to traditional visualization methods.
