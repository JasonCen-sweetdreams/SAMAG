This paper presents a novel approach to designing accessible gestural interfaces for older adults using machine learning-based gesture recognition. We propose a framework that employs a combination of computer vision and machine learning techniques to recognize and classify gestures performed by older adults. Our approach incorporates a user-centered design methodology, involving co-design sessions with older adults to identify and prioritize gestural interactions that are intuitive and easy to perform. We evaluate our approach using a prototype system and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the accessibility and usability of gestural interfaces for older adults.
