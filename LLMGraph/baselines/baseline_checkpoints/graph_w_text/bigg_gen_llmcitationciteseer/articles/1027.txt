This paper presents a novel decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with diverse capabilities and resource constraints need to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. We propose a distributed auction-based mechanism that leverages graph neural networks to learn agent-specific utility functions and dynamically allocate tasks to maximize system-wide efficiency. Our approach is validated through extensive simulations on a variety of task allocation scenarios, demonstrating improved performance and robustness compared to existing centralized and decentralized methods.
