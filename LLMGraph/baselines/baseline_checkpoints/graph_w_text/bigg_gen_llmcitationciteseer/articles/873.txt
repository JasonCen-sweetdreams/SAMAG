The increasing adoption of RDF graph databases in various domains has led to a surge in query complexity and data distribution. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RDF-QO', that leverages graph partitioning, query rewriting, and distributed query execution to improve query performance in distributed RDF graph databases. We introduce a cost-based optimization approach that considers the trade-off between query execution time and data transfer overhead. Experimental results on a real-world RDF dataset demonstrate that RDF-QO outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time and 25% in terms of data transfer reduction.
