Conversational search systems require effective query expansion techniques to capture the nuances of natural language queries. We propose a novel approach, 'ConvEx', which leverages context-aware embeddings to model the relationships between query terms, entities, and user intent. By incorporating contextualized language models and knowledge graph embeddings, ConvEx generates expanded queries that better capture the user's information need. Experimental results on a large conversational search dataset demonstrate that ConvEx outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, improving retrieval accuracy and reducing computational overhead.
