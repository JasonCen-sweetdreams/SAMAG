Modern search engines face the challenge of efficiently retrieving relevant documents from massive indexes. This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive re-ranking approach, 'QAR', that leverages neural query embeddings and document representations to re-rank the initial retrieval results. QAR learns to adapt to the query context and importance of different ranking features, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness and efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on the TREC Web Track dataset, demonstrating that QAR outperforms state-of-the-art re-ranking methods while reducing computational overhead.
