Few-shot image classification has gained significant attention in recent years. However, existing approaches often suffer from high computational costs and limited generalizability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HCL) framework that leverages a multi-level representation hierarchy to learn effective few-shot classifiers. By combining contrastive learning with a hierarchical attention mechanism, HCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while reducing computational costs by up to 50%. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HCL in adapting to novel classes and unseen domains.
