Imbalanced data streams, where the majority class dominates the minority class, pose significant challenges to online learning algorithms. We propose an adaptive ensemble method, 'AdaStream', which dynamically adjusts the contribution of each base learner based on their performance on the current data chunk. Our approach leverages a novel metric, 'stream-wise F1-score', to monitor the classification performance and adapt the ensemble weights. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that AdaStream outperforms state-of-the-art online learning algorithms in terms of F1-score, G-mean, and AUC, while maintaining a low computational overhead.
