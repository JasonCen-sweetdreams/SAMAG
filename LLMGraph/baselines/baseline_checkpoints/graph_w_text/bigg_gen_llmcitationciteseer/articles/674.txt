Query expansion is a crucial component of information retrieval systems, as it helps to disambiguate user queries and retrieve relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network-based approach for query expansion, dubbed 'DeepQE'. Our method leverages the semantic relationships between words in the query and the document collection to generate effective expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms traditional query expansion techniques, achieving significant improvements in retrieval performance. We also analyze the impact of different neural network architectures on the query expansion process.
