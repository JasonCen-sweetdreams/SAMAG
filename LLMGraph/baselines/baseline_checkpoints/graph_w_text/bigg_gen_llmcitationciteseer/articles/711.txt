As relational databases continue to grow in size and complexity, distributing data across multiple nodes becomes a crucial scalability strategy. This paper presents a novel data partitioning algorithm, 'Hydra', which leverages a combination of vertical and horizontal partitioning to minimize cross-node communication and optimize query performance. Hydra incorporates a cost-based optimization framework that adaptively adjusts partitioning schemes based on workload characteristics and node availability. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate that Hydra achieves up to 3x improvement in query throughput compared to existing partitioning strategies.
