Chatbots have become ubiquitous in various domains, but their limited emotional expression can lead to user frustration and dissatisfaction. This study explores the impact of emotional expression on user experience in human-chatbot interactions. We designed and evaluated three chatbot prototypes with varying levels of emotional expression, from neutral to empathetic. Our findings suggest that chatbots with empathetic responses led to higher user satisfaction, trust, and perceived emotional support. We also identified cultural differences in user preferences for emotional expression in chatbots. This research contributes to the development of more inclusive and emotionally intelligent chatbots that cater to diverse user needs.
