Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but designing effective conversational agents for VR remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes an embodied conversational agent (ECA) framework that leverages nonverbal cues, emotional intelligence, and personalized feedback to enhance user engagement in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, demonstrating that our ECA approach outperforms traditional chatbots in terms of user satisfaction, emotional arousal, and cognitive load. Our findings have implications for the design of future VR-based systems, including virtual assistants, educational platforms, and social interfaces.
