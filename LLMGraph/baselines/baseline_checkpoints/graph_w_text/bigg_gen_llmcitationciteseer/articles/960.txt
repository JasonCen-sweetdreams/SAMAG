Graph pattern matching is a fundamental operation in numerous data analytics and machine learning applications. However, its computational complexity hinders its adoption in large-scale distributed database systems. This paper proposes a novel indexing technique, called GraphPulse, which accelerates graph pattern matching by pruning unnecessary subgraph exploration. We design a hierarchical index structure that captures structural and attribute-based properties of graph data, allowing for efficient filtering and verification of candidate matches. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphPulse achieves up to 5x speedup over state-of-the-art algorithms while maintaining high accuracy.
