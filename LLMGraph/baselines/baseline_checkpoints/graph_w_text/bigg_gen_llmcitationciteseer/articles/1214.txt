Intelligent traffic signal control is crucial for mitigating urban congestion. This paper presents a novel multi-agent system, 'TRAFFICSYNC', which coordinates heterogeneous agents to optimize real-time traffic signal control. Our approach integrates machine learning-based traffic prediction with decentralized decision-making, enabling agents to adapt to dynamic traffic conditions. We evaluate TRAFFICSYNC in a simulation environment and demonstrate significant reductions in travel time and congestion compared to traditional traffic signal control methods.
