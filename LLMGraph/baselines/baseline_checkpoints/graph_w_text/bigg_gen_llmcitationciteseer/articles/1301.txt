Autonomous agents operating in dynamic environments often require forming coalitions to achieve complex tasks. This paper presents a novel algorithm, 'DCFA', that leverages a combination of distributed constraint satisfaction and graph-based clustering to efficiently form coalitions in real-time. DCFA adapts to changing environmental conditions by iteratively refining the coalition structure, ensuring robustness and scalability. Experimental evaluations on a realistic robotic rescue scenario demonstrate significant improvements in coalition formation speed and task completion rates compared to existing approaches.
