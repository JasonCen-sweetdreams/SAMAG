Dialogue systems involving multiple agents require complex reasoning and context-aware decision-making. This paper presents a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture for explainable multi-agent dialogue systems. Our HAN model captures both local and global dependencies across agents' utterances, allowing for more accurate and interpretable dialogue responses. We introduce a novel attention mechanism, 'AgentAware', which selectively focuses on relevant agents' inputs and provides explicit explanation of the response generation process. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in dialogue coherence and explanation quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
