Faceted search, which enables users to refine their search queries using multiple filters, has become increasingly popular in modern information retrieval systems. However, the existing ranking models struggle to effectively incorporate faceted information, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'FacetNet', which leverages deep neural networks to capture the complex interactions between facets and documents. Our approach learns to represent facets and documents as dense vectors, allowing for efficient and effective ranking of documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that FacetNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of search accuracy and efficiency.
