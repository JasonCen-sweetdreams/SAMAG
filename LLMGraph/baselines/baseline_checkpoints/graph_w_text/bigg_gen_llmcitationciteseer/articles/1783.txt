This paper presents a novel heterogeneous multi-agent framework for real-time traffic optimization. Our approach integrates agent-based modeling with deep reinforcement learning to optimize traffic signal control, route planning, and autonomous vehicle coordination. We propose a hierarchical architecture that combines macro-level traffic management with micro-level agent decision-making, enabling real-time adaptation to dynamic traffic conditions. Experimental results using a large-scale traffic simulator demonstrate significant reductions in congestion, travel time, and emissions compared to traditional optimization methods.
