As data grows in scale and distribution, traditional indexing techniques struggle to maintain query performance in distributed relational databases. This paper proposes an adaptive indexing framework, 'AdapIndex', which dynamically adjusts index structures based on query patterns and data distribution. AdapIndex incorporates a machine learning-based query pattern recognition module to predict query hotspots and optimize index creation accordingly. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database setup show that AdapIndex achieves an average query latency reduction of 35% compared to static indexing techniques.
