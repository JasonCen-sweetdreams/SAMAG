Distributed information retrieval systems require efficient query processing to handle large-scale data and high query loads. This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing approach, combining the benefits of term-based and document-based indexing. Our method, called HyIx, uses a hierarchical index structure to facilitate fast query routing and reduce network communication costs. Experimental results on a large-scale document collection demonstrate that HyIx outperforms existing indexing techniques, achieving up to 30% improvement in query response time and 25% reduction in network bandwidth usage.
