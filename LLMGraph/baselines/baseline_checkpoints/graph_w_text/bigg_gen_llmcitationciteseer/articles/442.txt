Modern analytical workloads often rely on distributed column-stores to process massive datasets. However, maintaining secondary indexes in these systems becomes increasingly challenging due to the high volume of updates and the need for concurrent query execution. This paper presents 'DynaIndex', a novel approach to efficient secondary index maintenance in distributed column-stores. DynaIndex employs a hybrid indexing technique that combines trie-based and bitmap-based indexing, allowing for adaptive index reorganization and minimized index maintenance overhead. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DynaIndex reduces index maintenance time by up to 70% compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining query performance and scalability.
