Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular due to their ability to handle large-scale data and high-workload applications. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize query execution plans in DDS. We design an RL agent that learns to select the optimal query plan based on the system's workload and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques, achieving an average query response time reduction of 30%.
