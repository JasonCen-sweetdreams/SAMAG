Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly popular, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the role of personalized avatars in enhancing user experience in VR environments. We designed and implemented a VR platform that incorporates machine learning-based avatar generation, allowing users to create personalized avatars that reflect their physical appearance and personality traits. A user study involving 120 participants revealed that personalized avatars significantly increased user engagement, as measured by time spent in the VR environment and self-reported satisfaction. Our findings have implications for the design of future VR systems and applications.
