Conversational interfaces have become increasingly prevalent, but their accessibility for older adults with cognitive impairments remains a significant concern. This paper presents a user-centered design approach to develop an accessible conversational interface tailored to the needs of this population. We conducted a series of interviews and usability studies to identify key design requirements, including simplified language, visual cues, and error tolerance. Our proposed interface, 'CARE', incorporates these features and was evaluated in a pilot study with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments, demonstrating significant improvements in task completion rate and user satisfaction.
