 Passage retrieval is a crucial component of open-domain question answering systems. However, the effectiveness of passage retrieval algorithms is often hindered by the vocabulary mismatch between the query and relevant passages. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages neural document embeddings to capture the semantic relationships between terms. NeuroQE uses a dense passage retrieval model to generate a set of relevant passages, and then applies a neural-based query expansion technique to expand the query. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that NeuroQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 12% improvement in terms of passage retrieval accuracy.
