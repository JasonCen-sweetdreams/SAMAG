Real-time analytics on large-scale datasets has become increasingly important in various domains. Distributed column stores (DCS) have emerged as a popular architecture for storing and processing big data. However, query optimization for DCS remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'ColOpt', which leverages machine learning and column-store specific features to optimize query plans. We introduce a hybrid cost model that combines traditional query optimization techniques with machine learning-based predictions of query execution times. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that ColOpt outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 3x in terms of query execution time.
