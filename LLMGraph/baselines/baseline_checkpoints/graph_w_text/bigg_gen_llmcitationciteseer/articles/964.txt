The growing adoption of RDF data has created a need for efficient query processing techniques. This paper presents a novel graph-based indexing approach, called GRIN, which leverages the structural properties of RDF graphs to accelerate query execution. GRIN constructs a hierarchical index that captures the relationships between RDF triples, enabling efficient query routing and optimization. Our experiments on real-world RDF datasets demonstrate that GRIN outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving up to 3x speedup in query response time and 2x reduction in memory usage.
