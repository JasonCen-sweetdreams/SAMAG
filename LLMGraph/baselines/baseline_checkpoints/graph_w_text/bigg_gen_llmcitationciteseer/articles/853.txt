Distributed databases are increasingly used in modern applications, but range query processing remains a performance bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical indexing technique, 'HiRI', which partitions the data space into multiple levels of granularity. By leveraging a combination of Bloom filters and space-filling curves, HiRI enables fast and efficient range query processing with reduced network communication overhead. Experimental evaluations on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HiRI outperforms existing indexing methods by up to 3x in terms of query latency and 2x in terms of data transfer.
