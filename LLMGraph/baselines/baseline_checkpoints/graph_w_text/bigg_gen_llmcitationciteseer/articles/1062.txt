As cloud-based database systems continue to scale, query response time becomes a critical performance bottleneck. This paper presents an adaptive index structure, called 'AIx', which dynamically adjusts to changing query patterns and data distributions. AIx integrates machine learning-based prediction models with traditional B-tree indexing, enabling efficient query routing and minimizing unnecessary index maintenance. Our experimental evaluation on a cloud-based DBMS demonstrates that AIx reduces average query response time by up to 35% compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques, while maintaining comparable storage overhead.
