Deep learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, but the robustness against real-world noises remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates the performance of various deep learning architectures under different types of real-world noises, such as Gaussian noise, speckle noise, and salt-and-pepper noise. We propose a novel evaluation framework, 'NoiseRobust', which simulates real-world noise distributions and evaluates model robustness using a set of metrics. Our experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets reveal that state-of-the-art models are more susceptible to real-world noises than previously thought, and we provide insights into the design of more robust models.
