Ad-hoc search systems rely on efficient retrieval mechanisms to provide relevant results. This paper introduces a novel approach, Query-Aware Document Embeddings (QuADE), which leverages query information to generate dense vector representations of documents. By incorporating query-dependent contextualization, QuADE improves the precision of document ranking and reduces the computational overhead of traditional retrieval methods. Our experiments on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate a significant reduction in mean average precision error and improved retrieval efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
