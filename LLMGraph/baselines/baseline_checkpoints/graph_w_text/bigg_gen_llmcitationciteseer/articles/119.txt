Industrial IoT sensor data is prone to anomalies that can cause significant downtime and economic losses. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'AnoTS', for time-series anomaly detection in industrial IoT sensor data. AnoTS leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks to model complex temporal dependencies and patterns in sensor data. We evaluate AnoTS on a real-world dataset from a manufacturing plant and demonstrate its superior performance compared to traditional statistical methods and machine learning approaches. The proposed approach can be easily integrated into existing industrial IoT systems, enabling real-time anomaly detection and predictive maintenance.
