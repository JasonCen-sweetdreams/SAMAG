Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing. However, optimizing queries in such systems remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. Our method, called QOPT-RL, leverages a deep Q-network to learn an optimal query plan policy. We evaluate QOPT-RL on several benchmarks and demonstrate significant improvements in query execution time and resource utilization compared to traditional optimization techniques. Our experiments also show that QOPT-RL adapts well to changing database workloads and scales to large distributed systems.
