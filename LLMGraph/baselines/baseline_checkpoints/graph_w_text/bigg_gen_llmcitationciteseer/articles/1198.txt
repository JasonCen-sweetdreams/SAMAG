In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a crucial problem that affects overall system performance. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework based on evolutionary game theory, which enables agents to adapt to changing environments and optimize their task assignments. Our approach, called 'Evo Alloc', uses a genetic algorithm to evolve agent strategies that balance individual utility with global system efficiency. We evaluate Evo Alloc on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate its ability to outperform traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of response time and resource utilization.
