Conversational interfaces have become ubiquitous, but their design often neglects the needs of older adults, who may face cognitive, sensory, and motor impairments. This paper presents a multimodal approach to designing inclusive conversational interfaces for older adults, incorporating speech, gesture, and gaze-based input modalities. We conducted a user study with 30 older adults, evaluating the effectiveness of our approach in reducing cognitive load, improving user experience, and enhancing accessibility. Our results show significant benefits in usability, user satisfaction, and accessibility metrics, demonstrating the potential of multimodal conversational interfaces to support older adults' independence and well-being.
