Column-store databases have become increasingly popular for analytical workloads, but their indexing mechanisms often fail to efficiently support real-time aggregate queries. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'RapidAgg', which leverages a combination of bitmapped indexing, late materialization, and adaptive sampling to accelerate aggregate queries. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RapidAgg outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods by up to 5x, while ensuring low storage overhead and minimal maintenance costs.
