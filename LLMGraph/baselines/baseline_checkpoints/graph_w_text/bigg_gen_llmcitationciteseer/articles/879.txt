Multi-tenant database systems require efficient query optimization to minimize resource contention and improve overall system performance. This paper presents GraphOpt, a novel query optimization framework that leverages graph-based indexing to identify optimal query plans. GraphOpt constructs a graph representation of the query workload and uses community detection algorithms to identify subgraphs with similar query patterns. Experimental results on a real-world multi-tenant database system demonstrate that GraphOpt reduces query latency by up to 35% and improves system throughput by up to 25% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
