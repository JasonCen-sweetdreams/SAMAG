In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper proposes a novel approach using graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn autonomous task allocation policies. Our method, 'GNN-ATA', represents the agent-task graph as a learnable embedding space, enabling the agents to reason about task dependencies and allocate tasks optimally. Experimental results on a simulated robotics scenario demonstrate that GNN-ATA outperforms traditional heuristic-based methods in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
