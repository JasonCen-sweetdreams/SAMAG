Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval systems, but traditional methods often rely on handcrafted rules and fail to capture complex semantic relationships. This paper explores the application of deep neural networks to query expansion, proposing a novel architecture that jointly learns to identify relevant expansion terms and predict their weights. Our approach, dubbed 'DeepQE', leverages a combination of convolutional and recurrent layers to model the context-aware representation of queries and documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that DeepQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 12% increase in mean average precision.
