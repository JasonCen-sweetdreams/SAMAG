Few-shot image classification remains a challenging problem in machine learning. Existing meta-learning approaches often rely on fixed metric spaces, which may not generalize well to novel tasks. This paper proposes a novel task-aware adaptive metric meta-learning framework, 'TAMM', which learns to adapt the metric space to each task. TAMM employs a neural network-based metric adapter that takes task embeddings as input and outputs a task-specific metric. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAMM on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on few-shot image classification tasks. Furthermore, we show that TAMM can generalize to unseen tasks with limited labeled data.
