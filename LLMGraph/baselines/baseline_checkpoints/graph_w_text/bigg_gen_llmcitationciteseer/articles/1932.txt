Medical document retrieval is a challenging task due to the ambiguity of medical terms and the complexity of medical concepts. This paper proposes a novel query expansion method using deep neural networks to improve the retrieval performance of medical documents. Our approach leverages a pre-trained language model to generate a set of expansion terms that capture the semantic meaning of the original query. We evaluate our method on a benchmark dataset of medical articles and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall compared to traditional query expansion techniques.
