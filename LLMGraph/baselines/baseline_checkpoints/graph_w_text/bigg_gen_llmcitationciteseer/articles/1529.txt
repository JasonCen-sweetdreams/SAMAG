In multi-agent systems, task allocation is a complex problem that requires efficient cooperation among agents to achieve common goals. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, 'CATALYST', which enables agents to learn cooperative task allocation policies in decentralized and dynamic environments. Our approach combines graph neural networks with multi-agent Q-learning to enable agents to reason about task dependencies and allocate tasks effectively. Experimental results on a variety of task allocation domains demonstrate that CATALYST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion rate, agent utilization, and adaptability to changing task requirements.
