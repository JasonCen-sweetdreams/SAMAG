Voice assistants have become increasingly popular, but their usability for older adults remains a concern. This study investigates the impact of cognitive load on the intentionality of older adults when interacting with voice assistants. We designed an experiment where participants completed tasks with varying levels of complexity while using a custom-built voice assistant. Our results show that older adults experience higher cognitive load when interacting with voice assistants, leading to decreased intentionality. We propose a set of design guidelines to mitigate this effect, including simplifying language, reducing ambiguity, and providing explicit feedback. Our findings have implications for the design of inclusive voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults.
