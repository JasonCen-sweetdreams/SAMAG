The increasing popularity of multi-modal data, such as images, videos, and sensors, has led to the development of specialized database systems. However, query optimization in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'MultiOpt', that leverages the characteristics of multi-modal data to reduce query execution time. We propose a cost-based optimization approach that incorporates domain-specific knowledge and exploits the parallel processing capabilities of modern hardware. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that MultiOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3x, making it an attractive solution for large-scale multi-modal database systems.
