With the increasing popularity of RDF graph databases, query optimization becomes a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel query optimization framework, 'RDF-Optimizer', specifically designed for distributed RDF graph databases. RDF-Optimizer leverages a combination of graph partitioning, subquery rewriting, and parallel execution to significantly reduce query response times. We evaluate RDF-Optimizer on a real-world dataset and demonstrate an average speedup of 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art query optimizers.
