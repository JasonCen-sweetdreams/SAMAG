Conversational AI systems often struggle to adapt to varying user preferences and dialogue contexts. This paper presents a meta-learning approach to dialogue management, where a neural network learns to update its parameters in response to user feedback. Our proposed method, 'AdaDialog', leverages model-agnostic meta-learning to quickly adapt to new dialogue scenarios, achieving improved response quality and user satisfaction. We evaluate AdaDialog on a range of conversational datasets, demonstrating its ability to generalize across different domains and dialogue styles.
