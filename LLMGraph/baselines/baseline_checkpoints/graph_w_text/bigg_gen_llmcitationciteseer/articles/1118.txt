Distributed relational databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data processing tasks. However, optimizing query execution plans in these systems remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for distributed relational databases. We design a reinforcement learning framework that learns to select the optimal execution plan by interacting with the database environment and receiving rewards based on query performance. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
