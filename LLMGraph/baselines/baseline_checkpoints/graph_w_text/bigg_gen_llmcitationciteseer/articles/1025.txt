Distributed databases have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and processing. However, optimizing query performance in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages machine learning to select the most effective index for a given query. Our method, called 'IndexOpt', uses a combination of query features and database characteristics to train a neural network that predicts the optimal index. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database show that IndexOpt outperforms traditional indexing techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
