In complex multi-agent systems, coordinating task allocation is crucial for efficient performance. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning framework, 'MADRL', which learns to allocate tasks dynamically based on agent capabilities, task priorities, and environmental constraints. We utilize a decentralized actor-critic architecture, where each agent learns to optimize its local policy while communicating with neighbors to achieve global coordination. Experimental results on a realistic disaster response scenario demonstrate that MADRL outperforms traditional planning-based approaches in terms of task completion time and resource utilization.
