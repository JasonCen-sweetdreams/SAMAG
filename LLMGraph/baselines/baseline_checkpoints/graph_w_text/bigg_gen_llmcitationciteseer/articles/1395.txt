Query expansion is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, as it can significantly impact the retrieval performance. Traditional query expansion methods rely on hand-crafted features and statistical techniques, which may not capture the nuanced semantic relationships between terms. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'SEMEX', which leverages semantic embeddings to learn dense representations of query terms and documents. Our method integrates a neural query expansion module with a ranking model, allowing for end-to-end training and optimization. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEMEX outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
