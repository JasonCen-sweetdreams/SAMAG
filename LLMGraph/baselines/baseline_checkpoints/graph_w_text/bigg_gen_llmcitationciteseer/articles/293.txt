The advent of modern storage devices, such as flash and hybrid storage systems, has transformed the landscape of query processing. However, traditional indexing techniques are often inefficient or ineffective in these environments. This paper presents a novel indexing strategy, 'FlexIndex', designed specifically for multi-dimensional range queries on modern storage devices. FlexIndex leverages the inherent characteristics of these devices to achieve significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art indexing techniques. Our experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that FlexIndex reduces query latency by up to 70% and improves throughput by a factor of 3.
