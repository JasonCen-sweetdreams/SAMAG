Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in disease diagnosis, but their lack of interpretability hinders trust and adoption in high-stakes medical applications. This paper proposes a hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that integrates medical knowledge graphs and electronic health records to provide explainable AI-powered disease diagnosis. HGAT uses attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant graph neighborhoods and clinical features, generating interpretable disease association graphs and feature importance scores. Experimental results on a large-scale disease diagnosis dataset demonstrate improved accuracy and explainability compared to existing deep learning models.
