Anomaly detection in time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper introduces a novel graph-based contrastive learning framework, 'GraphCon', which leverages the structural properties of time series data to identify anomalies. By constructing a graph from time series segments and applying contrastive learning, GraphCon learns to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that GraphCon outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
