As modern databases face increasingly large and diverse workloads, scalability becomes a critical concern. This paper presents 'ElasticDB', a novel approach to elastic database scalability that leverages automated schema refactoring. ElasticDB dynamically analyzes query patterns and adapts the database schema to optimize performance, reducing latency by up to 60% in our experiments. Our approach integrates with popular relational databases and is compatible with existing query optimization techniques. We demonstrate ElasticDB's effectiveness on a real-world e-commerce dataset, showcasing its potential to improve responsiveness and reduce costs in cloud-based database deployments.
