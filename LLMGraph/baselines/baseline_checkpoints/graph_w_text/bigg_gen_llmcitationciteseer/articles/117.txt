Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success in node classification tasks. However, existing methods often struggle with multi-label classification, where nodes can belong to multiple classes. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages label correlations to improve multi-label node classification. HGAT consists of multiple attention layers that aggregate features from neighboring nodes and labels, enabling the model to capture complex label relationships. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs in terms of macro-F1 score and label ranking metrics.
