Voice assistants have the potential to improve the lives of older adults with cognitive impairments, but existing systems often lack accessibility features tailored to their needs. This paper presents 'EasyVoice', a novel voice assistant framework that incorporates cognitive support mechanisms, such as semantic chunking, error correction, and personalized feedback. We conducted a usability study with 20 older adults with cognitive impairments and found that EasyVoice significantly improved their ability to complete tasks and reported higher user satisfaction compared to a commercial voice assistant. Our findings highlight the importance of inclusive design in HCI and provide insights for future development of accessible voice assistants.
