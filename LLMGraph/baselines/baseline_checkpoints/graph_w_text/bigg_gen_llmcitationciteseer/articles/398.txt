This paper explores the potential of AI-driven sketching tools in facilitating co-creative design processes between humans and machines. We present 'Sketch Buddy', a novel system that leverages generative adversarial networks (GANs) to assist designers in generating and refining 2D sketches. Our user study with 20 professional designers reveals that Sketch Buddy enhances design quality, reduces cognitive load, and fosters more effective collaboration. We also identify key factors influencing human-AI collaboration, including trust, communication, and feedback mechanisms. Our findings have implications for the development of more effective AI-driven design tools that support human-centered design processes.
