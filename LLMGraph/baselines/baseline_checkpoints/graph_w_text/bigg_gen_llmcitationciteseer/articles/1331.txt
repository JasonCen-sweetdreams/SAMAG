Traditional indexing techniques in main-memory databases can lead to suboptimal query performance due to the complexity of modern query workloads. This paper proposes a novel approach to indexing, dubbed 'Lix', which leverages machine learning to learn adaptive index structures that optimize query execution. Our method uses a neural network to predict the optimal index configuration based on the query workload, and adaptively reconfigures the index as the workload evolves. Experimental results on a real-world database show that Lix achieves an average query speedup of 2.5x compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques, while reducing memory overhead by 30%.
