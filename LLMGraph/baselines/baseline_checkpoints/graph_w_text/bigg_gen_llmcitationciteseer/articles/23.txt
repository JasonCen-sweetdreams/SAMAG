Query optimization is a crucial component of distributed database systems, as it significantly impacts the performance of complex queries. Traditional optimization techniques rely on hand-crafted heuristics or rule-based systems, which may not adapt well to diverse workload characteristics. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQOpt', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize query plans in distributed settings. By modeling the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process, we train a neural network to learn optimal query plans that minimize execution time and resource utilization. Experimental results on the TPC-DS benchmark demonstrate that DeepQOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
