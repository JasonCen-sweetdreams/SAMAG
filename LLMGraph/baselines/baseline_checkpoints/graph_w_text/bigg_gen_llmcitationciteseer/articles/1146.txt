Traditional keyword-based indexing methods for document retrieval often fail to capture the semantic relationships between phrases, leading to suboptimal query performance. We propose a novel hierarchical phrase-based indexing approach, dubbed 'PhraseTree', which leverages phrase embeddings to construct a tree-like index structure. PhraseTree enables efficient retrieval of documents by exploiting phrase co-occurrence patterns and reducing the dimensionality of the query space. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that PhraseTree outperforms state-of-the-art keyword-based indexing methods in terms of both query latency and retrieval accuracy.
