Multi-agent cooperative reinforcement learning has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in applications such as autonomous vehicles and swarm robotics. However, existing methods often struggle to scale to large numbers of agents and complex environment dynamics. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) architecture, which models agent interactions at multiple scales and incorporates attention mechanisms to focus on critical relationships. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT in various cooperative tasks, including predator-prey pursuit and resource allocation, and show improved performance and sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
