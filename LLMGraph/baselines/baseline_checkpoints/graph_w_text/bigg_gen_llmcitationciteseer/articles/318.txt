Neural retrieval models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various information retrieval tasks. However, they often rely on exact term matching, neglecting the contextual relationships between query terms. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'ConEx', which leverages context-aware embeddings to capture the semantic nuances of query terms. Our method adaptively selects expansion terms based on their contextual similarity to the original query, resulting in improved retrieval accuracy and robustness. Experimental evaluations on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ConEx in enhancing the performance of neural retrieval models.
