Query expansion is a crucial step in search engine retrieval, as it enables the system to capture the user's intent more accurately. However, existing approaches often struggle with entity disambiguation, leading to suboptimal expansion results. This paper proposes a novel neural entity disambiguation framework, 'NeuroDis', which leverages contextualized embeddings and graph-based attention to resolve entity ambiguities. We integrate NeuroDis with a state-of-the-art query expansion model, demonstrating significant improvements in retrieval performance on a benchmark dataset. Our approach outperforms traditional entity disambiguation methods, especially in cases where entity mentions are ambiguous or have limited context.
