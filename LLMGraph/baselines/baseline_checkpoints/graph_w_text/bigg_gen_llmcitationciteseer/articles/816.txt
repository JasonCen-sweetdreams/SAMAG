As robots become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, effective human-robot collaboration is crucial. This paper investigates the role of embodiment in virtual environments on human-robot collaboration. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, who interacted with a robot in a virtual environment with varying levels of embodiment. Our results show that increased embodiment leads to improved collaboration outcomes, including reduced task completion time and increased user satisfaction. We also found that users' perceived trust in the robot and their sense of presence in the virtual environment are significant predictors of collaboration success. The implications of our findings for the design of virtual human-robot collaboration systems are discussed.
