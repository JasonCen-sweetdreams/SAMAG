Virtual reality (VR) avatars have the potential to revolutionize human-computer interaction, but their design and implementation can significantly impact user experience. This paper presents an empirical study investigating the effects of embodiment and agency on user engagement and presence in VR environments. We develop a novel framework for evaluating avatar design, incorporating metrics for anthropomorphism, autonomy, and feedback. Our results show that avatars with higher embodiment and agency lead to increased user satisfaction and immersion, while also influencing user behavior and decision-making. The findings have implications for the design of VR systems in various domains, including gaming, education, and healthcare.
