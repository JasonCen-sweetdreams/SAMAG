With the increasing adoption of heterogeneous storage systems in distributed databases, query optimization has become a critical challenge. Existing solutions either neglect storage heterogeneity or rely on naive and inefficient optimization techniques. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'HeteOpt', which leverages statistical models and machine learning algorithms to adapt to diverse storage configurations. HeteOpt introduces a cost-based optimization approach that considers storage characteristics, query patterns, and system workload to minimize query execution time. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that HeteOpt achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
