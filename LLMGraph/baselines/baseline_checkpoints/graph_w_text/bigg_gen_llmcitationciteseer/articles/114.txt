Traditional document retrieval techniques rely on bag-of-words representations and simple ranking functions. This paper presents a neural ranking model, QRex, that leverages query expansion and contextualized embeddings to improve retrieval performance. QRex uses a transformer-based architecture to encode queries and documents, and incorporates a query expansion module to capture relevant keywords and phrases. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that QRex outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval models, including BM25 and neural IR baselines, in terms of NDCG@10 and MAP.
