This paper presents an innovative approach to user feedback in virtual reality (VR) environments, leveraging affective avatars to convey emotions and enhance user engagement. Our system, 'EmoAvatar', employs machine learning-based emotion recognition to generate personalized, empathetic responses from the avatar, fostering a sense of social presence and rapport-building. A user study with 30 participants demonstrates that EmoAvatar significantly improves user satisfaction, self-reported emotional connection, and task performance in a VR-based learning scenario, compared to traditional, text-based feedback methods.
