This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'QRank', that leverages query-document interaction to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of document ranking in information retrieval. QRank employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture fine-grained semantic relationships between query terms and document passages. We also introduce a novel training objective that combines both pointwise and pairwise losses to optimize ranking performance. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that QRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models while reducing computational overhead by up to 30%.
