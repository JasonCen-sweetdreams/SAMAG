Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is a promising treatment for anxiety disorders, but patient engagement and comfort remain significant challenges. This study investigates the role of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) in enhancing the therapeutic experience in VRET. We designed and tested an ECA-based VRET system, where a virtual therapist guides patients through exposure exercises. Our user study with 30 participants shows that the ECA condition resulted in significantly lower anxiety levels and higher self-reported comfort compared to a text-based interface. We also found that the ECA's emotional expressions and empathetic responses positively correlated with patient engagement and satisfaction.
