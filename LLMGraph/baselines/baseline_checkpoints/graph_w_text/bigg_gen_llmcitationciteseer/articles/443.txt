Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, where query expansion techniques are often employed to improve the retrieval performance. This paper propose a novel query expansion approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages the power of deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. Our approach utilizes a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion and retrieval tasks. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.
