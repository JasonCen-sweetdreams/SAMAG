As graph databases continue to grow in scale and complexity, supporting real-time analytics has become a significant challenge. This paper presents 'GraphAce', a novel query optimization framework designed for distributed graph databases. GraphAce leverages a combination of graph summarization, query rewriting, and adaptive caching to minimize latency and improve throughput. Experimental evaluations on a cluster of 16 nodes demonstrate that GraphAce outperforms existing query optimization techniques by up to 3.5x for complex graph queries, while maintaining high accuracy and scalability.
