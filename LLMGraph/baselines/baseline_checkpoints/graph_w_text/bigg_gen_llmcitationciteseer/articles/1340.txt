This paper explores the role of embodied cognition in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) within Virtual Reality (VR) environments. We conducted a user study to investigate how bodily sensations and motor experiences influence user behavior and performance in VR. Our results show that incorporating embodied cognition principles in VR interface design can significantly enhance user engagement, spatial awareness, and task completion times. We propose a novel framework for designing embodied VR interfaces and discuss the implications for future HCI research in VR.
