Neural information retrieval (IR) models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in various search tasks. However, their effectiveness often relies on the quality of the input documents. This paper proposes a novel relevance-based document expansion approach, 'DocExp', which leverages a neural ranking model to selectively expand the original document with relevant passages from a large external corpus. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism to weigh the importance of expanded passages and integrate them with the original document representation. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that DocExp significantly improves the retrieval performance of neural IR models, especially for short and ambiguous queries.
