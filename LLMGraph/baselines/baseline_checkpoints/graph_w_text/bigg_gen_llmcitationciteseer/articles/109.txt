Ad-hoc search engines struggle to retrieve relevant documents when user queries are ambiguous or contain nuanced intent. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'QueryRefine', which reformulates queries by modeling their semantic context. QueryRefine leverages a transformer-based architecture to generate a set of refined queries that better capture the user's information need. We evaluate our approach on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance, particularly for queries with low frequency terms or implicit intent. Our results show that QueryRefine can be easily integrated with existing search engines to enhance their retrieval capabilities.
