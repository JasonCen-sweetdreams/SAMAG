The increasing adoption of multi-core architectures in database systems has created new opportunities for query optimization. However, traditional optimization techniques often fail to fully utilize the available processing resources. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for multi-core architectures. Our method, called 'CoreOpt', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal query plan for a given workload and hardware configuration. Experimental results on a real-world database benchmark show that CoreOpt outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques by up to 3.5x in terms of query execution time.
