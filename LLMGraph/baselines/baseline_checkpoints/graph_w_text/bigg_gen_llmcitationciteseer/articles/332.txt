The proliferation of IoT devices and financial applications has led to an explosion in time-series data, necessitating efficient indexing techniques for real-time querying. This paper presents 'TS-Index', a novel indexing framework designed for main-memory database systems. TS-Index leverages a combination of hierarchical clustering and approximate query processing to achieve sub-millisecond query response times while maintaining low memory overhead. Our experiments on a 10TB synthetic dataset demonstrate that TS-Index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 5x in terms of query performance, making it an attractive solution for real-time analytics workloads.
