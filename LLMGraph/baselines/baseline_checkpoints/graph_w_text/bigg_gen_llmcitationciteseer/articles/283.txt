Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize various industries, but user engagement remains a significant challenge. This study explores the impact of personalized haptic feedback on user experience and immersion in VR environments. We designed a novel haptic feedback system that adapts to individual users' preferences and tactile sensitivity, and evaluated its effectiveness in a controlled experiment. Our results show that personalized haptic feedback significantly enhances user engagement, presence, and enjoyment in VR, particularly for users with higher tactile sensitivity. The findings have implications for the design of more effective and engaging VR interfaces.
