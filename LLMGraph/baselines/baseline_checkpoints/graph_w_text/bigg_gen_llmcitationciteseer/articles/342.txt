The proliferation of IoT devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation strategies. This paper introduces 'ARA', a scalable agent-based framework that dynamically allocates resources in IoT environments. ARA leverages a multi-agent system to model the interactions between devices and resources, and employs a novel auction-based mechanism to optimize resource allocation. We evaluate ARA through simulations and experiments on a real-world IoT testbed, demonstrating significant improvements in resource utilization and device satisfaction compared to traditional centralized approaches.
