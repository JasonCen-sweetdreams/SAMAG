Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern homes, but their usability for older adults remains a concern. This study investigates the challenges faced by older adults when interacting with voice assistants, focusing on speech recognition errors and recovery strategies. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 older adults, using a custom-built voice assistant and a think-aloud protocol. Our results show that older adults experience higher error rates due to speech patterns, cognitive load, and lack of feedback. We propose a set of design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants, including personalized speech recognition models, multimodal feedback, and error recovery mechanisms. Our findings have implications for designing accessible and supportive voice assistants for older adults.
