Semantic search in unstructured data often relies on query expansion to improve retrieval accuracy. However, existing methods struggle to balance query scope and computational efficiency. This paper presents a novel exhaustive query expansion (EQE) approach, which leverages hierarchical semantic indexing and probabilistic query modeling to generate a comprehensive set of candidate queries. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that EQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art expansion methods, achieving up to 25% improvement in mean average precision while reducing computational overhead by 30%
