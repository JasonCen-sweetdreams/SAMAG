Coordinating multiple agents to perform cooperative tasks in dynamic environments is a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach, called Cooperative Task Allocation (CTA), which enables agents to adapt to changing environmental conditions and allocate tasks efficiently. CTA uses a decentralized, graph-based representation to model agent interactions and incorporates a reward function that balances individual and collective performance. Experimental results in a simulated robotic search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that CTA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task completion time and agent coordination.
