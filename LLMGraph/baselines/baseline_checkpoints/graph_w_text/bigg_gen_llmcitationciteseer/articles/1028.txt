Older adults with motor impairments face significant barriers when interacting with gestural interfaces. This paper presents a novel design framework that integrates accessibility principles with machine learning-based gesture recognition. We conducted a participatory design study with 20 older adults, resulting in a set of inclusive design recommendations for gesture sets, feedback mechanisms, and adaptive difficulty adjustment. Our prototype, 'EasyGesture', was evaluated in a controlled experiment, showing significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to existing gestural interfaces. The proposed framework has implications for designing more accessible and usable interfaces for older adults with motor impairments.
