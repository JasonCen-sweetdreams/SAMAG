The increasing adoption of non-volatile memory (NVM) in modern storage systems has led to a surge in column-store databases. However, existing indexing techniques are inadequate for NVM-based column stores, resulting in poor query performance. This paper presents 'NVMI', a novel indexing framework that leverages the unique characteristics of NVM to optimize query execution. We propose a hybrid indexing approach that combines a cache-friendly layout with a novel compression scheme, achieving an average query speedup of 3.2x over state-of-the-art indexing methods. Experimental results on a real-world analytical workload demonstrate the efficacy of NVMI in reducing query latency and improving overall system performance.
