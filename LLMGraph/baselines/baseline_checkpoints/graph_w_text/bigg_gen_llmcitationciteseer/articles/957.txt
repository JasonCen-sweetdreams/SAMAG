In multi-agent systems, allocating tasks efficiently is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical task allocation framework, 'HTA-DRL', which leverages deep reinforcement learning to learn effective task assignment policies. HTA-DRL consists of two hierarchical layers: a high-level layer that allocates tasks to agent groups, and a low-level layer that assigns tasks to individual agents within each group. We evaluate HTA-DRL on a variety of task allocation scenarios and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion time and resource utilization compared to existing approaches.
