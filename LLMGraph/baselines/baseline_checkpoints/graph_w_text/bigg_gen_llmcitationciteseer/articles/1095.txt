Large-scale multi-agent systems (MAS) pose significant challenges in terms of agent communication, coordination, and scalability. This paper presents a novel decentralized communication framework, 'DAEMON', which enables efficient and adaptive information exchange among agents in MAS. DAEMON leverages a hybrid approach combining gossip protocols with distributed hash tables to facilitate robust and fault-tolerant communication. We evaluate DAEMON through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved communication latency, reduced message overhead, and enhanced system resilience compared to existing decentralized communication schemes.
