Information retrieval systems rely on accurate document ranking to retrieve relevant results. This paper proposes a novel approach to document ranking using hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs). Our method represents documents as graphs, capturing semantic relationships between entities and keywords. A hierarchical attention mechanism is employed to learn node representations at multiple scales, enabling the model to capture both local and global context. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving significant improvements in terms of mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
