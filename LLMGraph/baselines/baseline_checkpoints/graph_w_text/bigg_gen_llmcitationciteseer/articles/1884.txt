Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, but existing methods often lack interpretability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach, called 'HierAno', which detects anomalies while providing insights into their underlying causes. HierAno leverages a multi-resolution representation of time-series data, enabling the identification of anomalies at multiple scales. We introduce a novel metric, 'Explainability Score', to quantify the interpretability of detected anomalies. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that HierAno outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both detection accuracy and explainability.
