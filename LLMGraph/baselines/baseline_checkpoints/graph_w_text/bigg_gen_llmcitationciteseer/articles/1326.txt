Neural search engines have shown promising results in various information retrieval tasks. However, they often struggle with query ambiguity and limited contextual understanding. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages context-aware term embeddings to improve the retrieval performance. Our approach incorporates a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture both local and global context, enabling the model to better disambiguate query terms and identify relevant documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval precision and recall compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
