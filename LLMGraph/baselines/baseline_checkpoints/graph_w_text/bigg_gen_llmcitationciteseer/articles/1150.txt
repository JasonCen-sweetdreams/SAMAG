In complex multi-agent systems, finding efficient paths while avoiding collisions remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel algorithm, Adaptive Hierarchical Clustering for Multi-Agent Pathfinding (AHC-MAP), which leverages a hierarchical clustering approach to reduce the dimensionality of the search space. Our method adaptively adjusts the clustering granularity based on the agents' proximity and velocity, allowing for real-time path planning in large-scale scenarios. Experimental results on simulated urban environments demonstrate significant improvements in computational efficiency and collision avoidance rates compared to state-of-the-art methods.
