Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have shown promise in healthcare communication, but their design often neglects the needs of marginalized populations. This paper presents a framework for designing inclusive ECAs that accommodate diverse abilities, languages, and cultural backgrounds. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 120 participants from underrepresented groups, revealing key design principles for ECAs that promote trust, understanding, and empathy. Our findings inform the development of a novel ECA prototype, 'HealthPal', which demonstrates improved user engagement and satisfaction in healthcare consultations.
