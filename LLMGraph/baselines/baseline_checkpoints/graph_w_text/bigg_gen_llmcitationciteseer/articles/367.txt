The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has created new opportunities for decentralized task allocation. However, existing approaches often rely on centralized control or simplistic heuristics, leading to suboptimal performance and limited scalability. This paper presents a novel framework for autonomous agent coalition formation, enabling decentralized task allocation in IoT networks. Our approach leverages multi-agent systems and distributed constraint optimization to facilitate the formation of coalitions that maximize utility while respecting resource constraints. Experimental results demonstrate improved task allocation efficiency and robustness in simulated IoT scenarios.
