Traditional information retrieval models often rely on simplistic term-frequency representations, neglecting the rich semantic relationships between documents. This paper presents a novel approach to personalized document ranking using Hierarchical Graph Attention Networks (HGAT). HGAT leverages document graphs to model complex relationships between entities, and incorporates user preferences through attention-based neural networks. Our experiments on a large-scale web search dataset demonstrate significant improvements in ranking accuracy and user satisfaction compared to state-of-the-art models, particularly for long-tail queries. We also show that HGAT can effectively generalize to new users and documents, making it a promising solution for large-scale IR systems.
