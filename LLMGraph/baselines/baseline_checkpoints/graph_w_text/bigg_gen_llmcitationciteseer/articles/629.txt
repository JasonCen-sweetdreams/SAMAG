This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model for ad-hoc retrieval, called HierAttRank. Our approach leverages a hierarchical document representation, combining local and global contextualized embeddings. A key innovation is the incorporation of query-aware attention, which selectively focuses on relevant document segments based on the query's semantic content. Experimental results on several benchmark collections demonstrate that HierAttRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, particularly in scenarios with long documents and complex queries. We also provide empirical insights into the benefits of hierarchical representations and query-aware attention for ad-hoc retrieval tasks.
