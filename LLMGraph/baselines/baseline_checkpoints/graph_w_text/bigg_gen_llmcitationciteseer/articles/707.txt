Conversational interfaces are increasingly prevalent, but their design often neglects the needs of people with dyslexia. This paper presents a human-centered approach to creating accessible conversational interfaces for individuals with dyslexia. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving user interviews, cognitive walkthroughs, and usability testing to identify key design challenges and opportunities. Our findings inform the development of a set of design guidelines and a proof-of-concept interface that incorporates dyslexia-friendly features, such as text-to-speech, font customization, and error forgiveness. Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in user experience and task completion rates for participants with dyslexia.
