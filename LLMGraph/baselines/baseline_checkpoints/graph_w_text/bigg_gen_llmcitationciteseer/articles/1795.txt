Expert search systems are critical in various domains, including academia and industry, where retrieving documents authored by specific experts is essential. This paper presents a novel hierarchical neural ranking model, HierRank, which leverages the hierarchical structure of expert profiles to improve document retrieval efficiency. Our approach combines a neural document encoder with a hierarchical attention mechanism to capture the relationships between experts, documents, and topics. Experimental results on a large-scale expert search dataset demonstrate that HierRank outperforms state-of-the-art ranking models in terms of retrieval accuracy and efficiency.
