Gaussian process regression (GPR) is a powerful tool for time series forecasting, but its cubic computational complexity limits its applicability to high-dimensional datasets. This paper presents 'HiTS', a scalable GPR framework that leverages a novel sparse covariance matrix approximation and a parallelized inference algorithm. We demonstrate HiTS's efficacy on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance and orders-of-magnitude speedup over existing GPR methods. Our approach enables accurate and efficient forecasting of high-dimensional time series data, with applications in areas such as finance, climate modeling, and healthcare.
