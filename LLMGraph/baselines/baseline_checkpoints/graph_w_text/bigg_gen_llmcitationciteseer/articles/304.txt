Graph databases have become ubiquitous in modern data management, but querying large graphs remains a significant performance bottleneck. This paper presents a novel approach to optimize graph queries by leveraging subgraph isomorphism. We propose a hierarchical indexing scheme that efficiently identifies candidate subgraphs, reducing the search space for isomorphism checks. Experimental evaluation on real-world graph datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves up to 5x speedup compared to state-of-the-art query optimization techniques, while maintaining high accuracy.
