Online learning in non-stationary environments is a challenging task, particularly when dealing with large-scale datasets. This paper introduces a novel online learning algorithm, 'DeepKOA', that leverages deep kernel approximations to efficiently learn from streaming data. By combining a hierarchical kernel representation with a budgeted online learning framework, DeepKOA achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets while reducing computational complexity. We provide theoretical guarantees for DeepKOA's convergence and demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world applications, such as online recommendation systems and sentiment analysis.
