Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their usability is limited for individuals with dysarthria, a speech disorder characterized by impaired articulation, phonation, and fluency. This paper presents 'EasySpeak', a novel framework for designing accessible voice assistants that can accommodate the unique speech patterns of users with dysarthria. We conducted a user study with 20 participants to inform the design of EasySpeak, which incorporates personalized speech recognition, adaptive error correction, and speech output modification. Our results show that EasySpeak significantly improves the accuracy and efficiency of voice interactions for users with dysarthria, enhancing their overall user experience.
