Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has achieved success in various AI applications, but existing methods often neglect the hierarchical structure inherent in many graphs. This paper proposes a novel KGE framework, 'HiGATE', which leverages hierarchical graph attention to capture complex relationships between entities. By recursively applying attention mechanisms at different graph scales, HiGATE learns more informative and robust embeddings. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiGATE outperforms state-of-the-art KGE models in link prediction and entity classification tasks.
