Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval, but traditional methods often rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a neural ranking model-based approach, 'NeuroXPand', which learns to expand queries by incorporating semantic relationships between words and documents. We utilize a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion and document ranking, enabling our model to adapt to varying query lengths and styles. Experimental results on the TREC-8 and Robust04 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over state-of-the-art query expansion methods.
