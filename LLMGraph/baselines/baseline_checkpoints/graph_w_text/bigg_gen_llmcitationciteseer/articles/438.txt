Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly prevalent, but colorblind users often face difficulties with color-based interfaces. This study examines the effects of colorblind-friendly design on user experience in VR. We conducted a user study with 30 participants, including 10 colorblind individuals, to evaluate the performance and subjective experience of users interacting with colorblind-friendly and traditional VR interfaces. Our results show that colorblind-friendly design significantly improves task completion time, accuracy, and user satisfaction for colorblind users, while also benefiting non-colorblind users. We provide guidelines for designers and developers to create more inclusive VR experiences.
