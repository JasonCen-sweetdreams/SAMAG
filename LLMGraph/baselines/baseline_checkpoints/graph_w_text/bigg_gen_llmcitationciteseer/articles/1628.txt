Temporal graphs have become increasingly important in modeling dynamic relationships between entities. However, querying these graphs efficiently remains a challenging task, particularly for range queries that involve temporal predicates. In this paper, we propose a novel indexing technique, called Temporal Graph Index (TGI), which leverages the temporal locality of graph updates to reduce the search space for range queries. Our approach combines a hierarchical indexing structure with a compact representation of timestamped edges, achieving significant query performance improvements over existing methods. Experimental results on real-world temporal graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TGI in reducing query latency and improving data freshness.
