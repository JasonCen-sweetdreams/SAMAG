In decentralized multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel distributed constraint optimization (DCO) framework for heterogeneous agents, where each agent has unique capabilities and constraints. Our approach, called Het-DCO, leverages asynchronous communication and iterative constraint propagation to ensure task allocation feasibility and optimality. Experimental results on a simulated robotic search and rescue scenario demonstrate that Het-DCO outperforms centralized and decentralized baseline methods in terms of task completion time and success rate.
