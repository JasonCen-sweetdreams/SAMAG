Multi-tenant database-as-a-service (DBaaS) platforms have gained popularity in recent years, but optimizing query performance across multiple tenants remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'OptiTen', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning-based workload characterization and adaptive resource allocation. OptiTen uses a combination of clustering and regression techniques to identify workload patterns and predict resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world DBaaS platform show that OptiTen achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
