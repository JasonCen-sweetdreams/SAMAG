Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on effective passage retrieval to identify relevant texts containing the answer. However, existing methods often struggle with queries that contain ambiguous or rare terms. We propose a novel query-aware document expansion approach, 'QADE', which incorporates query semantics into the passage retrieval process. QADE expands the input query using a neural language model, generating a set of semantically similar queries that are then used to re-rank the retrieved passages. Our experiments on the ODQA benchmark demonstrate that QADE significantly improves passage retrieval accuracy, leading to higher answer accuracy and faster convergence in downstream answer extraction models.
