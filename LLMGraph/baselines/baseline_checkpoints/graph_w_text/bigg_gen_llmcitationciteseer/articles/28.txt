Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems often struggle to capture nuanced contextual relationships between query terms and document contents. This paper presents a novel approach, Hierarchical Aspect Embeddings (HAE), which leverages graph-based hierarchical representations to model complex aspect dependencies in documents. By integrating HAE into a neural ranking model, we demonstrate significant improvements in context-aware retrieval tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of HAE in capturing subtle contextual cues, leading to more accurate retrieval results.
