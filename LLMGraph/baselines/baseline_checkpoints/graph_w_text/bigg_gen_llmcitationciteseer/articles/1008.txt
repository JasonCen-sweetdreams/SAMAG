Time series forecasting is a fundamental task in many applications, but the lack of interpretability in modern neural network-based models hinders their adoption in high-stakes domains. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical attention network (HAN) architecture that incorporates both local and global attention mechanisms to selectively focus on relevant temporal patterns. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HAN in achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets while providing visually interpretable attention weights that explain the forecasting decisions.
