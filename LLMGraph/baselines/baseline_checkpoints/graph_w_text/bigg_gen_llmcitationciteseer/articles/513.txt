Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have the potential to revolutionize healthcare interactions, but their design often neglects the needs of users with disabilities or from diverse cultural backgrounds. This paper presents a human-centered approach to designing ECAs for inclusive and accessible healthcare interactions. We conducted a series of co-design workshops with healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers to identify key design requirements. We then developed and evaluated an ECA prototype that incorporates multimodal interaction, affective computing, and culturally sensitive dialogue management. Our results show that users with disabilities and from diverse backgrounds perceive the ECA as more trustworthy, empathetic, and effective in facilitating healthcare conversations.
