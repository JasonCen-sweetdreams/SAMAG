Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) to improve retrieval accuracy. However, existing methods rely on manual feature engineering and may not generalize well to diverse query types. This paper proposes a neural query expansion approach, 'NeuroQE', which leverages dense neural embeddings to capture semantic relationships between query terms and documents. NeuroQE adaptively generates expansion terms by predicting relevance scores between query and document embeddings. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance and robustness to out-of-vocabulary queries, compared to state-of-the-art expansion methods.
