Distributed database systems (DDS) have become increasingly popular for handling large-scale data storage and querying. However, optimizing query performance in DDS remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel graph-based indexing approach, 'GraphIx', which leverages the structural properties of data graphs to accelerate query execution. GraphIx integrates a hierarchical indexing scheme with a cost-based query optimizer to minimize query latency. Experimental evaluation on a real-world social network dataset demonstrates that GraphIx outperforms traditional indexing techniques by up to 30% in terms of query response time.
