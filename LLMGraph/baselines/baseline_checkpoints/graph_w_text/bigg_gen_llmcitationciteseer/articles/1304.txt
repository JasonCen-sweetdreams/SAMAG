Neural search engines have shown promising results in capturing semantic relationships between queries and documents. However, they often struggle with ambiguous or underspecified queries. This paper proposes a novel context-aware query expansion approach, 'CAQE', which leverages both local and global context to disambiguate queries and improve retrieval performance. We introduce a hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively weights the importance of context features based on the query semantics. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that CAQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, especially in cases where the original query is vague or incomplete.
