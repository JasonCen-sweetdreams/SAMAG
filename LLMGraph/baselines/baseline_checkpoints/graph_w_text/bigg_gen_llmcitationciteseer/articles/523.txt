In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is a crucial task that enables agents to achieve common goals. Existing approaches rely on centralized controllers or assume complete knowledge of the environment. This paper proposes a decentralized framework for coalition formation using graph neural networks (GNNs). We introduce a novel GNN architecture that learns to represent agent relationships and preferences, allowing agents to form coalitions in a distributed manner. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of coalition stability and task completion rate.
