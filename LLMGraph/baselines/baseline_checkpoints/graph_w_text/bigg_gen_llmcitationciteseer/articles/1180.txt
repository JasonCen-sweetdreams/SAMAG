Node classification in attributed graphs is a crucial task in various applications, including social network analysis and bioinformatics. However, existing graph neural network models often suffer from limited scalability and neglect the importance of node attributes. We propose a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that effectively incorporates node attributes and leverages hierarchical graph structures to capture long-range dependencies. Experimental results on several real-world datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of node classification accuracy and computational efficiency.
