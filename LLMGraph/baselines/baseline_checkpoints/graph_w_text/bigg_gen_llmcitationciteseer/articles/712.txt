Open-domain question answering (ODQA) relies on efficient passage retrieval to identify relevant documents that contain the answer. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Dense Retrieval (HDR) approach, which leverages a two-stage retrieval process to prune the search space and reduce computational costs. Our method exploits the hierarchical structure of documents and represents passages as dense vectors, enabling fast similarity search and accurate retrieval. Experimental results on several ODQA benchmarks demonstrate that HDR outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods, achieving a 25% increase in recall while reducing computational costs by 40%.
