Individuals with motor impairments face significant challenges when interacting with gesture-based interfaces. This paper presents a novel approach to designing accessible gesture recognition systems that adapt to the unique abilities of users with motor impairments. We propose a machine learning-based framework that leverages electromyography (EMG) signals to recognize gestures, and introduces a personalized gesture set selection algorithm to improve recognition accuracy. Our user study with 15 participants with motor impairments demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms existing gesture recognition systems, enabling more accurate and efficient interaction.
