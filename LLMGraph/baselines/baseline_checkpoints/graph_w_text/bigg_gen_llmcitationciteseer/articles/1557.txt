The proliferation of IoT devices has generated vast amounts of time series data, making it challenging to detect anomalies in real-time. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'IoT-ADNet', which leverages a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to identify anomalies in IoT time series data. IoT-ADNet incorporates a transfer learning mechanism to adapt to new devices and scenarios, achieving high detection accuracy and low false positive rates. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of IoT-ADNet in detecting anomalies in real-time, outperforming traditional machine learning and statistical methods.
