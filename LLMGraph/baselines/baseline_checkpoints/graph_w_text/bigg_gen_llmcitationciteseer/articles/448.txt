Voice-based interfaces have become increasingly prevalent in various domains, including smart homes, virtual assistants, and in-vehicle systems. However, the cognitive load imposed by these interfaces on users remains understudied. This paper investigates the effects of cognitive load on user experience, focusing on speech recognition accuracy, response time, and subjective workload. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, who interacted with a voice-based interface while performing cognitive tasks of varying difficulty. Our results show that high cognitive load significantly impairs speech recognition accuracy and increases response time, leading to decreased user satisfaction. We propose design guidelines for mitigating cognitive load in voice-based interfaces, emphasizing the importance of considering users' cognitive capacity in HCI design.
