Short-text retrieval in social media poses unique challenges due to the brevity and noisiness of user-generated content. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework, 'SocialTE', which leverages both local and global context to enrich the query representation. Our approach incorporates a graph-based method to model entity relationships and a neural ranking model to re-weight query terms. Experimental results on a large-scale Twitter dataset demonstrate that SocialTE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques in terms of retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.
