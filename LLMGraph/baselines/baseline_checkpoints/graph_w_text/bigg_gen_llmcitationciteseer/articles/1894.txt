This paper proposes a decentralized multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework for real-time traffic flow optimization in complex road networks. Our approach, dubbed 'TrafficMaster', leverages graph neural networks to model the dynamic interactions between agents, and introduces a novel attention-based mechanism to adaptively prioritize traffic signals at key intersections. Experimental results on a large-scale simulation platform demonstrate that TrafficMaster achieves significant reductions in travel time, congestion, and emissions compared to traditional traffic management systems, while maintaining scalability and robustness in the face of uncertain traffic conditions.
