 Autonomous vehicles rely on accurate object detection to ensure safety and efficiency. This paper introduces 'Co-Detect', a novel framework that enables real-time human-AI collaboration for object detection. Co-Detect leverages active learning to selectively request human annotations for uncertain or ambiguous objects, thereby improving detection accuracy. We propose a novel uncertainty quantification method, 'U-Net+', which outperforms existing approaches in identifying uncertain regions. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that Co-Detect achieves a 25% reduction in annotation time and a 15% increase in detection accuracy compared to state-of-the-art object detection models.
