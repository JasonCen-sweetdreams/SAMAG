Entity disambiguation is a crucial step in data integration, but its scalability is limited by the growth of large-scale databases. We propose 'HashED', a novel indexing approach that leverages hash-based partitioning to efficiently disambiguate entities across distributed databases. By exploiting the properties of hash functions, HashED reduces the number of comparisons required for entity matching, leading to significant performance improvements. Our evaluation on a real-world dataset shows that HashED outperforms existing approaches by up to 3x in terms of query response time, while maintaining high accuracy.
