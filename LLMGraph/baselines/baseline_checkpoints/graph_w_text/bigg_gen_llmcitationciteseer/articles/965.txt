 Gesture recognition systems have transformed human-computer interaction, but users with motor impairments often face difficulties using these systems. This paper proposes an adaptive gesture recognition framework that learns to recognize gestures from users with varying abilities. Our approach leverages machine learning to identify patterns in gesture data and adjusts the recognition model in real-time. We conducted a user study with 20 participants with motor impairments and demonstrated a significant improvement in gesture recognition accuracy and user satisfaction. Our system has the potential to enhance the accessibility and inclusivity of HCI systems for users with motor impairments.
