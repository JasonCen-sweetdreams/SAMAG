Multi-tenancy is becoming increasingly popular in cloud-based relational databases, where multiple tenants share a common database instance. However, this architecture introduces query optimization challenges, as each tenant's workload may have distinct performance characteristics. This paper proposes a novel query optimization approach that leverages column store indexing to improve query performance in multi-tenant relational databases. Our proposed algorithm, 'TenantAware', adapts to the dynamic workload patterns of each tenant and optimizes query plans accordingly. Experimental results on a real-world benchmark dataset demonstrate significant query performance improvements compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
