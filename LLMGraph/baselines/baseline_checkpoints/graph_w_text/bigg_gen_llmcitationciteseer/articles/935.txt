State-of-the-art neural ranking models for information retrieval often suffer from high computational costs and laborious training procedures. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural ranking framework, 'HierRank', which leverages document embeddings and attention mechanisms to efficiently filter and rank documents. By hierarchically aggregating relevance signals from multiple granularities, HierRank achieves significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness while reducing computational overhead. Experiments on the TREC-2004 dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming existing neural ranking models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
