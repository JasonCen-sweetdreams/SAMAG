Entity disambiguation is a crucial task in knowledge graph construction, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in a text. Existing approaches often suffer from scalability issues or require extensive manual annotation. This paper proposes a novel framework, 'GEDAL', which leverages graph neural networks and active learning to efficiently disambiguate entities in large-scale knowledge graphs. We introduce a hierarchical graph attention mechanism that captures both local and global context, and an active learning strategy that selects the most informative samples for annotation. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of GEDAL, achieving state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced annotation costs.
