State-of-the-art neural ranking models for search have primarily focused on individual queries, neglecting the rich contextual information available in user sessions. This paper proposes a novel behavioral graph attention mechanism to incorporate session history into ranking models. Our approach jointly learns user behavior graphs and neural ranking models, enabling the capture of complex query dependencies and user preferences. Experimental results on the TREC 2020 Session Track dataset demonstrate significant improvements in ranking quality and user satisfaction metrics compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
