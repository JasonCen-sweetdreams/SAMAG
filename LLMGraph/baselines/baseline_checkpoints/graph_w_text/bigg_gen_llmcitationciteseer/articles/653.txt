This paper explores the application of embodied cognition principles in virtual reality (VR) to improve spatial reasoning skills. We designed a gestural interface, 'SpatialGest', that leverages users' bodily experiences to facilitate 3D spatial problem-solving. In a user study with 30 participants, we found that SpatialGest significantly enhanced spatial reasoning abilities compared to traditional keyboard-and-mouse interfaces. Our findings suggest that embodied cognition can be effectively utilized in VR-based learning environments to improve cognitive skills, with implications for fields such as architecture, engineering, and computer-aided design.
