Task-oriented dialogue systems aim to efficiently complete tasks through natural language interactions. We propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HiTRL', that leverages a two-level hierarchical structure to learn both dialogue management and response generation policies. The upper level learns to select relevant intent-specific sub-policies, while the lower level refines the response generation using a novel intent-aware attention mechanism. Our experiments on the DSTC2 benchmark demonstrate that HiTRL outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of task success rate, average reward, and response quality.
