In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. However, the complexity of agent communication strategies can significantly impact system performance. This paper proposes an adaptive communication framework that dynamically adjusts the level of information exchange between agents based on task requirements and environmental uncertainty. We develop a novel probabilistic model to quantify the value of information exchange and demonstrate its effectiveness in reducing communication overhead while maintaining task allocation efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing strategies in various scenarios, including resource-constrained and dynamic environments.
