Data warehousing is a crucial component of business intelligence, but maintaining materialized views in the face of continuous data updates remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel incremental view maintenance (IVM) approach, 'DynIVM', that leverages a hybrid of incremental query processing and dynamic indexing. DynIVM efficiently handles insertions, deletions, and updates by selectively re-computing only affected view fragments, thereby minimizing recomputation overhead. Extensive experiments on the TPC-DS benchmark reveal that DynIVM outperforms state-of-the-art IVM techniques by up to 3x in terms of refresh latency and 2x in terms of storage savings.
