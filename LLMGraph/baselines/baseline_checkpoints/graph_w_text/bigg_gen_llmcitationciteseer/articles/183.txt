Multidimensional data cubes are crucial for fast query processing in data warehouses. However, optimizing queries on these cubes is computationally expensive, especially for large datasets. This paper presents a novel approach, 'CubeGPU', which leverages Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate aggregation operations in query optimization. By exploiting the massively parallel architecture of modern GPUs, CubeGPU achieves significant speedups over traditional CPU-based optimization techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a real-world dataset and various query workloads, showcasing up to 10x performance improvement.
