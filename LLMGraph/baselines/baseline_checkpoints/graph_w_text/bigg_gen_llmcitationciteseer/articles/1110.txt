Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems are increasingly popular for large-scale data processing. However, query efficiency remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical clustering approach, 'HierDir', to optimize query processing in DIR systems. HierDir leverages a combination of k-means and hierarchical agglomerative clustering to group similar documents and reduce the search space. Our experiments on the ClueWeb09 dataset demonstrate that HierDir achieves up to 35% improvement in query response time compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable retrieval accuracy.
