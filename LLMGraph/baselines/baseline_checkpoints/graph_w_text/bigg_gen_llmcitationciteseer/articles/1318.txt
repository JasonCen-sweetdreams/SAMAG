Passage retrieval is a crucial component in many natural language processing applications, including question answering and text summarization. However, existing methods often rely on computationally expensive dense representations, which can limit their scalability. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical document representation (HDR) framework, which leverages a hierarchical attention mechanism to encode documents at multiple granularities. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HDR achieves state-of-the-art passage retrieval performance while reducing computational costs by up to 50% compared to existing methods.
