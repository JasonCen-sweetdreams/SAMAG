Conversational AI models often rely on black-box neural networks, hindering their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Attention Network (HAN) for dialogue generation, which incorporates explainability mechanisms at multiple levels. HAN leverages attention weights to identify crucial context and utterance features, enabling transparent and interpretable response generation. We evaluate HAN on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in response quality and coherence while providing insights into the model's decision-making process.
