Query expansion is a crucial technique in information retrieval (IR) that aims to refine the original query to better capture the user's intent. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and suffer from limited generalizability. This paper proposes a novel approach, NeuralQE, which leverages deep neural networks to learn query expansion strategies from large-scale datasets. We design a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query expansion and relevance ranking, and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance over state-of-the-art baselines on several standard IR benchmarks. Our results highlight the potential of neural networks in advancing the field of IR.
