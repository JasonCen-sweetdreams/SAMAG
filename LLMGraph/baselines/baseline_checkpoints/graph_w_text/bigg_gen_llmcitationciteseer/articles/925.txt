In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for accomplishing complex tasks. This paper presents a novel distributed task allocation framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning to optimize task assignments among agents. Our approach, called 'DRL-TA', utilizes a decentralized, actor-critic architecture to learn effective task allocation policies that balance task workload, agent capabilities, and communication costs. Experimental results on a simulated urban search and rescue scenario demonstrate that DRL-TA outperforms traditional, rule-based allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
