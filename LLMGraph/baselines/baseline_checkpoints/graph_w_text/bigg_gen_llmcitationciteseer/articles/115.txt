Ad-hoc retrieval tasks often suffer from vocabulary mismatch between the query and relevant documents. This paper introduces a novel query expansion approach, Graph Semantic Expansion (GSE), which leverages graph-based semantic embeddings to capture nuanced relationships between terms. GSE represents the query and document terms as nodes in a graph, and computes semantic similarities using a variant of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Our experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that GSE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and recall. We further analyze the impact of graph structures and node features on the effectiveness of GSE.
