Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in modern life, but their effectiveness can be limited by age-related differences in voice command interpretation. This study investigates how older adults (65+ years) interact with voice assistants compared to younger adults (18-30 years). We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 100 participants, analyzing voice command data and conducting semi-structured interviews. Our results show that older adults experience higher error rates and frustration due to differences in linguistic patterns, cognitive abilities, and technology familiarity. We propose a set of design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants, including adaptive language models, multimodal feedback, and personalized training protocols.
