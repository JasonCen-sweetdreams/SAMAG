Query expansion (QE) is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, but existing methods often neglect the context in which queries are issued. This paper proposes a novel QE approach, 'ConEx', which leverages context-aware embeddings to capture the nuances of user intent. By incorporating contextual information, such as user location and search history, ConEx generates more informative and diverse expansion terms, leading to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of ConEx over state-of-the-art QE methods, particularly in scenarios with ambiguous or underspecified queries.
