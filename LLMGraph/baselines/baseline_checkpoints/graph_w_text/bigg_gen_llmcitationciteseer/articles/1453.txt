Explainability in multi-agent systems is crucial for trust and accountability. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'CausalGraphX', which integrates causal graph attention mechanisms into deep reinforcement learning to enable interpretable decision-making in complex multi-agent scenarios. We demonstrate that CausalGraphX outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various cooperative and competitive domains, providing insights into agent interactions and causal relationships. Our approach has significant implications for real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles and smart grids, where explainability is paramount.
