Recent advances in graph neural networks (GNNs) have led to significant improvements in recommendation systems. However, the lack of explainability in these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical GNN architecture, 'HierExplain', which integrates attention-based feature importance and graph-based explanations to provide transparent recommendations. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that HierExplain outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both recommendation accuracy and explanation quality.
