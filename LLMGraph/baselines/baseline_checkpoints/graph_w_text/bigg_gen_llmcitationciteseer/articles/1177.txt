Traditional information retrieval systems rely on hand-crafted features and ranking models, which may not capture complex document relationships. This paper proposes a novel graph-based neural network approach, GraphRank, which learns to represent documents as nodes in a graph and captures their semantic relationships. We leverage graph attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of neighboring documents and adapt to varying query contexts. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that GraphRank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving a 12% improvement in NDCG@10.
