Few-shot relation extraction (FSRE) aims to identify relationships between entities in a given text, using limited supervision. We propose a novel hierarchical attention graph convolutional network (HAGCN) that leverages both entity-level and graph-level attention mechanisms to improve FSRE performance. Our approach utilizes a hierarchical graph structure to model complex relationships between entities and incorporates a meta-learning framework to adapt to new relations with few examples. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HAGCN in achieving state-of-the-art performance for FSRE tasks.
