Anomaly detection in multivariate time series data is a crucial task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and IoT. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach, 'MTS-AD', which leverages the strengths of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to identify anomalies in high-dimensional time series data. Our approach involves learning a robust representation of normal patterns using CNNs and then feeding these representations into an LSTM network to capture temporal dependencies. We evaluate MTS-AD on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
