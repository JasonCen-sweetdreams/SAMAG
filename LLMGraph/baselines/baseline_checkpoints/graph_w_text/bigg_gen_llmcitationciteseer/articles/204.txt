This paper proposes a novel planning framework for multi-agent systems, focusing on scalability and efficiency. We introduce Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) to model complex tasks and leverage a hierarchical planning architecture to decompose tasks into smaller sub-tasks. Our approach enables agents to reason about task dependencies and allocate resources effectively, leading to improved plan quality and reduced planning time. Experimental results on a logistics domain demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of plan quality and execution time.
