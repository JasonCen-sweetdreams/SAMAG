Anomaly detection in high-dimensional data is a challenging task due to the curse of dimensionality. Existing methods often suffer from high computational complexity or poor detection accuracy. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Self-Organizing Maps (HiSOM), which leverages the strengths of self-organizing maps and hierarchical clustering. HiSOM efficiently identifies anomalies in high-dimensional data by iteratively applying SOMs to local clusters and adaptively adjusting the number of clusters. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiSOM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and computational efficiency.
