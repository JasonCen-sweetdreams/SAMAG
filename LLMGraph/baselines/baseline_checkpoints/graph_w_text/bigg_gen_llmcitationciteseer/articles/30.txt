As virtual reality (VR) technology becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding user engagement and interaction is crucial for its adoption. This paper explores the effect of personalized avatar customization on user experience in VR environments. We conducted a user study with 100 participants, offering varying levels of customization options for their avatars. Our results show that users who created personalized avatars exhibited higher levels of engagement, self-presence, and enjoyment compared to those with default avatars. We discuss the implications of these findings on VR system design and provide recommendations for incorporating personalized avatar customization in future VR applications.
