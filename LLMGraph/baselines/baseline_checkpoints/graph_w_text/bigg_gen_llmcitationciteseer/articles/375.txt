Voice assistants have revolutionized human-computer interaction, but their adoption among older adults is hindered by limited accessibility and usability. This paper presents a novel approach to personalized dialogue management for voice assistants, tailored to the needs and preferences of older adults. We propose a machine learning-based framework that integrates user modeling, dialogue context, and affective computing to generate empathetic and supportive responses. A user study with 30 older adults demonstrates significant improvements in user satisfaction, engagement, and task completion rates compared to commercial voice assistants.
