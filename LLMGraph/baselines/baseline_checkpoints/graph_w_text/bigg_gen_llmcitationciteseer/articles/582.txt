This paper presents a novel approach to urban traffic management using autonomous agents coordinated through deep reinforcement learning. Our proposed framework, 'TrafficIQ', consists of a network of agents that learn to optimize traffic signal control in real-time, taking into account dynamic traffic patterns, pedestrian and cyclist safety, and environmental impact. We evaluate TrafficIQ in a simulated urban environment and demonstrate significant reductions in congestion, travel time, and emissions compared to traditional traffic management systems. The proposed framework has potential for large-scale deployment in smart cities.
