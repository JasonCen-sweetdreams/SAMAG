This paper explores the design of conversational interfaces for older adults, focusing on voice-based interaction. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, examining their experiences with existing voice assistants and identifying key usability challenges. Based on our findings, we propose a set of design guidelines for accessible conversational interfaces, including simplification of voice commands, explicit feedback mechanisms, and personalized error handling. Our study contributes to the development of more inclusive and supportive voice-based interfaces for older adults.
