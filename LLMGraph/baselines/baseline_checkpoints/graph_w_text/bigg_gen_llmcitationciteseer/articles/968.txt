Patent retrieval systems often struggle to accurately retrieve relevant documents due to the complexity of patent queries. This paper proposes a novel approach that leverages knowledge graphs to expand patent queries. We construct a knowledge graph from a large patent corpus and develop a graph-based ranking model to select relevant expansion terms. Experimental results on a standard patent retrieval dataset show that our approach significantly improves the retrieval performance compared to traditional query expansion methods, especially for queries with low term frequency.
