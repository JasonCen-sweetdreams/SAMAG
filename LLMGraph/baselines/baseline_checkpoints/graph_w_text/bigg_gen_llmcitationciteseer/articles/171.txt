Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle with the vocabulary mismatch problem, where query terms fail to match relevant document content. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'GraKE', which leverages graph-based keyword embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. Our method represents queries and documents as graph structures, allowing for the propagation of semantic information between nodes. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that GraKE outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% increase in mean average precision. Our approach is particularly effective for short queries and documents with limited context.
