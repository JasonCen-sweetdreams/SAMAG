Distributed database systems are increasingly used to manage large-scale data, but query performance remains a significant bottleneck. This paper explores the application of learned index structures to optimize query performance in such systems. We propose a novel learned index framework, 'QOpt', which leverages neural networks to predict the optimal index configuration for a given query workload. Our approach adaptively adjusts the index structure based on query patterns and data distributions, resulting in significant improvements in query response times and resource utilization. Experimental evaluation on a real-world distributed database system demonstrates the efficacy of QOpt in reducing query latency by up to 3x compared to traditional indexing techniques.
