Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval, as it aims to capture the underlying intent of the user's query. Traditional methods rely on manual feature engineering and shallow models, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel neural query expansion framework, 'NeuroQE', which leverages deep neural networks to learn semantic representations of queries and documents. We utilize a multi-task learning objective that jointly optimizes query expansion and relevance ranking, resulting in significant improvements in retrieval performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NeuroQE in capturing nuanced query semantics and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
