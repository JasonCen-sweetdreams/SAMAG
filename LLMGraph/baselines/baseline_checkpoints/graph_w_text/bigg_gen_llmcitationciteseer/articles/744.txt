The proliferation of IoT devices and sensors has led to an explosion of time-series data, posing significant challenges for efficient query processing and indexing. This paper presents a novel hybrid indexing approach, termed 'HybridTS', which combines the benefits of B-Tree and Grid indexing to support fast range queries and aggregations on real-time time-series data. Our approach leverages a dynamic re-balancing mechanism to adapt to changing data distributions and query patterns, ensuring high performance and scalability. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that HybridTS outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time and 2x in storage efficiency.
