In distributed database systems, indexing mechanisms play a crucial role in optimizing query performance. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'DxTree', designed to efficiently handle multi-dimensional range queries in distributed environments. DxTree leverages a hierarchical, distributed indexing structure that adaptively partitions the data space based on query patterns and data distribution. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that DxTree outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of query latency and throughput, while minimizing communication overhead and ensuring data consistency.
