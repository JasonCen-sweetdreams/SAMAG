Graph pattern matching is a fundamental operation in graph databases, but its computational complexity hinders its adoption in large-scale applications. This paper proposes a novel GPU-accelerated indexing approach for efficient graph pattern matching. Our method, called GPU-GPM, leverages the massively parallel architecture of modern GPUs to accelerate the pattern matching process. We also introduce a novel indexing scheme that reduces the memory footprint of the graph index, allowing for scalable pattern matching on large graphs. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GPU-GPM outperforms state-of-the-art CPU-based approaches by up to 10x in terms of query response time.
