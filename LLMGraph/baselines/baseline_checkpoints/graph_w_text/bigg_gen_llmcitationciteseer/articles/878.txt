In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving global objectives. This paper presents a decentralized task allocation framework inspired by swarm intelligence, where agents self-organize to optimize task assignments. Our approach leverages a distributed auction mechanism, where agents bid on tasks based on their capabilities and preferences. We introduce a novel pheromone-based communication protocol that enables agents to adapt to changing task demands and environmental conditions. Experimental results on a simulated search-and-rescue scenario demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional centralized allocation methods in terms of task completion time and agent utilization.
