Multi-tenant data warehouses face significant performance challenges due to concurrent query workloads. Traditional query optimization techniques struggle to adapt to dynamic workload patterns. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'RL-Optimizer', which leverages reinforcement learning to optimize query execution plans for multi-tenant data warehouses. RL-Optimizer learns to predict optimal join orders, indexing strategies, and resource allocation from historical query patterns and workload characteristics. Experimental results on a real-world data warehouse benchmark demonstrate that RL-Optimizer outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 30% in terms of query response time and resource utilization.
