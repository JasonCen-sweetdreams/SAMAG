In multi-agent systems, effective negotiation is crucial for achieving optimal outcomes in dynamic environments. This paper presents a novel framework for adaptive negotiation strategies, where agents learn to adjust their behavior based on environmental changes and opponent responses. We introduce a hybrid approach combining game-theoretic analysis with machine learning techniques, enabling agents to balance cooperation and competition. Experimental results demonstrate improved negotiation outcomes and adaptability in various scenarios, including supply chain management and resource allocation.
