Query reformulation is a crucial step in document retrieval systems, as it can significantly impact the relevance and efficiency of search results. This paper proposes a novel deep learning approach, 'HierReform', which leverages hierarchical query representations to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms. Our method uses a combination of word embeddings and graph attention mechanisms to identify key query components and generate effective reformulations. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierReform outperforms state-of-the-art query reformulation techniques in terms of both retrieval accuracy and computational efficiency.
