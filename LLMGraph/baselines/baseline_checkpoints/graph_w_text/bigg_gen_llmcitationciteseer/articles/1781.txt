Voice assistants have transformed the way we interact with technology, but their potential benefits are often inaccessible to older adults. This paper reports on a participatory design study involving 20 older adults with diverse abilities, aiming to co-create accessible voice assistant features. We identified three key themes: personalized voice profiles, multimodal feedback, and contextual assistance. Our findings inform the development of inclusive voice assistants that cater to the unique needs of older adults, enhancing their autonomy and quality of life. We propose a set of design guidelines for accessible voice assistants, emphasizing the importance of user-centered design in HCI research.
