Virtual reality (VR) has become increasingly prevalent, but its adoption is hindered by user discomfort and fatigue. This paper explores the role of haptic feedback in enhancing user experience in VR. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants, using a custom-built VR system with integrated haptic feedback. Our results show a significant reduction in user discomfort and improved spatial awareness when haptic feedback is present. We also identify key design factors influencing the effectiveness of haptic feedback, including vibration frequency and amplitude. Our findings have implications for the design of VR systems and applications, particularly in fields like education, healthcare, and entertainment.
