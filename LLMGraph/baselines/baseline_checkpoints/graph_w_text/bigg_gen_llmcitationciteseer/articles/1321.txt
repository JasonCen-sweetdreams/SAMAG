Ad-hoc retrieval systems often struggle to capture the nuances of user queries, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach, 'HierGAT-QE', which leverages hierarchical graph attention networks to model complex relationships between query terms and their expansions. We introduce a multi-level attention mechanism that adaptively weights term importance at both the local and global levels, enabling more effective query refinement. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that HierGAT-QE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving improved retrieval precision and recall.
