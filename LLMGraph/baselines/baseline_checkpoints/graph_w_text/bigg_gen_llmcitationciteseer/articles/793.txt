Main-memory databases (MMDBs) have become increasingly popular for high-performance applications. However, optimizing query workloads on MMDBs remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the use of learned index structures to improve query performance. We propose a novel approach, 'QLIS', which leverages machine learning models to predict query access patterns and adaptively reorganize index structures. Our experimental evaluation on a real-world MMDB benchmark demonstrates that QLIS achieves an average query latency reduction of 32% compared to state-of-the-art indexing techniques.
