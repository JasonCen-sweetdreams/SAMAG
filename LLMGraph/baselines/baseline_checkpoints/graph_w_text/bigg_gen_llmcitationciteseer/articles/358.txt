Virtual reality (VR) has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with digital information, but current VR systems often exclude users with visual impairments. This paper presents a novel framework for designing inclusive VR experiences that are accessible to users with visual impairments. We conducted a series of user studies to identify key challenges and opportunities for accessibility in VR, and developed a set of design guidelines and tools to support the creation of inclusive VR applications. Our evaluation results show that our approach can significantly improve the usability and enjoyment of VR experiences for users with visual impairments.
