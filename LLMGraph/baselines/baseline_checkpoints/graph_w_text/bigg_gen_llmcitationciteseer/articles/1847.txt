This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user engagement in virtual reality (VR)-based learning environments. We designed an experiment where participants interacted with a VR learning platform using either a generic or personalized avatar. Our results show that users who interacted with personalized avatars demonstrated higher levels of engagement, motivation, and knowledge retention compared to those using generic avatars. We also found that users' self-reported sense of presence and embodiment in the virtual environment were strong predictors of engagement. The findings have implications for the design of VR-based learning systems and suggest that personalized avatars can be a key factor in enhancing user experience and learning outcomes.
