Few-shot learning (FSL) has gained popularity in recent years, but existing methods struggle with scalability and robustness. This paper presents Hierarchical Prototypical Networks (HPN), a novel FSL framework that leverages hierarchical clustering and prototypical representations to improve performance and efficiency. HPN learns a hierarchy of prototypes from a few labeled examples, enabling fast adaptation to new classes and robustness to noisy data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HPN on multiple benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in few-shot image classification and outperforming existing methods by a significant margin.
