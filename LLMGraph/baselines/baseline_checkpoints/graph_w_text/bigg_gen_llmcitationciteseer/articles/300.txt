Modern search engines often prioritize relevance over diversity, leading to redundant results. This paper proposes a novel approach to diversified search ranking, employing continuous query embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between queries and documents. Our Adaptive Re-ranking (AR) model iteratively updates the query embedding based on the initial retrieval results, allowing for more effective diversification of the top-ranked documents. Experiments on the TREC Web Track dataset demonstrate significant improvements in novelty and diversity metrics, while maintaining competitive relevance performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
