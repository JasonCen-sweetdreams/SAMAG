Ad-hoc search queries often lack sufficient context, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance. This paper presents a novel approach to query expansion using deep neural networks. Our proposed model, 'QE-Net', employs a multi-task learning framework that jointly optimizes query representation, term weighting, and expansion. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, outperforming state-of-the-art query expansion techniques. We also provide insights into the learned query representations and their impact on retrieval performance.
