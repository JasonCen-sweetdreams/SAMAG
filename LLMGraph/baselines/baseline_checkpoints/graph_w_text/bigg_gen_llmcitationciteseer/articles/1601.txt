In complex, dynamic environments, task allocation among multiple agents is a critical problem. This paper presents a decentralized coalition formation approach, 'DCF-TA', that enables agents to form coalitions and allocate tasks in a distributed manner. DCF-TA leverages graph neural networks to model agent interactions and a novel, anytime algorithm to accommodate dynamic task arrivals and departures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DCF-TA through extensive simulations, showcasing improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to centralized and traditional distributed approaches.
