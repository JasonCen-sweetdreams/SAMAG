Node classification is a fundamental task in graph-structured data, but it often suffers from limited labeled data. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical graph attention network (HGAT) that leverages both local and global graph structures to improve node classification performance. HGAT uses a multi-level attention mechanism to selectively focus on informative neighbors and capture long-range dependencies. We evaluate HGAT on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods, especially in the low-label regime. We also provide theoretical insights into the effectiveness of HGAT in capturing hierarchical graph structures.
