Virtual reality (VR) interfaces rely on manual input devices, which can be cumbersome and limit the immersive experience. This paper presents a novel gaze-based input method using deep learning-based eye tracking. Our approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect gaze patterns and a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict user intent. We evaluate our method on a VR gaming platform and show that it achieves high accuracy and low latency, enabling seamless interaction with virtual objects. Our approach has significant implications for enhancing the usability and accessibility of VR systems.
