Multi-tenant database systems (MTDBS) have become increasingly popular in cloud computing environments, where multiple tenants share the same database instance. However, optimizing query performance for heterogeneous workloads remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'MT-Opt', which leverages machine learning-based workload classification and dynamic re-optimization. MT-Opt adaptively adjusts query plans based on real-time workload characteristics, reducing average query latency by up to 35% and improving overall system throughput by 25%. Experimental evaluation on a real-world MTDBS setup demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.
