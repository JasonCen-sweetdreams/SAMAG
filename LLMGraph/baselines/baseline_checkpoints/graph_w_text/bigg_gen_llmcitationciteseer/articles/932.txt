Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc retrieval, which aims to reformulate the original query to better match the relevant documents. This paper proposes a novel query expansion approach using deep neural networks. Our method leverages a multi-layer perceptron to learn the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion terms. We also introduce a novel ranking mechanism that incorporates both the original query and expanded query to re-rank the documents. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms existing query expansion methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision.
