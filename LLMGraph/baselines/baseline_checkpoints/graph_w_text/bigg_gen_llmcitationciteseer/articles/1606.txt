In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is a critical problem that involves grouping agents to achieve a common goal. This paper presents a novel distributed coalition formation algorithm using stochastic graph theory. We model the agent interactions as a stochastic graph and propose a decentralized approach to identify the optimal coalition structure. Our algorithm leverages the theory of random graph models to efficiently explore the exponentially large space of possible coalitions. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of coalition quality and convergence speed.
