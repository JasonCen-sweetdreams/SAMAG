Query expansion is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, aiming to reformulate the original query to better capture user intent. Existing methods rely on heuristics or manual feature engineering, often resulting in suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning approach, 'DeepQE', which learns to optimize query expansion policies through trial and error. We design a reward function that balances retrieval accuracy and efficiency, and incorporate a hierarchical attention mechanism to adaptively select relevant expansion terms. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepQE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of mean average precision and retrieval time.
