Swarm robotics has numerous applications in search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and agriculture. However, task allocation in such systems remains a challenging problem, particularly in dynamic and uncertain environments. This paper proposes a decentralized task allocation framework that leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'MARL-TA', enables individual robots to learn cooperative strategies for task allocation through self-organization and adaptation. We evaluate MARL-TA using a simulated search and rescue scenario and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving task completion rates and reducing communication overhead compared to traditional centralized approaches.
