In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving collective goals. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HTA', which enables agents to learn coordinated task allocation strategies. HTA consists of a high-level coordinator that assigns tasks to agents based on their capabilities and a low-level reinforcement learning module that adapts to changing environmental conditions. We evaluate HTA on a simulated disaster response scenario and demonstrate significant improvements in task completion rates and overall system efficiency compared to decentralized and centralized baselines.
