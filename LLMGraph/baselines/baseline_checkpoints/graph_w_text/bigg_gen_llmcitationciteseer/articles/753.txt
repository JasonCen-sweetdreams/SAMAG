Neural search engines have shown promising results in various information retrieval tasks, but they often struggle with sparse query representations. This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages graph-based embeddings to capture nuanced semantic relationships between query terms. Our approach, dubbed 'GraphExpand', uses a graph convolutional network to learn dense embeddings of query terms and their co-occurrences in a large corpus. We demonstrate that GraphExpand outperforms existing query expansion techniques on several benchmark datasets, leading to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness. Furthermore, we show that GraphExpand can be seamlessly integrated with existing neural search architectures, making it a practical solution for real-world search engines.
