The proliferation of IoT devices and real-time analytics applications has created an unprecedented need for efficient data warehousing solutions. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'RT-Colix', designed specifically for column-oriented storage systems. RT-Colix leverages a hybrid approach, combining a compact in-memory index with a disk-based index, to minimize query latency and optimize storage utilization. Our experiments on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that RT-Colix outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods, achieving up to 3x faster query execution times and 2x storage savings.
