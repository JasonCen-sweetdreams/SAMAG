Query expansion is a crucial step in ad-hoc information retrieval, where the goal is to reformulate the initial query to better match the relevant documents. However, existing methods rely heavily on handcrafted features and heuristics, which may not generalize well to diverse query types. We propose a novel reinforcement learning-based approach, 'RL-QE', which learns to select expansion terms by interacting with a simulated retrieval environment. Our experiments on the TREC-8 ad-hoc track demonstrate that RL-QE outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
