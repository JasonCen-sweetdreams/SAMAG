The proliferation of IoT devices and social media platforms has generated an unprecedented volume of data, necessitating real-time analytics to derive timely insights. Distributed database systems (DDS) are well-suited for handling such workloads, but query optimization remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'RTOpt', which leverages machine learning-based cardinality estimation and adaptive join ordering to minimize query latency. Our experiments on a real-world DDS setup demonstrate that RTOpt achieves up to 3.5x improvement in query response time compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
