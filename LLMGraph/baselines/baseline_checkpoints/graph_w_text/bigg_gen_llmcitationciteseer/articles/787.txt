Anomaly detection in time-series data is crucial for various applications, including monitoring critical infrastructure and detecting financial fraud. However, most existing methods lack interpretability, making it challenging to identify the root causes of anomalies. This paper proposes a hierarchical attention network (HAN) for explainable time-series anomaly detection. Our HAN model consists of two levels of attention mechanisms: a local attention module that captures short-term patterns and a global attention module that incorporates long-term dependencies. We evaluate our approach on several real-world datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in detecting anomalies while providing insightful explanations.
