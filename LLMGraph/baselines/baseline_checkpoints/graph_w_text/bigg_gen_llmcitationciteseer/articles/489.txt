Voice assistants have become ubiquitous in many households, but their effectiveness for older adults is often hindered by speech recognition inaccuracies and usability issues. This study investigates the design of inclusive voice assistants tailored to the needs of older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study involving 30 participants aged 65+, examining the impact of speech recognition algorithms and user interface design on user experience. Our results show that incorporating age-specific speech patterns and adapting dialogue flows to accommodate cognitive decline can significantly improve user satisfaction and task completion rates. We provide design guidelines for creating more accessible and user-friendly voice assistants for older adults.
