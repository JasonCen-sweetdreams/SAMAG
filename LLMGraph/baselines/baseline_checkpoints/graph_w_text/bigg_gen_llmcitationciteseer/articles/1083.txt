Open-domain question answering (ODQA) models rely on passage retrieval to identify relevant documents containing the answer. Existing methods employ a single-level attention mechanism, which can be computationally expensive and limited in capturing complex contextual relationships. We propose a hierarchical attention framework, 'HierAtt', which leverages sentence-level and document-level attention to efficiently retrieve relevant passages. Our experiments on the Natural Questions dataset demonstrate that HierAtt achieves a 15% improvement in top-1 passage retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, while reducing computational costs by 30%.
