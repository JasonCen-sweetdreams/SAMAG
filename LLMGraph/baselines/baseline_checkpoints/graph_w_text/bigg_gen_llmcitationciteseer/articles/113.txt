Query expansion is a crucial component in modern search engines, as it bridges the vocabulary gap between users' queries and relevant documents. However, existing methods often struggle with heterogeneous document collections, where different genres or formats exhibit distinct linguistic patterns. We propose a novel reinforced query expansion framework, 'RQE-Het', which leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively select expansion terms based on the document collection's characteristics. Our approach incorporates a heterogeneous document model, which captures diverse language styles and semantic relationships. Experimental results on a large-scale, heterogeneous dataset demonstrate that RQE-Het outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of retrieval effectiveness, while reducing the computational overhead.
