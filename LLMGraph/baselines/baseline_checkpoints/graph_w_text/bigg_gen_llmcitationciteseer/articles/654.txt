This paper presents a novel decentralized multi-agent coordination framework for autonomous urban traffic management. Our approach leverages distributed constraint optimization techniques to enable real-time communication and decision-making among autonomous vehicles, traffic signals, and roadside infrastructure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in reducing congestion, travel times, and emissions through extensive simulations on a realistic urban traffic network. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees on the stability and convergence of the proposed algorithm under various network topologies and traffic scenarios.
