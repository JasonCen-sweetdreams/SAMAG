Real-time data warehousing (RTDW) demands efficient indexing techniques to support fast query processing. Existing indexing methods often struggle with skewed data distributions, leading to poor performance. We propose a novel skew-tolerant hashing scheme, 'STH-index', which adapts to the underlying data skew using a combination of min-wise independent permutations and robust Bloom filters. Our experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that STH-index outperforms state-of-the-art indexing methods in terms of query response time and storage efficiency, making it an attractive solution for RTDW applications.
