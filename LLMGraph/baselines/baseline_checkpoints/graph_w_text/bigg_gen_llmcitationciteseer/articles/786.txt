Hybrid indexing systems have gained popularity for their ability to efficiently retrieve documents from large-scale datasets. However, the ranking process remains a significant bottleneck, often relying on simplistic scoring functions. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'HybridRank', which integrates neural networks with traditional indexing techniques. By learning complex patterns in document representations, HybridRank achieves significant improvements in retrieval efficiency and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We evaluate HybridRank on the ClueWeb09 dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in retrieving relevant documents for complex queries.
