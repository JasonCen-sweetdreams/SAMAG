The widespread adoption of voice assistants has transformed the way people interact with technology. However, older adults often face significant barriers when using these systems, resulting in decreased accessibility and adoption. This paper presents an exploratory study investigating the user experience of older adults with voice assistants. We conducted in-depth interviews and usability testing with 20 participants aged 65-85, identifying key challenges and design opportunities. Our findings highlight the importance of clear and consistent feedback, personalized customization, and multimodal interaction. We propose a set of design guidelines for creating more inclusive voice assistants that cater to the needs of older adults.
