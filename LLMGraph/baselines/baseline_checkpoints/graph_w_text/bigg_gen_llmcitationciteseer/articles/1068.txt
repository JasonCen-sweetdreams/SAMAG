Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, optimizing queries in these systems remains a challenging problem due to the complexity of graph data and the distributed nature of the databases. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning. We formulate the query optimization problem as a Markov decision process and train an agent to learn the optimal query plan for a given query. Our experimental results on a real-world graph dataset show that our approach outperforms traditional query optimization techniques by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
