The increasing adoption of virtual reality (VR) in education has led to a growing interest in understanding its impact on user engagement. This study investigates the effect of personalized avatars on user experience and learning outcomes in VR-based learning environments. We conducted a user study with 120 participants, randomly assigning them to either a personalized avatar or a generic avatar condition. Our results show that participants in the personalized avatar condition reported higher levels of presence, enjoyment, and motivation, leading to improved learning outcomes. We discuss the implications of our findings for the design of VR-based educational systems and highlight avenues for future research.
