In multi-agent systems, coalition formation is a fundamental problem that involves grouping agents to achieve common goals. However, in real-world scenarios, agents often have incomplete information about each other's capabilities, preferences, or intentions. This paper proposes a novel approach to coalition formation that leverages reasoning techniques to address the issue of incomplete information. Our method, called RCF, uses a combination of logic-based reasoning and probabilistic inference to identify potential coalition partners and negotiate their participation. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that RCF outperforms existing methods in terms of coalition stability and task completion rate.
