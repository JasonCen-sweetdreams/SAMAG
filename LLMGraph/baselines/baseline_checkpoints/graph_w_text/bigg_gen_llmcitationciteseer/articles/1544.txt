Autonomous vehicles require efficient route planning to minimize travel time and fuel consumption. This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework, 'GRAVO', which leverages graph attention mechanisms to optimize route selection. GRAVO consists of a high-level route planner and a low-level motion controller, both trained using reinforcement learning with graph-structured state and action spaces. We demonstrate that GRAVO outperforms traditional HRL methods and graph-based optimization techniques on a realistic urban traffic simulator, achieving a 23% reduction in travel time and 17% reduction in fuel consumption.
