In dynamic environments, efficient resource allocation is crucial for optimal system performance. This paper proposes a novel framework for coordinating heterogeneous agents using reinforcement learning. Our approach, called 'Agent Harmony', leverages a decentralized, multi-agent Q-learning algorithm to optimize resource allocation in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate that Agent Harmony outperforms traditional, manually designed allocation rules in terms of system throughput and fairness, while adapting to changing environmental conditions.
