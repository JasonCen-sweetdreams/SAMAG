Domain-specific search engines often struggle with query formulation, leading to suboptimal search results. This paper presents a novel query expansion approach that leverages pre-trained word embeddings to capture semantic relationships between terms. We introduce a domain-adaptive weighting scheme that incorporates term frequency, co-occurrence, and semantic similarity to generate an optimal set of expansion terms. Experimental results on a dataset of medical literature demonstrate significant improvements in search precision and recall, outperforming existing query expansion techniques. Our approach is particularly effective for domain-specific searches with limited training data.
