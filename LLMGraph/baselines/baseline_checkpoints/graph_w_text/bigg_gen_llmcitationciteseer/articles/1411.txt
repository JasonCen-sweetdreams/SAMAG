Entity disambiguation (ED) is a fundamental task in information retrieval, where the goal is to identify the correct entity corresponding to a mention in unstructured text. While traditional approaches rely on hand-crafted features or supervised learning, we propose a hybrid retrieval model that leverages knowledge graph embeddings to improve ED accuracy. Our approach combines a neural retriever with a knowledge graph-based ranking model, which captures both semantic and structural relationships between entities. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our hybrid model outperforms state-of-the-art ED methods, especially in scenarios with limited training data.
