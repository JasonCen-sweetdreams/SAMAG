Traditional information retrieval (IR) models struggle to capture complex relationships between documents. This paper proposes a novel approach, Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNN), which leverages graph neural networks to model documents as hierarchical structures. HGNN learns to represent documents as nodes in a graph, where edges capture semantic relationships between documents. Experimental results on the TREC-8 dataset demonstrate that HGNN outperforms state-of-the-art IR models, achieving a 12% improvement in mean average precision. Furthermore, HGNN is shown to be computationally efficient, making it a promising solution for large-scale document retrieval applications.
