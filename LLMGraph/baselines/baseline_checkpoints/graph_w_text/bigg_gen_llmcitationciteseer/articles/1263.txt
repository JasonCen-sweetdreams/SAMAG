This paper addresses the task allocation problem in IoT networks, where a large number of devices need to be assigned tasks to maximize overall network utility. We propose a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'MARL-TA', which enables devices to learn and adapt to changing network conditions. Our approach leverages a novel decentralized actor-critic algorithm, which allows agents to share experiences and learn from each other without requiring a centralized controller. Experimental results on a simulated IoT network demonstrate that MARL-TA outperforms traditional centralized optimization methods in terms of task allocation efficiency and network robustness.
