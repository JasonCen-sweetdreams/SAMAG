Query expansion is a crucial step in document retrieval systems, particularly in the medical domain where precise querying is essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment. This paper proposes a novel neural-based query expansion framework, 'MedQN', which leverages deep neural networks to capture complex semantic relationships between medical entities. MedQN incorporates domain-specific knowledge graphs and contextualized word embeddings to generate expanded queries that better capture the intent of the original query. Experimental evaluation on a large medical document collection shows that MedQN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion techniques, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision.
