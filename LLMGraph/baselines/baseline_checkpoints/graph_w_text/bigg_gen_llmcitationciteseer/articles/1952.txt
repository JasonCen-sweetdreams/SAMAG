Ad-hoc retrieval remains a challenging task in information retrieval, particularly when dealing with short or ambiguous queries. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines neural query expansion with deep learning techniques to improve retrieval performance. Our model, called NQE-DL, leverages a transformer-based architecture to learn semantic query representations and generate expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQE-DL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average improvement of 15.2% in terms of mean average precision.
