Explainable recommendation systems have gained significant attention in recent years. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) approach that leverages graph neural networks and attention mechanisms to provide transparent and interpretable recommendations. HGAT models user-item interactions as a hierarchical graph, allowing it to capture complex relationships between items and users. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HGAT on several benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance while providing explainable recommendations. Our approach has significant implications for real-world applications, such as personalized advertising and customer service chatbots.
