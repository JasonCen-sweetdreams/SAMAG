In this paper, we address the challenge of task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents possess different capabilities and resources. We propose a decentralized reinforcement learning approach, 'HRL-TA', which enables agents to learn and adapt to their environment and allocate tasks efficiently. Our approach utilizes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that integrates multiple agents' observations and actions to optimize task allocation. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that HRL-TA outperforms traditional centralized and decentralized task allocation methods, achieving higher task completion rates and reduced communication overhead.
