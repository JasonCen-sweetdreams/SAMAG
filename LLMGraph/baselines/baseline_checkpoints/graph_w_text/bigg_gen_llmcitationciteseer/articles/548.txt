The proliferation of IoT devices has generated massive amounts of real-time data, posing significant challenges for efficient query processing. This paper presents 'RTIMS', a novel in-memory column store designed specifically for IoT data streams. By leveraging column-wise storage, RTIMS achieves improved query performance and reduced memory footprint. We propose a cost-based query optimization framework that adaptively adjusts query plans based on real-time data arrival rates and query patterns. Experimental results on a large-scale IoT dataset demonstrate that RTIMS outperforms traditional row-store-based approaches by up to 3x in terms of query response time and system throughput.
