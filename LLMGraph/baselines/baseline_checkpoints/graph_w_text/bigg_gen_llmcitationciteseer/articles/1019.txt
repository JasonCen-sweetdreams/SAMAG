Modern data analytics relies heavily on distributed column-stores, which pose significant challenges in query optimization. This paper proposes a novel approach to scalable query optimization using reinforcement learning (RL). We design a hierarchical RL framework that learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and observing execution costs. Our approach adapts to changing data distributions and query patterns, achieving significant improvements in query performance compared to traditional rule-based optimizers. Experiments on a distributed column-store demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in reducing query latency and improving system throughput.
