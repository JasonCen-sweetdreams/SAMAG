Heterogeneous information networks (HINs) contain diverse node types and relations, posing significant challenges for node classification tasks. This paper proposes a novel Hierarchical Graph Attention Network (HGAT) framework that leverages both local and global structural patterns in HINs. HGAT employs a hierarchical attention mechanism to selectively focus on relevant node neighborhoods and learns node representations by aggregating features from multiple relational contexts. Experimental results on several real-world HIN datasets demonstrate that HGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in node classification tasks, especially when dealing with scarce labeled data.
