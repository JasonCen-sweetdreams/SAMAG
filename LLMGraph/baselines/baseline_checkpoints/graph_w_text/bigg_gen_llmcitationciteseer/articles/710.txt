Distributed database systems have become increasingly popular, but optimizing queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to query optimization using graph-based rewriting. Our method, called GraphOpt, represents the query as a graph and applies a set of rewriting rules to reduce the number of joins and subqueries. We demonstrate that GraphOpt outperforms existing query optimization techniques in terms of query execution time and scalability. Experimental results on a real-world dataset show that GraphOpt achieves an average speedup of 3.2x compared to traditional query optimization methods.
