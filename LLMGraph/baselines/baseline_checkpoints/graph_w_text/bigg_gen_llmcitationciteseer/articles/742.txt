Distributed databases are increasingly used to support large-scale applications, but query performance remains a major bottleneck. This paper presents a novel adaptive data replication strategy, 'ADRep', which dynamically adjusts data placement based on query patterns and workload characteristics. ADRep leverages machine learning-based forecasting to predict query hotspots and proactively replicates data to reduce latency and improve throughput. Experimental results on a real-world e-commerce dataset demonstrate that ADRep achieves up to 3x query performance improvement compared to existing replication strategies while minimizing storage overhead.
