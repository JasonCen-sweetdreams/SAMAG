Zero-shot learning (ZSL) enables models to recognize unseen classes without training data. However, existing ZSL methods often rely on hand-crafted attributes or class embeddings, which can be limited and inflexible. This paper proposes a novel graph-based relational embedding (GURE) framework, which learns to encode semantic relationships between classes and attributes in a graph structure. By leveraging graph convolutional networks and a novel relational attention mechanism, GURE achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple ZSL benchmarks, outperforming existing methods by up to 12% in terms of harmonic mean. Furthermore, our approach is more interpretable and adaptable to new classes and attributes.
