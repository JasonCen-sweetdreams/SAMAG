This paper presents a novel approach to decentralized task allocation for multi-agent systems using learned graph representations. We propose a graph neural network-based framework that learns to represent the problem domain as a graph, and then uses this representation to allocate tasks to agents in a decentralized manner. Our approach is evaluated on a range of scenarios, including search and rescue, and surveillance, and is shown to outperform traditional methods in terms of task completion efficiency and adaptability to changing environment conditions. The proposed framework has the potential to be applied in a wide range of domains, including robotics, smart cities, and IoT.
