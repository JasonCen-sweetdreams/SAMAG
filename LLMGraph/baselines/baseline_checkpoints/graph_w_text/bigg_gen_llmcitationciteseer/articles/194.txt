The rapid growth of digital data necessitates efficient indexing techniques for real-time information retrieval. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical neural network (HNN) architecture for document indexing, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and memory requirements of traditional indexing methods. Our HNN model leverages a hierarchical representation of documents, allowing for efficient querying and filtering of relevant documents. Experimental results on a large-scale document corpus demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art indexing techniques in terms of query response time and accuracy.
