Query expansion is a crucial step in information retrieval systems, aiming to improve the retrieval performance by adding relevant terms to the original query. This paper proposes a novel approach, 'DeepQE', which leverages deep neural ranking models to learn the semantic relationships between query terms and expansion candidates. By incorporating a hierarchical attention mechanism and a contrastive learning objective, DeepQE significantly outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving a 15% improvement in mean average precision on several benchmark datasets. Our approach is particularly effective for short and ambiguous queries, where traditional methods often struggle.
