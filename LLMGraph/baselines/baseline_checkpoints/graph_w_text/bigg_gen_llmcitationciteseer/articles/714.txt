Distributed query optimization in heterogeneous database systems is a complex problem, and join ordering is a crucial step in this process. This paper proposes a novel approach, called 'HetJoin', that leverages a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques to efficiently order joins in distributed queries. HetJoin adapts to varying data distributions, network latencies, and hardware heterogeneities, thereby optimizing query performance. Our experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HetJoin outperforms state-of-the-art join ordering algorithms by up to 30% in terms of query execution time.
