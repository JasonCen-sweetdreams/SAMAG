Real-time data warehousing has become increasingly important in various applications, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. However, query optimization for real-time data warehousing remains a significant challenge, particularly when using column stores. This paper proposes a novel query optimization framework, 'RTCOL', which leverages the column-store architecture to minimize query latency. We introduce a column-based data partitioning strategy that reduces the number of disk I/O operations, and develop a cost-based optimization algorithm that considers both query latency and data freshness. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RTCOL outperforms state-of-the-art query optimization techniques by up to 40% in terms of query latency.
