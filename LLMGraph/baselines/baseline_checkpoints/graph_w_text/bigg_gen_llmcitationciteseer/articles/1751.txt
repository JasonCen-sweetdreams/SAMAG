In multi-agent systems, negotiation is a key mechanism for resolving conflicts and achieving mutually beneficial agreements. However, in dynamic environments, agents must adapt to changing circumstances and re-negotiate to maintain cooperation. This paper presents a novel framework for coordinated negotiation strategies, incorporating machine learning-based opponent modeling and probabilistic planning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a simulated supply chain management scenario, showcasing improved negotiation outcomes and increased robustness to environmental changes.
