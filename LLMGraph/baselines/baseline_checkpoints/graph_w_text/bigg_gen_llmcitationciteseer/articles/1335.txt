Real-time data warehousing has become crucial for timely business insights, but optimizing complex queries in these systems remains a significant challenge. This paper presents 'QRex', a novel query optimization framework that leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to efficiently explore the vast space of possible query execution plans. QRex utilizes a custom-designed DRL agent that incorporates domain knowledge and feedback from the underlying database system, achieving up to 3x improvement in query execution time and 2x reduction in resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art optimization techniques.
