In this paper, we propose a decentralized task allocation framework for heterogeneous multi-agent systems, where agents with different capabilities and resources need to collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. We leverage graph neural networks (GNNs) to model the agent interactions and develop a distributed optimization algorithm that allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities and the task requirements. Our approach is evaluated on a variety of synthetic and real-world scenarios, demonstrating improved task completion rates and reduced communication overhead compared to traditional centralized task allocation methods.
