Distributed information retrieval (DIR) systems face scalability challenges as the volume of data grows exponentially. This paper presents a novel hierarchical indexing approach, 'HIQ', which significantly improves query efficiency in DIR systems. HIQ leverages a multi-level index structure to prune unnecessary document collections, reducing the number of node interactions and minimizing network latency. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that HIQ achieves an average query speedup of 3.5x compared to state-of-the-art indexing methods, while maintaining retrieval accuracy.
