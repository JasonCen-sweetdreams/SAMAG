This paper presents a decentralized coordination framework for autonomous agents using hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). We propose a novel HRL architecture that enables agents to learn both high-level goals and low-level actions in a decentralized manner, without requiring a centralized controller. Our approach leverages the concept of option learning to identify meaningful sub-goals and allocate tasks to individual agents. Experimental results in a simulated multi-agent environment demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional decentralized reinforcement learning methods in terms of coordination efficiency and adaptability to changing environments.
