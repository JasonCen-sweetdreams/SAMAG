This paper presents a novel neural ranking model, 'NQEPR', which integrates query expansion and passage retrieval to improve document ranking for information retrieval tasks. Our approach leverages a transformer-based architecture to learn query representations and expand them using relevant terms from the document collection. The expanded queries are then used to retrieve and rank passages, enabling more accurate relevance assessment. Experimental results on the TREC Deep Learning Track dataset show that NQEPR outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving a 12% increase in NDCG@10.
