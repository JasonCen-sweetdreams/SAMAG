As cloud-based database services continue to proliferate, optimizing query performance for multi-tenant environments has become a pressing concern. This paper presents 'MTQO', a novel query optimization framework that leverages machine learning and graph-based modeling to minimize contention and improve resource utilization. Our approach involves offline profiling of tenant workloads to construct a knowledge graph, which is then used to predict and mitigate resource bottlenecks at runtime. Experimental results on a real-world cloud database demonstrate significant reductions in query latency and improved overall system throughput.
