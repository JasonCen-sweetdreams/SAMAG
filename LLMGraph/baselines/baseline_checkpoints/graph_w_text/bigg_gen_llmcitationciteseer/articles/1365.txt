As robots increasingly share workspaces with humans, effective collaboration requires intuitive and efficient communication. This paper explores the impact of embodiment on human-robot collaboration, focusing on gesture-based interaction. We designed a user study where participants worked with a robotic arm to complete tasks, using either explicit gestures or implicit body language. Our results show that embodied interaction significantly improves task performance, reduces errors, and enhances user satisfaction. We also identify key gestural features that facilitate effective collaboration and discuss implications for designing more human-centered robot interfaces.
