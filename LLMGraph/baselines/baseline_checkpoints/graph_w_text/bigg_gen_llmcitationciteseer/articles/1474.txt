Query expansion (QE) is a crucial component in ad-hoc retrieval, aiming to bridge the vocabulary gap between queries and documents. This paper proposes a neural QE approach, dubbed NeuroQE, which leverages pre-trained language models to generate semantically meaningful expansion terms. NeuroQE integrates a novel attention mechanism to weigh the importance of each expansion term and adaptively selects the most informative ones. Experimental results on several TREC datasets demonstrate that NeuroQE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art QE methods, achieving an average improvement of 15% in terms of mean average precision.
