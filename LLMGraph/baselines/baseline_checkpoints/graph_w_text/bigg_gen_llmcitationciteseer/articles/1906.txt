The increasing adoption of Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platforms has led to a growing need for efficient query optimization techniques. Existing approaches often focus on single-tenant databases, neglecting the unique challenges of multi-tenancy. This paper presents a novel, scalable query optimization framework, 'MQO', designed specifically for multi-tenant DBaaS platforms. MQO leverages a combination of machine learning-based workload classification and dynamic resource allocation to minimize query latency and improve overall system throughput. Experimental results on a large-scale, real-world DBaaS platform demonstrate that MQO outperforms state-of-the-art query optimizers by up to 35% in terms of query response time.
