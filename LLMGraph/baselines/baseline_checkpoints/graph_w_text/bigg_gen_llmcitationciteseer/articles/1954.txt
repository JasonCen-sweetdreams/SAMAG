 Commonsense reasoning is a crucial aspect of human-level Artificial Intelligence (AI). Recent advances in knowledge graph embedding have shown promise in this direction. However, existing methods suffer from limited contextual understanding and lack of hierarchical structure. We propose 'HierAtt', a novel knowledge graph embedding framework that incorporates hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture complex relationships between entities and their contexts. Our experiments on the ConceptNet dataset demonstrate significant improvements in link prediction and question answering tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art models by up to 12%.
