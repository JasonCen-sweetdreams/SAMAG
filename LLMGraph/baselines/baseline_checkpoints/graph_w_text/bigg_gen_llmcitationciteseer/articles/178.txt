Ad-hoc retrieval tasks require effective document ranking methods to retrieve relevant documents for a given query. Traditional methods rely on handcrafted features and term-matching techniques, which often fail to capture complex query semantics. This paper proposes a novel neural ranking model, 'NQG-Rank', which leverages query graphs to model intricate relationships between query terms. Our approach represents queries as graphs, where nodes correspond to terms and edges capture their contextual dependencies. We then employ a graph neural network to learn a continuous representation of the query graph, which is used to rank documents based on their relevance. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that NQG-Rank outperforms state-of-the-art neural ranking models, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain.
