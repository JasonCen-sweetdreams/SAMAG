Real-time data warehousing has become essential for businesses to make timely decisions. However, optimizing queries for low latency remains a significant challenge, especially when dealing with large datasets. This paper presents a novel query optimization framework, 'ColumnOpt', that leverages column stores to accelerate query processing. We propose a cost-based optimization algorithm that takes into account the storage layout, data distribution, and query patterns to select the most efficient execution plan. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that ColumnOpt achieves an average speedup of 3.5x compared to traditional row-store-based query optimization techniques.
