Entity disambiguation is a fundamental task in natural language processing and information retrieval. Existing approaches often struggle with scalability and accuracy when dealing with large knowledge graphs. This paper introduces 'KG-ED', a novel entity disambiguation framework that leverages knowledge graph embeddings and graph attention networks. KG-ED represents entities as dense vectors and captures their relationships using graph attention, enabling efficient and effective disambiguation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that KG-ED outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
