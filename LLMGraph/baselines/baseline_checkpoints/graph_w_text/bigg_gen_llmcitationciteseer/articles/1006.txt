 Query optimization is a critical component of distributed database systems, as it directly impacts system performance and scalability. This paper proposes a novel approach to query optimization using reinforcement learning, dubbed 'AdaptQL'. We model query optimization as a Markov decision process and train a deep Q-network to adaptively select the optimal query plan based on runtime statistics and system workload. Experimental results on a real-world distributed database system demonstrate that AdaptQL outperforms traditional query optimizers in terms of query latency and resource utilization, while also exhibiting improved robustness to workload fluctuations.
