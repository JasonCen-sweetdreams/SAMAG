Multi-agent systems have applications in various domains, but efficient task allocation remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework, 'HRL-ATA', which enables autonomous task allocation in dynamic environments. HRL-ATA consists of a high-level task allocator that assigns tasks to agents and a low-level controller that learns to execute tasks efficiently. We introduce a novel reward function that balances task completion rates and resource utilization, leading to improved system performance. Experimental results on a simulated warehouse management scenario demonstrate that HRL-ATA outperforms existing methods in terms of task completion time and resource efficiency.
