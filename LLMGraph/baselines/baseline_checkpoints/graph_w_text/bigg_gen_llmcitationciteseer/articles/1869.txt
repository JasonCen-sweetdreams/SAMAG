This paper presents a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning approach for adaptive traffic signal control. We model the traffic network as a decentralized Markov decision process, where each agent represents a traffic signal controller. The agents learn to coordinate their actions to minimize congestion and reduce travel times. We introduce a novel reward function that incorporates real-time traffic data and road network topology. Experimental results on a simulated traffic network demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional approaches in reducing congestion and improving traffic flow.
