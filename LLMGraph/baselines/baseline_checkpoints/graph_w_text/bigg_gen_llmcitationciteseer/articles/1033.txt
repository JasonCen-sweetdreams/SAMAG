The proliferation of IoT devices has created a pressing need for efficient resource allocation mechanisms. This paper proposes an autonomous agent-based framework, 'AARA', that leverages multi-agent systems to optimize resource allocation in IoT networks. AARA employs a decentralized architecture, where agents representing IoT devices and network resources engage in negotiation-based decision-making. We introduce a novel utility function that incorporates device-specific QoS requirements, energy efficiency, and network latency. Simulation results demonstrate that AARA outperforms traditional centralized approaches in terms of resource utilization, network throughput, and device satisfaction.
