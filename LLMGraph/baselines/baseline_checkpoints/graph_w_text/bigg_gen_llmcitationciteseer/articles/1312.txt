Real-time data warehousing poses significant query optimization challenges, particularly when dealing with rapidly changing data and complex queries. This paper introduces 'RTOpt', a novel query optimization framework that leverages incremental view maintenance to reduce query latency and improve system throughput. We propose a cost-based optimization approach that dynamically adjusts view maintenance schedules based on query patterns and data updates. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RTOpt achieves an average query latency reduction of 35% compared to traditional query optimization techniques.
