State-of-the-art neural ranking models for document retrieval often rely on computationally expensive query-document interaction mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical query representation framework, 'HiQR', which leverages the semantic structure of queries to reduce the search space and accelerate retrieval. We introduce a query decomposition strategy that identifies key concepts and their relationships, enabling the construction of a hierarchical query graph. Experimental results on the TREC-CAR dataset demonstrate that HiQR achieves significant speedups over existing methods while maintaining comparable retrieval effectiveness.
