Real-time information retrieval (RTIR) systems face the challenge of efficiently filtering large document collections to retrieve relevant documents within strict time constraints. This paper proposes a novel deep neural ranking model, 'DNRM-FILTER', which leverages a hierarchical neural architecture to learn robust document representations and filter out irrelevant documents in a single pass. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DNRM-FILTER on three benchmark datasets, achieving significant improvements in filtering efficiency and retrieval accuracy compared to state-of-the-art filtering methods.
