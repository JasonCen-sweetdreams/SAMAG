Semantic search has become increasingly important in modern information retrieval systems. However, query expansion techniques often rely on manual feature engineering and heuristics. This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using reinforcement learning, where an agent learns to select relevant expansion terms based on the semantic context of the query. We develop a customized reward function that incorporates both relevance and diversity metrics, and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval performance on several benchmark datasets. Our approach is particularly effective for long-tail queries, where traditional methods often struggle.
