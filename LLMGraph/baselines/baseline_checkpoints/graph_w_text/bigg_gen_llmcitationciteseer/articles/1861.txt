Anomaly detection in graph-structured data is a crucial task in various domains, including social networks, bioinformatics, and cybersecurity. Existing methods often rely on shallow graph representations, neglecting the complex hierarchies present in real-world graphs. This paper introduces 'HierCon', a novel deep learning framework that leverages hierarchical contrastive learning to identify anomalies in graph-structured data. By recursively applying contrastive learning at multiple scales, HierCon captures rich contextual information and detects anomalies more effectively than state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of HierCon in terms of detection accuracy and robustness to graph perturbations.
