Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various applications, but their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical concern. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing attack methods on GNNs, including graph structure perturbations, node feature manipulation, and black-box attacks. We also introduce a new benchmark dataset, GNN-Bench, which includes a diverse set of graph structures and attack scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed benchmark is more challenging than existing datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this area. Finally, we discuss potential defense strategies and open challenges in adversarial robustness for GNNs.
