Distributed graph databases have become increasingly popular for storing and querying large-scale graph data. However, query processing in these systems remains a significant bottleneck. This paper presents a novel indexing technique, 'GraphIndex', which leverages the structural properties of graphs to accelerate query execution. GraphIndex employs a hierarchical indexing scheme that combines vertex-centric and edge-centric indexing, enabling efficient query processing and minimizing communication overhead. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that GraphIndex outperforms existing indexing techniques by up to 3x in query response time.
