Session-based search is a common scenario where users interact with a search engine multiple times to refine their search query. Traditional ranking models, however, fail to capture the contextual dependencies between queries within a session. This paper presents a novel deep neural network architecture, called SessionRank, which leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms to model the query-document relationships within a session. Experimental results on the TREC Session Track dataset demonstrate that SessionRank outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of nDCG and ERR metrics, especially for longer search sessions.
