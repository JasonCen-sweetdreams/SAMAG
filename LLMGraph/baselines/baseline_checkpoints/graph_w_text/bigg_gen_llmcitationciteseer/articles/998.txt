Distributed relational databases are increasingly important for handling large-scale data processing. However, optimizing subquery processing in such systems remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages reinforcement learning to optimize subquery execution plans. Our method, called 'RL-SubQ', uses a deep Q-network to learn the optimal execution order of subqueries based on the system's current workload and resource utilization. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that RL-SubQ outperforms state-of-the-art optimization techniques, reducing query execution time by up to 35% and improving system throughput by 20%.
