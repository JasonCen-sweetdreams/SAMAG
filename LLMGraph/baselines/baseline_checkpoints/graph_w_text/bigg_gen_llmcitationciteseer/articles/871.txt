Voice assistants have become ubiquitous, but their adoption by older adults is hindered by accessibility barriers. This study investigates the impact of accessibility features on the usability of voice assistants for older adults. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 30 participants, aged 65-85, using a customized voice assistant with varying levels of accessibility features. Our results show that features like voice.commands, screen reader integration, and simplified dialogue flows significantly improve task completion rates and user satisfaction. We provide design recommendations for inclusive voice assistants and discuss implications for future research.
