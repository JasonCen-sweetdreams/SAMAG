In multi-agent systems, efficient task allocation is crucial for achieving complex goals. This paper introduces a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework, 'HTA', which enables autonomous task allocation among agents. HTA consists of a high-level task allocator that assigns tasks to agents based on their capabilities and a low-level controller that executes tasks using reinforcement learning policies. We propose a novel curriculum-based learning approach that adaptively adjusts the task difficulty and reward functions to facilitate efficient learning. Experimental results on a simulated disaster response scenario demonstrate that HTA outperforms traditional manual allocation methods and achieves near-optimal task completion rates.
