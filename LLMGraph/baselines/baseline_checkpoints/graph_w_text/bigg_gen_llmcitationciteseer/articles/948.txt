E-commerce search engines rely on effective query expansion techniques to retrieve relevant products. In this paper, we propose a novel neural query graph (NQG) model that learns to expand queries by incorporating semantic relationships between entities and attributes. Our approach leverages a graph attention mechanism to identify important nodes and edges in the query graph, allowing for more accurate and diverse expansion terms. Experimental results on a large e-commerce dataset demonstrate that NQG outperforms state-of-the-art query expansion methods, achieving a 12% improvement in mean average precision.
