We model the problem as a Markov game, where each agent represents a microgrid and learns to optimize its local resource allocation policy while interacting with neighboring agents. We propose a novel algorithm, 'MARL-DR', which combines deep Q-networks with a graph attention mechanism to capture the complex interactions between agents. Experimental results on a simulated smart grid environment demonstrate that MARL-DR outperforms traditional centralized optimization methods and achieves significant reductions in energy losses and costs.",

This paper proposes a novel query-adaptive document expansion technique, 'QADE', which selectively expands relevant documents based on the query context. QADE leverages a learned query-document similarity metric to identify the most informative passages and dynamically adjusts the document representation.

This paper proposes a novel query expansion framework that leverages hierarchical graph neural networks (HGNNs) to model complex query relationships. Our approach represents queries as graphs, where nodes correspond to terms and edges capture their semantic dependencies. The HGNN learns to aggregate and propagate information across the graph, generating a set of expanded queries that better capture user intent. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness compared to traditional query expansion methods.",

This paper explores the concept of embodiment in VR and its impact on gesture recognition. We designed an experiment to investigate how users' sense of embodiment influences their gesture patterns and recognition accuracy. Our results show that users with a higher sense of embodiment exhibit more natural and consistent gestures, leading to improved recognition accuracy.

This paper proposes a novel approach to query expansion using reinforcement learning. We frame the query expansion problem as a Markov decision process, where the agent learns to select the most informative terms to add to the query. Our agent is trained using a reward function that balances the trade-off between precision and recall. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms traditional query expansion methods, achieving significant improvements in mean average precision and reciprocal rank.",

We incorporate entity disambiguation and relation inference to generate high-quality expansion terms, and demonstrate significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness on several benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we show that KG-Expan can be seamlessly integrated with existing neural retrieval models, making it a versatile and practical solution for real-world IR applications.",

This study investigates how VA design features, such as facial expressions and tone of voice, affect user trust and perceived reliability.

Results show that VAs with more human-like features were perceived as more trustworthy, but this effect was mitigated when the VA made mistakes. Our findings have implications for the design of VAs in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare and finance.",

This paper proposes a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, 'HMA-RL', that coordinates traffic signals across a network of intersections. HMA-RL consists of a top-level controller that learns to allocate green light times to different intersections and a set of low-level agents that adjust their signal phases based on local traffic conditions. We evaluate HMA-RL on a real-world traffic dataset and show that it outperforms traditional fixed-time and actuated signal control methods in terms of average travel time and queue length.",

Traditional approaches rely on heuristics and rule-based systems, which can lead to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn join order optimization. We model the query graph as a neural network and train it on a large dataset of queries. Our experiments demonstrate that the GNN-based approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of query execution time and plan quality. We also explore the scalability of our approach on large-scale distributed database systems.",

Our method, GraphRL, learns to optimize query plans by interacting with the database and receiving rewards based on query execution time and resource utilization.

Traditional query optimization techniques rely on rule-based and cost-based approaches, which can be inefficient and inaccurate for complex queries. This paper proposes a novel machine learning-based query optimization framework, 'ML-QO', which leverages query execution plans and runtime statistics to predict optimal query plans. We develop a deep learning model that incorporates both syntactic and semantic features of queries, and demonstrate its effectiveness on a range of big data benchmarks.

We introduce a hierarchical framework, 'AgentCoord', which consists of a high-level coordinator that learns to allocate resources and a set of low-level agents that execute tasks. The coordinator uses a deep Q-network to learn a policy for resource allocation, while the agents employ deep deterministic policy gradients to optimize their task execution. Experimental results on a simulated grid-world environment demonstrate that AgentCoord outperforms traditional decentralized approaches in terms of resource utilization and task completion rate.",

This paper proposes a novel hybrid indexing technique, 'HIQ', that combines the benefits of B+ trees and bitmap indexing. HIQ dynamically adjusts the indexing strategy based on query patterns, data distribution, and storage constraints. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate that HIQ achieves an average query performance improvement of 35% compared to traditional indexing methods, while reducing storage overhead by 20%. We also provide theoretical bounds on the optimality of HIQ under various query workloads.",
