  A scientific paper must include these four elements:
    1. **title**: concise and descriptive of the research question  
    2. **keywords**: terms that capture the core topics  
    3. **abstract**: a brief summary of question, methods, results, and conclusions  
    4. **citations**: list of papers you will cite

  **Your task:**  
  - If you want to generate a version of paper, your paper should cite {min_citations} to {max_citations} papers, you can decide the number according to your needs. 
  - Based strictly on the **Final Proposal** and **Current Draft Metadata**, refine the **final paper** and response in JSON format only, which can be loaded by json.loads:

  ```json
  {{
    "title":    "(string)",
